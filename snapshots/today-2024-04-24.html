Struggle to Get a Grip on ‘Keystone Species’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
More than 50 years after Bob Paine’s experiment with starfish, hundreds
of species have been pronounced “keystones” in their ecosystems. Has the
powerful metaphor lost its mathematical meaning?

<li>Key takeaways from Tesla’s quarterly earnings report</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Tesla reported first quarter earnings yesterday. The electric car
company’s profits fell 55%, and revenue fell 9%. But shares rose more
than 10% in after-hours trading following the shareholder update and
earnings call. Here are a few things we learned from the report:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
CEO Elon Musk said <strong>Tesla “should be thought of as an AI/robotics
company,” </strong>and that “if you value Tesla as an auto company,
that’s the wrong framework.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Plans for a sub-$30,000 EV</strong> haven’t been entirely
scrapped, as previously reported. The company said it will “accelerate”
the launch of new and more affordable models, but indicated “that any
new, cheaper vehicle would not necessarily be entirely new nor unlock
massive new savings through an all-new production process,”
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-863qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3lFM2yK_9TWk5rW3DcxDF9k5gFCW1Zt9LT5_H5B9W7hp-Vn7wyw21W8fL7Lx10dqwsVCWsnB4RtZ1TW1C8LqT8FkwDvW4MxQ-44Csc9mW8jDz2-4FR2rZW5qnj2_7kv4SgV4gskX63JJ1yVZ_vT21--prwN8Jcx2NVkrTjW1d-ZDg2N1b7fW4-bmTX8pW_ttW281MBb4yD9wnW4dC08p459pfmW5M49tP2z08VkW4_hbXy259WnkW34b7Dv4w18ZRW6lfJjz1v0SZwV9nMVl719KRZN41FcDdr9s33W6bKrFZ1fnf3fW2-TWL272VpthW4xrFf3395Vxtf8lJyVP04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin. The robotaxi, however, will rely on a new
platform.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tesla’s energy business is growing</strong> faster than its car
business. The company deployed just over 4 gigawatts of energy storage
in the first quarter of the year, and its energy revenue was up 7% from
a year ago. Profits from the business more than doubled.
</li>
<li>
Musk still wants to sell a “general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot,”
and said <strong>the Optimus robot</strong> would be in “limited
production” in a factory doing “useful tasks” by the end of this year.

offshore wind auctions</a> through 2028, with four of those auctions
happening by the end of 2024. President Biden has a goal of 30 gigawatts
of offshore wind capacity by 2030, but the industry has been blown off
course thanks to inflation and disrupted supply chains. The Interior
Department has held four offshore wind auctions so far during Biden’s
presidency. The new schedule is an attempt to “jump-start the fledgling
offshore wind sector” by expanding development potential,

from <em>Carbon Brief</em> found that a second Trump presidency would
likely cause the U.S. to miss its 2030 climate pledges, could lead to an
additional 4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, and result in
more than $900 billion in damages. “A second Trump term that
successfully dismantles Biden’s climate legacy would likely end any
global hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5 [degrees Celsius],” the
report said.

a tank turn, and has one motor for each wheel, offering serious control

just a beautiful vehicle that seems to stay true to its design roots.
The range, at about 293 miles, is relatively low but the sticker price,
at about $150,000, is very high. It’ll be on sale in the U.S. in the

iOS into giving me EU DMA features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This
works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first
appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you
physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where
you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by
the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to
convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in
fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure
not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to
disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi
router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement
where there’s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was
reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it
was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi
has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of
figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be
discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which
Apple determines where an iPhone is from.</p>

many of which are the first of their kind — how does he think about cash
flow, about technological innovation, about risk? Robinson Meyer is
executive editor of Heatmap News; Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems
engineering professor at Princeton, is off this week.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong> Robinson Meyer:</strong> I think one thing you’ve said often is
that we have — and you alluded to at the beginning of the conversation —
is that we haven’t built manufacturing in this country, basically, for
40 years. I think one note we’ve seen both from the president and from
the partisan laws passed by Congress and the president — but also,
frankly, from a more bipartisan set of lawmakers — is that there’s a lot
of eagerness for that to change. So from your point of view as someone
kind of in the weeds every day, what needs to change for the U.S. to
build manufacturing and heavy industry domestically again?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jigar Shah: </strong>Well, let’s start by saying that I think
that the BIL and IRA that’s passed has been a huge success story, right?
We’ve gotten 500 announcements of new factories in the United States.
And so, these are communities like the one that I grew up in, that had
the seventh largest steel mill in the country that shut down while I was
there. And all of the people who went to high school there expected to
have a job there, and they don’t. Right? These are folks who are pretty
pissed off about the fact that their lot in life, really, was destined
to not have family-sustaining jobs for 40 years, right?<br/> <br/> And
so now we’re giving people hope again that, for folks who have high
school educations, that they can actually support their families and do
these things, right? So in that perspective, we’re winning, right? <br/>
<br/> But on the other side, we still have a lot more work to do, right?
So when you think about the underlying conventional wisdom, the
conventional wisdom is that you’re going to start a factory, China’s
going to dump product in the United States and going to put you out of
business, right? And so the local bank is saying, prove to me that
China’s not going to dump product and put you out of business. Those old
habits die hard, right? <br/> <br/> Now, the president has put together
all sorts of belts and suspenders, but I don’t think that’s clear. I’ll
give you an example. So in the EV supply chain — we have an
extraordinary amount of lithium in this country. We made the
announcements at Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge, as well as recycling
for Li-Cycle and Redwood. But we’ve got additional abilities to get
lithium over in Arkansas and Salton Sea in California. <br/> <br/> And a
lot of folks are saying, lithium prices are down 70% from their highs,
right? So therefore there’s no way you can make it work right now.
Lithium was $5,000 a unit in 2020. Today it’s $20,000 a unit. It was as
high as $80,000 — $20,000 is still 4x what it was in 2020. And so
there’s a way to make it profitable, but we also have the 30D program
where a lot of automakers get incentives to buy locally for domestic
content. <br/> <br/> And so I feel like there’s just so much in the IRA,
that the belts and suspenders approach that the administration took is
not something that most people understand. And as a result, a lot of
dollars are not moving from the commercial markets. We’ve got to step in
and move them.

<h2 id="openbsd-as-a-daily-driver">OpenBSD as a daily driver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews,
and this time it’s even relevant to me as I’m exploring OpenBSD myself.
OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article
about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first
place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly
funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the
base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an
excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with
its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm
window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With
that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop
computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and
if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to
suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately
limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system?
There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I
take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that,
a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS
mode. ↫ Morgan I’ll be using this guide over the coming days to make
sure I end up with something usable. I still haven’t decided on what
desktop environment I want to go for – I’m not interested in running
GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I’d also love
to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its
repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0
was just released). There’s a small chance I might suck it up and use
one of those “build your own desktop environment” options, but I have no
idea which one I should go for.</p>

Senate passes bill to force TikTok divestment or ban</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday to send legislation
to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to
divest the popular short video app’s U.S. assets within about nine
months or face a</p>
<p>Ban.</p>
<p>The measure, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday,
has been driven by concerns that China could access Americans’ data or
surveil them with the app and Biden has said he will sign it into
law.</p>
<p>“For years we’ve allowed the Chinese Communist party to control one
of the most popular apps in America that was dangerously shortsighted,”
said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence
Committee. “A new law is going to require its Chinese owner to sell the
app. This is a good move for America.”</p>
<p>TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share U.S. user
data with the Chinese government, has argued the law amounts to a ban
that would violate the U.S. free speech rights of its users.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told
its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the
legislation.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of
the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok… This
is the beginning, not the end of this long process,” TikTok told
employees on Saturday in an email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favor of the bill.</p>

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">
Embeddable Game Engine
</h1>
<p>
<img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240> Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where
we were building cross-platform libraries for mobile developers, we
wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming capabilities for our users in the
form of adding 2D or 3D content to their mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired
libraries.
</p>
<p>
For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years,
and we contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).
</p>
<p>
Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great
UI support called Urho, and the other one was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>,
which had a great IDE, but did not support being embedded.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be
turned into such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my
meetings, those notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft
acquisition, but from what I can remember Juan told me, "Godot is not
what you are looking for" in two dimensions, there were no immediate
plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was not as advanced
as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.
</p>
<p>
We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go
into becoming a
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and
mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR
headsets. Sadly, Microsoft’s management left UrhoSharp to die.
</p>
<p>
Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the
most popular open-source projects in the world.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Faolan-Rad">@Faolan-Rad</span>
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a
patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library that could be embedded into
applications. I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a>
and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed
Godot content into their application.
</p>
<p>
However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one
Godot game as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks
at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk Software</a> wanted to take this
further. They wanted to host independent Godot scenes in their app and
have more control over those so they could sprinkle Godot content at
their heart’s content on their mobile app
(<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)
</p>
<p>
They funded some initial work to do this and hired
<a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely Kis’s company</a> to do this work.
</p>
<p>
Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited
from GodotCon and I decided to turn my
<a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype
Godot on iPad</a> into a
<a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete product</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of
Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to
productize and polish this patch for general consumption.
</p>
<p>
Now, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch
under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary Godot scenes into
their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot
scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is
done, I will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift
users (bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an
exercise to the reader).
</p>
<p>
It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in
Godot land.

<h2 id="white-house-updates-national-suicide-prevention-strategy">White
House updates national suicide prevention strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House on Tuesday unveiled an updated national
strategy on suicide prevention that includes more emphasis on health
equity and diversity and the mental-health impact of social media,
revising its decade-old plan amid a national rise in suicide rates.</p>
<p>Second gentleman Doug Emhoff launched the new strategy at the White
House, which he prefaced with words of comfort and encouragement.</p>
<p>“It’s OK to talk about this, as tough as this topic is,” he said.
“So, that’s why it’s good that we’re all here today together. It’s
important we do this, because as we all know, suicide affects everyone.
Doesn’t matter your age, race, gender or where you live. It impacts all
of us.”</p>
<p>The U.S. remains in a small clique of about 40 mostly high-income
nations that have national plans to combat a menace that has left no
society unscarred.</p>
<p>In a push for more countries to develop national strategies in 2018,
the World Health Organization noted that “only a few countries in the
low-income and middle-income categories have adopted a national suicide
prevention strategy, even though 79% of suicides occur in these
settings.”</p>
<p>American health professionals told VOA a national plan is essential
to tackling the problem. </p>
<p>“The new national strategy focuses on a”whole of society” approach,
which is unique —and critical — because no single entity alone can
reduce suicide rates. But together, we have a real opportunity for
impact,” Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer of the National
Alliance on Mental Illness, told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>Doctors who worked with the White House on the plan noted that not
all its recommendations are strictly medical. Many are social and
involve being more open about a matter that is often seen as taboo. </p>
<p>“When it comes to a national strategy, you’re actually looking to
employ a multipronged approach,” Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical
officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told VOA.
“So, you would be looking to increase your mental health professional
workforce that is culturally aligned with the population.</p>
<p>“But you’d also be looking to other things that low- and
middle-income countries can do more readily, such as increasing
interpersonal connectedness in schools and in workplaces — really these
community-based approaches that have been found to be incredibly
effective at reducing suicides. So, things like addressing loneliness,
addressing interpersonal violence.”</p>
<p>American actor Ashley Judd, who spoke at the White House on Tuesday,
also stressed the importance of legitimizing mental illness. Her mother,
musician Naomi Judd, committed suicide in 2022. </p>
<p>“She won several Grammys, and she left country music better than she
found it,” Judd said of her mother, who was 76. “She also lived most of
her life with an untreated and undiagnosed mental illness that lied to
her and stole from her. And it stole from our family, and she deserved
better.”</p>
<p>Another issue the updated plan wrestled with is a uniquely American
one. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 55% of
American suicides are committed with firearms. </p>
<p>“There is a very strong section on firearm suicide prevention in the
national strategy,” Moutier said, noting that the federal strategy
mentions the important role of state-level red flag laws that would
restrict firearms access for buyers who may harm themselves or
others. </p>
<p>The new strategy also emphasizes the value of “lived experience” —
the validity of survivors’ stories and those of their loved ones, who
are scarred by the suicide. </p>
<p>Musician Aloe Blacc spoke Tuesday of how he uses music to heal after
the 2018 suicide of his close friend, Swedish electronica artist Tim
Bergling – better known by his stage name, Avicii.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of his friend’s death, Blacc recorded a version of
his hit, “Wake Me Up.”He also recorded a version he sang in Mandarin and
Spanish. </p>
<p>And on Tuesday, Blacc, sitting in the high-ceilinged, marble-walled
room on the White House campus, burst into spontaneous song. His warm
tenor filled the cavernous room as he sang a gospel standard, “This
Little Light of Mine.”</p>
<p>“Just remember,” he said. “You are the light.”</p>
<p>Blacc offered some simple advice to those who themselves may be
struggling or know someone who is. </p>
<p>“I want to encourage all of us here today and all of us watching to
recognize the role that we can play, the positive role that we can play
in someone else’s life,” he said. </p>
<p>Or, as Wesolowski said, “The most important thing we can do is show
up. …The action of reaching out is more important than the words you
say, and sometimes it can make all the difference.”</p>
<p>The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention shared with VOA this
list of international suicide hotlines.</p>

Talk About AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Tesla doesn’t want to talk about its cars — or at least, not about the
cars that have steering wheels and human drivers.
</p>
<p>
Despite weeks of reports about Tesla’s manufacturing and sales woes —
price cuts, recalls, and whether a new, cheaper model would ever come to
fruition — CEO Elon Musk and other Tesla executives devoted their
quarterly earnings call largely to the company’s autonomous driving
software. Musk promised that the long-awaited program would
revolutionize the auto industry (“We’re putting the actual ‘auto’ in
automobile,” as he put it) and lead to the “biggest asset appreciation
in history” as existing Tesla vehicles got progressively better
self-driving capabilities.
</p>
<p>
In other Tesla news, car sales are falling, and a new, cheaper vehicle
will not be constructed on an all-new platform and manufacturing line,
which would instead by reserved for a from-the-ground-up autonomous
vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Here are five big takeaways from the company’s earnings and conference
call.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tesla’s car business is slowing down …
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The company reported that its “total automotive revenues” came in at
$17.4 billion in the first quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Its
overall revenues of $21.3 billion, meanwhile, were down 9% from a year
ago. The earnings announcement included a number of explanations for the
slowdown, which was even worse than Wall Street analysts had expected.
</p>
<p>
Among the reasons Tesla cited for the disappointing results were arson
at its Berlin factory, the obstruction to Red Sea shipping due to Houthi
attacks from Yemen, plus a global slowdown in electric vehicle sales “as
many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs.” The combined effects of
these unfortunate events led the company to undertake a well-publicized
series of price cuts and other sweeteners for buyers, which dug further
into Tesla’s bottom line. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav
Taneja, said that the company’s free cash flow was negative more than $2
billion, largely due to a “mismatch” between its manufacturing and
actual sales, which led to a buildup of car inventory.
</p>
<p>
The bad news was largely expected — the company’s shares had fallen 40%
so far this year leading up to the first quarter earnings, and the past
few weeks have featured a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_self"><u>steady
drumbeat of bad news</u></a> from the automaker, including layoffs and a
major
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-recall" target="_self"><u>recall</u></a>.
The company’s profits of $1.1 billion were down by more than 50%, short
of Wall Street’s expectations — and yet still, Tesla shares were up more
than 10% in after-hours trading following the shareholder update and
earnings call.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>… but that’s fine, because Tesla is really an AI company
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The strange thing about Tesla is that it makes the overwhelming majority
of its money from selling cars, but has become the world’s most valuable
car company thanks to investors thinking that it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-earnings-ai-elon-musk" target="_blank">more
of an artificial intelligence company</a>. <span></span>It’s not
uncommon for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his executives to start talking
about their Full Self-Driving technology and autonomous driving goals
when the company’s existing business has hit a rough patch, and today
was no exception.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s value per share was about 33 times its earnings per share by the
end of trading on Monday, comparable to how investors evaluate software
companies that they expect to grow quickly and expand profitability in
the future. Car companies, on the other hand, tend to have much lower
valuations compared to their earnings — Ford’s multiple is 12, for
instance, and GM’s is 6.
</p>
<p>
Musk addressed this gap directly on the company’s earnings call. He said
that Tesla “should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,” and that
“if you value Tesla as an auto company, that’s the wrong framework.” To
emphasize just how much the company is pivoting around its self-driving
technology, Musk said that “if somebody believes Tesla is not going to
solve autonomy they should not be an investor in the company.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
One reason investors value Tesla so differently relative to its peers is
that they do, actually, expect the company will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-earnings-ai-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>make
a lot of money</u></a> using artificial intelligence. No doubt with that
in mind, executives made sure to let everyone know that its artificial
intelligence spending was immense: The company’s free cash flow may have
been negative more than $2 billion, but $1 billion of that was in
spending on AI infrastructure. The company also said that it had
“increased AI training compute by more than 130%” in the first quarter.
</p>
<p>
“The future is not only electric, but also autonomous,” the company’s
investor update said. “We believe scaled autonomy is only possible with
data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster. We
have, and continue to expand, both.”
</p>
<p>
Musk described the company’s FSD 12 self-driving software as “profound”
and said that “it’s only a matter of time before we exceed the
reliability of humans, and not much time at that.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>There will be some kind of new car, and it will be ahead of
schedule, but that’s all Musk is willing to say
</h3>
<br>
<p>
The biggest open question about Tesla is what would happen with its
long-promised Model 2, a sub-$30,000 EV that would, in theory, have mass
appeal. <em>Reuters</em>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-2024-04-05/" target="_blank">reported</a>
that the project had been cancelled and that Tesla was instead devoting
its resources to another long-promised project, a self-driving
ride-hailing vehicle called the “robotaxi.”
</p>
<p>
Musk tweeted that <em>Reuters</em> was “lying” but never directly denied
the report or identified what was wrong with it, instead saying that the
robotaxi would be unveiled in August. He
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1780376546148327690" target="_blank"><u>later
followed up</u></a> to say that “going balls to the wall for autonomy is
a blindingly obvious move. Everything else is like variations on a horse
carriage.”
</p>
<p>
Before the call, Wall Street analysts were begging for a confirmation
that newer, cheaper models besides a robotaxi were coming.
</p>
<p>
“If Tesla does not come out with a Model 2 the next 12 to 18 months, the
second growth wave will not come,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives
wrote in a note last week. “Musk needs to recommit to the Model 2
strategy ALONG with robotaxis but it CANNOT be solely replaced by
autonomy.”
</p>
<p>
Anyone who expected to get their answers on today’s call, though, was
likely kidding themselves.
</p>
<p>
Tesla announced today it had updated its planned vehicle line-up to
“accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously
communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,” and that
“these new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize
aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our
current platforms.” Musk added on the company’s earnings call that a new
model would not be “contingent on any new factory or massive new
production line.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Some analysts attributed the share pricing popping after
hours to this line, although it’s unclear just how new this new car
would be.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s shareholder update indicated that any new, cheaper vehicle would
not necessarily be entirely new nor unlock massive new savings through
an all-new production process. “This update may result in achieving less
cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow
our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain
times,” the update said.
</p>
<p>
Of the robotaxi, meanwhile, the company said it will “continue to pursue
a revolutionary ‘unboxed’ manufacturing strategy,” indicating that just
the ride-hailing vehicle would be built entirely on a new platform.
</p>
<p>
Musk also discussed how a robotaxi network could work, saying that it
would be a combination of Tesla-operated robotaxis and owners putting
their own cars into the ride-hailing fleet. When asked directly about
its schedule for a $25,000 car, Musk quickly pivoted to discussing
autonomy, saying that when Teslas are able to self-drive without
supervision, it will be “the biggest asset appreciation in history,” as
existing Teslas became self-driving.<br/><br/>When asked whether any new
vehicles would “tweaks” or “new models,” Musk dodged the question,
saying that they had said everything they had planned to say on the new
cars.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Energy and charging are growing at a nice clip
</h3>
<br>
<p>
One bright spot on the company’s numbers was the growth in its sales of
energy systems, which are tilting more and more toward the company’s
battery offerings.
</p>
<p>
Tesla said it deployed just over 4 gigawatts of energy storage in the
first quarter of the year, and that its energy revenue was up 7% from a
year ago. Profits from the business more than doubled.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s energy business is growing faster than its car business, and
Musk said it will continue to grow “significantly faster than the car
business” going forward.
</p>
<p>
Revenues from “services and others,” which includes the company’s
charging network, was up by a quarter, as more and more other electric
vehicle manufacturers adopt Tesla’s charging standard.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Oh, and robots
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Another speculative Tesla project is Optimus, which the company
describes as a “general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot capable of
performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring.” Like many
robotics projects, the most the public has seen of Optimus has been
intriguing video content, but Musk said that it was doing “factory tasks
in the lab” and that it would be in “limited production” in a factory
doing “useful tasks” by the end of this year. External sales could begin
“by the end of next year,” Musk said.
</p>
<p>
But as with any new Tesla project, these dates may be aspirational. Musk
described them as “just guesses,” but also said that Optimus could “be
more valuable than everything else combined.”

<h2 id="bidens-climate-cash-is-finally-pouring-in">Biden’s Climate Cash
Is Finally Pouring In</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zOTIzMDQzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTAxMTcwOX0.U0EexC_DlnKCohJD5GCtub5TllaY4Vz3ouuCqlHku44/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It took a year and a half, but over the past month, money from the
Inflation Reduction Act has started to flow out in earnest. Among the
grants given just in the past four weeks are:
</p>
<p>
$20 million for ice cream factories in Tennessee and Vermont so they can
replace their natural gas boilers with climate-friendly ones.
</p>
<p>
$51 million for a manufacturing plant that makes bathroom faucets and
showerheads in Arizona.
</p>
<p>
And $6.97 billion to stand up a new green community bank that will help
small farms, small businesses, households, and schools replace fossil
fuels in their buildings and install electric vehicle chargers.
</p>
<p>
The size of these IRA programs can be difficult to put into perspective,
but here’s one way of looking at it: The $37 billion in climate funding
spent over the past month
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/us/politics/house-foreign-aid-bill.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceeds</u></a>
what the recent foreign aid bill will give to Israel, Taiwan, and
humanitarian aid in Gaza, combined.
</p>
<p>
As the election approaches, the Biden administration is spending funds
from the IRA much faster than it was last year. As of October 2023, a
Heatmap analysis
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self"><u>found,</u></a>
only $11.8 billion of the law’s roughly $110 billion in grant funds had
been spent. What’s been awarded in <em><em>just the past month</em></em>
represents about a quarter of the total grant funding allocated under
the law.
</p>
<p>
Most of that comes from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion pot of money meant to seed green banks
around the country. The bulk of its awards — $20 billion — went to three
coalitions — Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, and Power
Forward Communities — made up of nonprofits, state-level green banks,
and community development financial institutions, which are a type of
federally certified nonprofit bank.
</p>
<p>
They’ll use that money to invest in new solar farms, decarbonize homes
and apartment buildings, and make communities more resilient to extreme
weather and other climate impacts. The returns from those projects will
then go back to the coalition and allow them to fund more projects over
time. If successful, that will keep the $20 billion cycling in the
economy long after other IRA funding has dried up.
</p>
<p>
Many of the projects funded over the past month work this way, Sam
Ricketts, a veteran of Jay Inslee’s presidential campaign and the
cofounder of the climate consulting firm C2 Strategies, told me. They
are meant to unleash more funding than their dollar amounts would
suggest, getting private investors to match or exceed the government’s
investment. “You look at EPA’s $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund
— they talk about each of those dollars leveraging seven more. We’re
talking about a massive transformation here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“With the industrial decarbonization program” — a $10 billion set of
awards to more than 130 companies, funded with
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$6
billion of IRA money</u></a> — “the number that DOE is touting isn’t $6
billion. It’s $20 billion, because all the projects require cost
sharing. That money is going to leverage much more” investment, Ricketts
said. (The total funding amount also represents awards from the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-4-billion-tax-credits-build-clean-energy-supply" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>48C
tax credit,</u></a> which is meant to help build new energy and critical
mineral projects in the United States.)
</p>
<p>
The industrial sector is expected to be the economy’s most
emissions-intensive sector by the middle of this decade. The slew of new
projects funded by the Energy Department include first-of-a-kind efforts
to build facilities that will accomplish key industrial processes —
including
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-chemicals-and-refining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chemical</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-cement-and-concrete" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cement</u></a>
production,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-iron-and-steel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ironmaking</u></a>,
and even
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-heat#foodbev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>glass
bottlemaking</u></a> — while producing vastly less carbon pollution than
facilities make today.
</p>
<p>
“The cool thing about each of these programs is they’re all creating new
terrain. [The EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund] is going to be opening
up new market segments, in some cases creating entirely new markets for
sustained, leveraged, and recycled public investment in clean energy,”
Ricketts said. “The industrial decarbonization programs are
first-of-a-kind inroads into a sector that has traditionally been called
hard to abate.”
</p>
<p>
Yet another new EPA program, dubbed “Solar for All,” will spend $7
billion to help 900,000 households get rooftop solar or join a community
solar project. It’s joined by the
<a href="https://www.acc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>American
Climate Corps</u></a>, another new IRA program that will train and
employ 20,000 young people to work on conservation or clean energy
projects.
</p>
<p>
At an Earth Day event in a Virginia park on Monday, President Joe Biden
bragged about the Solar for All and American Climate Corps programs.
“You’ll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those
solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and
so much more,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Biden is “is overseeing the single biggest federal investment in
tackling the climate crisis in our nation’s history,” Representative
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at the event.
</p>
<p>
The IRA’s more than $100 billion in grant programs do not represent all
— or even most — of what the climate law will eventually spend into the
economy. The overwhelming majority of the law’s support for
decarbonization will come in the form of tax credits and other payments
made to households and companies. These subsidies, which by some
estimates
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs#:~:text=That%20same%20month%2C%20Goldman%20Sachs,trillion%20from%202023%20to%202032." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceed</u></a>
$1 trillion, will help build new wind and solar farms, manufacture
grid-scale batteries and electric vehicles, and refine minerals needed
for zero-carbon technologies.
</p>
<p>
Data on the uptake of these tax credits and subsidies is not yet
available. In February,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/transcript-shift-key-episode-three-ira" target="_self"><u>an
analysis</u></a> from three independent modeling organizations found
that the IRA was decarbonizing the vehicle fleet at roughly the expected
pace, but that carbon reductions from the power grid lagged behind what
was expected.
</p>
<p>
While rich communities can sometimes fund the kind of weatherization or
decarbonization projects paid for by these new green banks by raising
revenue or taking out bonds, that’s not a possibility for poor
communities, he said. “This is still new territory,” Advait Arun, an
energy finance researcher at the Center for Public Enterprise, told me.
“It’s written and structured in a way that’s meant to mobilize private
investment that wouldn’t get to these communities on their own.”
</p>
<p>
The new EPA program will also pay for “technical assistance,” which will
teach local nonprofit, government, and banking leaders how to
<em><em>think </em></em>about financing and managing long-term clean
energy and climate projects.
</p>
<p>
“This is an unprecedented infusion to ensure that these projects that we
want for local decarbonization and resilience actually reach the
communities that need them,” Arun said.
</p>
<p>
Many of the IRA’s incentives can — and likely will — be stacked on top
of each other, and the same projects may be able to qualify for grants,
loan programs, and tax incentives. So a community solar project that is
funded by the EPA green bank will also qualify for its tax credits. So
will a large-scale building retrofit or a geothermal project. Because
those tax credits cover a larger share of projects in low-income
communities, they could sometimes cover more than half a project,
Ricketts said.
</p>
<p>
“The money’s coming. The dollars are here,” Ricketts told me. And
they’re not going to stop.
</p>
<p>
“This cavalry is going to be followed by an even bigger force, which is
the tax incentives,” he said. “You’ve got the right hand jab of grants,
and you’ve got the big left hook of tax incentives. And combined are the
fists of climate-fighting fury.”

<h2 id="myanmar-junta-slams-us-aid-plan">Myanmar junta slams US aid
plan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Myanmar’s ruling junta, the State Administrative
Council, is criticizing a U.S. aid package that is being funneled
through opponents of the regime, saying the United States should
consider whether its actions amount to support for terrorism. </p>
<p>The assistance marks the first implementation of the BURMA Act, part
of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act aimed at helping
pro-democracy forces battling the SAC. </p>
<p>Under the act, the aid is intended to strengthen federalism in
Myanmar by providing nonlethal assistance to armed groups, helping
pro-democracy organizations, assisting aid organizations operating from
Thailand, and financing investigations of junta human rights violations.
The aid is restricted to ensure it does not benefit the SAC or any
entity affiliated with the Myanmar military. </p>
<p>“We believe the U.S. is manipulating Myanmar to counter China’s
influence in the region,” the junta said in a statement provided to VOA
on March 29. “Despite the U.S. presenting itself as a champion of
democracy, the aid disproportionately benefits Myanmar’s opposition
groups, particularly the National Unity Government (NUG) and the
People’s Defense Force (PDF).” </p>
<p>The NUG is the opposition’s shadow government; the PDF is made up of
civilian armed groups battling the military. </p>
<p>The junta statement calls on the United States to review its aid
allocation “to reassess whether their actions, which some label as
terrorism, represent a legitimate path to reclaiming power.” </p>
<p>The junta, which has killed and imprisoned thousands of people since
overthrowing the democratically elected government in February 2021,
accuses the NUG and PDF of responsibility for the civilian deaths. The
statement did not elaborate on the charge that U.S. support for
resistance groups in Myanmar is linked to Myanmar’s adversarial
relationship with China. </p>
<p>The promise of the BURMA Act </p>
<p>The Burma Unified Through Rigorous Military Accountability Act,
commonly called the BURMA Act, says it aims to “continue to support the
people of Burma in their struggle for democracy, human rights, and
justice.” </p>
<p>It identifies specific resistance groups as beneficiaries, including
the NUG, and the National Unity Consultative Council, or NUCC, which
comprises several opposition groups. </p>
<p>Also named are the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which
is made up of members of the ousted Myanmar parliament; the civil
disobedience movement; “and other entities in Burma and in other
countries” that seek to “bring about an end to the military junta’s
rule.” </p>
<p>The act promises to “hold accountable perpetrators of human rights
violations,” and to “hold accountable the Russian Federation and the
People’s Republic of China.” </p>
<p>It provides $75 million for refugee assistance programs, including in
Thailand and India, and $25 million for “technical support and
non-lethal assistance” to the NUG and PDF. Smaller amounts are earmarked
for governance programs, documentation of atrocities, and assistance to
political prisoners, Rohingya and deserters from the junta’s
military. </p>
<p>The Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group, have
faced persecution and discrimination in Myanmar for decades. In 2017, a
military crackdown by the Myanmar army forced hundreds of thousands of
Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, seeking refuge from the
violence and persecution. </p>
<p>The act authorizes appropriations to be allocated annually from
fiscal years 2023 through 2027, with $121 million earmarked for FY
2024.  </p>
<p>Process of the funding </p>
<p>During debate on the bill, the U.S. House of Representatives
initially proposed a more limited $50 million aid package but agreed to
the larger sum advocated by the Senate before final passage. </p>
<p>“We are pleased with the $121 million proposed by the Senate, instead
of the $50 million proposed by the House. However, we believe this
amount is insufficient, and should be closer to $300 million to meet the
humanitarian needs on the ground,” said James Shwe, from the Los Angeles
Myanmar Movement, which works with Myanmar activists in the United
States. </p>
<p>In a Zoom call with VOA, Shwe also criticized what he sees as the
high administrative costs of aid distribution. </p>
<p>“Because of the lack of state-to-state cooperation in a case such as
Myanmar, where the aid is meant for humanitarian assistance, but not for
the ruling power, this leads to several layers of management,” he
said. </p>
<p>“The aid is funneled through USAID partners, the biggest of which is
the U.N., which has to operate under the rules of the junta. In many
cases, the U.N. will in turn deal with [non-governmental organizations].
The NGO then needs to distribute that aid to [civil society
organizations] on the ground. This leads to ever-increasing
administrative costs and less actual assistance to those in need.” </p>
<p>Shwe said administration costs eat up around 45% of aid funds. </p>
<p>“Only $75 million of the $121 million is allocated for cross-border
aid, which we believe will be more effective than channeling funds
through the U.N., the largest partner of USAID,” Shwe added. But he
welcomed the lawmakers’ decision to specifically name the NUG and the
NUCC in the act, ensuring that they will play a role in the allocation
of the funds. </p>
<p>Hopes for assistance amid U.S. engagement </p>
<p>Hopes for continued humanitarian assistance to Myanmar are on the
rise after U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet and USAID
Assistant Administrator Michael Schiffer met this month with
representatives from the NUG. </p>
<p>“The meeting underscores the ongoing commitment of the United States
to engage with Myanmar’s NUG leadership and support their endeavors to
promote democracy, peace, and stability in the region,” said an April 11
State Department press release. </p>
<p>Chollet also met in late March with ethnic armed organizations allied
with the NUG.</p>
<p>“Met today with leaders of Burma’s ‘K3C’ ethnic group alliance on
their extraordinary efforts to pursue a federal democracy in Burma,” he
wrote on X on March 28. “We discussed steps for the international
community to expand assistance to those in need and secure a better
future for the people of Burma.”</p>
<p>The K3C alliance, comprising the Kachin Independence Organization,
Karen National Union, Karenni National Progressive Party, and Chin
National Front, is politically aligned with the NUG and collaborates
militarily with its armed wing, the People’s Defense Force. </p>
<p>“We briefed them on the political and military situation in our
state, as well as the humanitarian situation,” said Aung San Myint,
secretary of the Karenni National Progressive Party, who shared details
of the meeting with VOA by phone.  </p>
<p>“Following our presentation, they assured us of continued
collaboration as the U.S. Department of State. … We have hope for
increased humanitarian aid as discussions progress with U.S.
officials.”</p>

sanctions four over ‘malicious cyber activity’ for Iran’s military</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. ramped up its sanctions against Iran on
Tuesday, designating four people and two companies it says were
“involved in malicious cyber activity” on behalf of the country’s
military.  </p>
<p>“These actors targeted more than a dozen U.S. companies and
government entities through cyber operations, including spear phishing
and malware attacks,” the U..S Treasury Department said in a
statement. </p>
<p>The individuals and companies were working “on behalf of” Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC),
the Treasury said. </p>
<p>“Iranian malicious cyber actors continue to target U.S. companies and
government entities in a coordinated, multi-pronged campaign intended to
destabilize our critical infrastructure and cause harm to our citizens,”
the Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence,
Brian Nelson, said in a statement. </p>
<p>“The United States will continue to leverage our whole-of-government
approach to expose and disrupt these networks’ operations,” he
added.  </p>
<p>Tuesday’s sanctions are the latest to be levied against Tehran by the
United States and its allies for supporting anti-Israel proxies in the
Middle East and for providing military support for Russia’s war in
Ukraine.  </p>
<p>Last week, the U..S and Britain announced widespread sanctions
against Iran’s military drone program in response to Tehran’s
large-scale attack against Israel earlier this month.  </p>
<p>That attack came in response to an April 1 airstrike on the Iranian
consulate in Damascus — widely blamed on Israel — that killed seven
members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two
generals. </p>
<p>A day after those sanctions were unveiled, the U.S. fined a
Thailand-based firm $20 million for more than 450 possible Iran
sanctions violations. </p>
<p>They included processing close to $300 million in wire transfers for
a company jointly owned by the National Petroleum Company of Iran.  </p>
<p>Alongside Tuesday’s sanctions, the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have indicted the four individuals
in question “for their roles in cyber activity targeting U.S. entities,”
the Treasury Department said.</p>

<h2 id="fedora-40-released-with-kde-plasma-6-and-gnome-46">Fedora 40
released with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a big day for Fedora users such as myself – and especially for
Fedora KDE users, also such as myself. Fedora 40 has been released
today, and while the main focus is always on the GNOME release –
although not everyone is happy about that – the various other spins, in
Fedora parlance, have also seen major updates. Most prominently among
them is the KDE spin, which ships with KDE’s recent megarelease, KDE
Plasma 6. Starting at the top, Fedora 40 Workstation comes with the
latest GNOME release, 46, which we covered when it was released earlier
this year. It also comes with IPV4 Address Conflict Detection to resolve
duplicate IPV4 addresses in the same physical network, and the PyTorch
machine learning framework is now in the Fedora software repositories
for easier installation and implementation by developers – a harbinger
of what’s to come. The KDE spin comes, as already mentioned, with KDE
Plasma 6, and inherits the non-GNOME improvements and fixes as well, of
course. There’s also countless other spins covering pretty much every
desktop environment and window manager under the sun, and Fedora 40 is
also the first release to implement the new naming scheme for Fedora’s
various immutable editions – the Atomic Desktops.</p>

government agrees to $138.7M settlement over FBI’s botching of Nassar
assault allegations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — The U.S. Justice Department announced a $138.7 million
settlement Tuesday with more than 100 people who accused the FBI of
grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against Larry Nassar
in 2015 and 2016, a critical time gap that allowed the sports doctor to
continue to prey on victims before his arrest. </p>
<p>When combined with other settlements, roughly $1 billion now has been
set aside by various organizations to compensate hundreds of women who
said Nassar assaulted them under the guise of treatment for sports
injuries. </p>
<p>Nassar worked at Michigan State University and also served as a team
doctor at Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics. He’s now serving decades in
prison for assaulting female athletes, including medal-winning Olympic
gymnasts. </p>
<p>Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said Nassar betrayed
the trust of those in his care for decades, and that the “allegations
should have been taken seriously from the outset.” </p>
<p>“While these settlements won’t undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our
hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the
critical support they need to continue healing,” Mizer said of the
agreement to settle 139 claims. </p>
<p>The Justice Department has acknowledged that it failed to step in.
For more than a year, FBI agents in Indianapolis and Los Angeles had
knowledge of allegations against him but apparently took no action, an
internal investigation found. </p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray was contrite — and very blunt — when he
spoke to survivors at a Senate hearing in 2021. The assault survivors
include decorated Olympians Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla
Maroney. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry that so many different people let you down, over and over
again,” Wray said. “And I’m especially sorry that there were people at
the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and
failed.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a search, investigators said in 2016 that they had found images
of child sex abuse and followed up with federal charges against Nassar.
Separately, the Michigan attorney general’s office handled the assault
charges that ultimately shocked the sports world and led to an
extraordinary dayslong sentencing hearing with gripping testimony about
his crimes. </p>
<p>“I’m deeply grateful. Accountability with the Justice Department has
been a long time in coming,” said Rachael Denhollander of Louisville,
Kentucky, who is not part of the latest settlement but was the first
person to publicly step forward and detail abuse at the hands of
Nassar. </p>
<p>“The unfortunate reality is that what we are seeing today is
something that most survivors never see,” Denhollander told The
Associated Press. “Most survivors never see accountability. Most
survivors never see justice. Most survivors never get restitution.” </p>
<p>Michigan State University, which was also accused of missing chances
over many years to stop Nassar, agreed to pay $500 million to more than
300 women and girls who were assaulted. USA Gymnastics and the U.S.
Olympic and Paralympic Committee made a $380 million settlement.</p>

workers. We’ll set the stage for the big financial release. Plus, high
mortgage rates bring about a real estate quandary. And as part of

connects the dots between the record-breaking 2021 North American
wildfire season and the “one-in-a-thousand-year” heat dome that settled
over the Pacific Northwest in June of that year. The study, published
in<em><em> Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em></em>, found that
human-caused climate change increased both the size and longevity of the
27-day heat dome, the former by about 34%, and the latter by 60%. About
one-third of the area that burned was covered by the dome. The authors
note that the heat wave would have been 150 times less likely to happen
without climate change. “Climate change will continue to magnify heat
dome events, increase fire danger, and enable extreme synchronous
wildfire in forested areas of North America,” they wrote.

fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for
more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems,
and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All
users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable
branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is
that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless
you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to
NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.</p>

<p>Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution – think Solaris – has a new
SPARC milestone. It’s one of the few platforms still actively supporting
SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it’s an
important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here
roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying
illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional
illumos changes from the m28 sparc release – if that release didn’t work
on your system, this one won’t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I’m still looking
for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than

first go-to.</p>

id="columbias-ongoing-protests-cause-canceled-classes-and-increased-tensions">Columbia’s
ongoing protests cause canceled classes and increased tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Columbia University held virtual classes Monday on the
sixth continuous day of student protests over the Israel-Hamas
conflict.</p>
<p>University president Nemat “Minouche” Shafik sent an email to the
Columbia community announcing that classes would be held virtually.</p>
<p>“The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days,”
Shafik wrote. “These tensions have been exploited and amplified by
individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus
to pursue their own agendas. We need a reset.”</p>
<p>More than 100 students were arrested at the school April 18, after
the university’s president authorized police to clear away protesters.
Some of the students also received suspension notices from the
school.</p>
<p>Columbia’s action prompted an onslaught of pro-Palestinian
demonstrations at other universities and responses from faculty and
politicians.</p>
<p>The arrests occurred after students calling themselves Columbia
University Apartheid Divest erected dozens of tents on a lawn at the
center of the campus, establishing it as the “Gaza Solidarity
Encampment.”</p>
<p>Following the arrests and the demolition of the original encampment,
another pro-Palestine encampment sprung on an adjacent lawn.</p>
<p>Students aren’t the only demonstrators experiencing tensions on
campus and with the university administration.</p>
<p>Monday morning, Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai was
denied entry to the university for an attempted pro-Israel
counter-protest on the occupied lawn after he refused to comply with the
university’s counter-protest policies.</p>
<p>“I am a professor here; I have every right to be everywhere on
campus. You cannot let people who support Hamas on campus, and me, a
professor, not on campus. Let me in now,” he said after Columbia COO
Cass Halloway stopped him and other pro-Israel protesters at the
entrance gates.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly called student protesters “violent maniacs” and
“pro-Hamas terrorists.” A petition calling for Davidai’s dismissal has
amassed nearly 9,000 signatures as of last Thursday night; additional
grievances have been shared on social media and with the university.</p>
<p>Some Jewish students at Columbia say that many criticisms of Israel
are antisemitic and make them feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Since the arrests, many student groups and Columbia affiliate groups
have released statements condemning the university’s decision to arrest
students, citing discriminatory enforcement of rules that limit
students’ freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Monday, hundreds of faculty members from across Columbia and Barnard
staged a rally and walkout to urge the university to reverse the
students’ suspensions. Some faculty members wore their graduation
regalia and sashes reading “We support students.”</p>
<p>The backlash from the protests has even reached the ear of U.S.
President Joe Biden. When asked about the recent events at the
university by reporters Monday, Biden said, “I condemn the antisemitic
protests. That’s why I have set up a program to deal with that. I also
condemn those who don’t understand what’s going on with the
Palestinians.”</p>
<p>Other campuses, such as Yale, Stanford, and New York University have
also rallied around the Palestinian cause, calling for their
universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel and for a
ceasefire in Gaza. Many have put up tent encampments on their campuses.
About 50 students were arrested at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut,
Monday after they refused to leave their encampment.</p>
<p>Student protesters at Columbia have urged organizers of rallies
outside the campus to “remember what we are protesting for” and focus on
the war in Gaza, rather than just expressing solidarity with
protesters.</p>
<p>The university announced Tuesday morning that classes on the
Morningside main campus, where the protests are taking place, will be
offered in a hybrid format for the remainder of the Spring semester. The
last day of classes is April 29. </p>

<p>With the passage of the national security supplemental bill through
the House of Representatives on Saturday, Punchbowl News noted today,
President Joe Biden became the winner of this Congress. When the
Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, they vowed to
impeach Biden and members of his Cabinet, overturn the signature
legislation the Democrats had passed in 2021 and 2022, and force the
Democrats to accept draconian immigration policies.</p>

<p>Marijuana is a rare consensus issue in politically divided America,
with polls showing that 88 percent of Americans support at least
partially legalizing the drug. But cannabis advocates say neither of the
leading presidential candidates are capitalizing on shifting attitudes.
