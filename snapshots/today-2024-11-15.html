<p>
The new Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet that launched in October features the
same processor as the previous-generation model. But it has more memory,
a higher-resolution rear camera, and support for wireless charging. It’s
a pretty modest update when it comes to hardware, which probably helps
explain why it’s already on sale for $55 during […]

<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News</p>
I’ve been captivated by digital technology ever since computers began
making their mark in Iran in the late ’90s. Back then, owning a computer
was a luxury, but I finally got my hands on one when I started college
in 1999, starting my undergrad studies in English Literature. By that
time, major search engines like […]

Writing and technology—either together or separately—have always played
a big role in my identity. I was a middle-class Brazilian kid in the
early 1990s. So I would write about my feelings in a journal, read and
replicate poems, play the synthesizer, and eventually type on our family
Windows 98 computer.  As a teenager, some of […]

GOG brings old games to new PCs, VMWare goes free(er), Apple smart

<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Game Platform GOG no longer goes by the name Good Old Games, since GOG
now offers new titles as well. But GOG hasn’t exactly given up on its
roots. Today the company announced the GOG Preservation Program, an
initiative that helps ensure old games are compatible with current and
future PCs. In other tech news […]

<h2 id="ghc-9.12.1-alpha3-is-now-available">GHC 9.12.1-alpha3 is now
available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-alpha3 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-14
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
third alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha3">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha3/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
