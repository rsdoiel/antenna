TerraMaster recently launched 9 new Network Attached Storage (NAS)
devices featuring the company’s latest software and processors based on
Intel’s 12th-gen Alder Lake-N or Alder Lake-U architecture. One of the
more intriguing models is the TerraMaster F8 SSD Plus. Not only is it

<h2 id="internet-archive-hacked-and-victim-of-ddos-attacks">Internet
Archive hacked and victim of DDoS attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Internet Archive’s “The Wayback Machine” has suffered a data breach
after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user
authentication database containing 31 million unique records. News of
the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to
archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the
hacker, stating that the Internet Archive was breached. “Have you ever
felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the
verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See
31 million of you on HIBP!,” reads a JavaScript alert shown on the
compromised archive.org site. ↫ Lawrence Abrams at Bleeping Computer To
make matters worse, the Internet Archive was also suffering from waves
of distributed denial-of-service attacks, forcing the IA to take down
the site while strengthening everything up. It seems the attackers have
no real motivation, other than the fact they can, but it’s interesting,
shall we say, that the Internet Archive has been under legal assault by
big publishers for years now, too. I highly doubt the two are related in
any way, but it’s an interesting note nonetheless. I’m still catching up
on all the various tech news stories, but this one was hard to miss. A
lot of people are rightfully angry and dismayed about this, since
attacking the Internet Archive like this kind of feels like throwing
Molotov cocktails at a local library – there’s literally not a single
reason to do so, and the only people you’re going to hurt are underpaid
librarians and chill people who just want to read some books. Whomever
is behind this are just assholes, no ifs and buts about it.</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-windows-7">Goodbye Windows 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>I finally seem to be recovering from a nasty flu that is now wreaking
havoc all across my tiny Arctic town – better now than when we hit -40 I
guess – so let’s talk about something that’s not going to recover
because it actually just fucking died: Windows 7. For nearly everyone,
support for Windows 7 ended on January 14th, 2020. However, if you were
a business who needed more time to migrate off of it because your CEO
didn’t listen to the begging and pleading IT department until a week
before the deadline, Microsoft did have an option for you. Businesses
could pay to get up to 3 years of extra security updates. This pushes
the EOL date for Windows 7 to January 10th, 2023. Okay but that’s still
nearly 2 years earlier than October 8th, 2024? ↫ The Cool Blog I’d like
to solve the puzzle! It’s POSReady, isn’t it? Of course it is! Windows
Embedded POSReady’s support finally ended a few days ago, and this means
that for all intents and purposes, Windows 7 is well and truly dead. In
case you happen to be a paleontologist, think of Windows Embedded
POSReady adding an extra two years of support to Windows 7 as the
mammoths who managed to survive on Wrangel until as late as only 4000
years ago. Windows 7 was one of the good ones, for sure, and all else
being equal, I’d choose it over any of the releases that cam after. It
feels like Windows 7 was the last release designed primarily for users
of the Windows platform, whereas later releases were designed more to
nickle and dime people with services, ads, and upsells that greatly
cheapened the operating system. I doubt we’ll ever see such a return to
form again, so Windows 7 might as well be the last truly beloved Windows
release. If you’re still using Windows 7 – please don’t, unless you’re
doing it for the retrocomputing thrill. I know Windows 8, 10, and 11 are
scary, and as much as it pains me to say this, you’re better off with 10
or 11 at this point, if only for security concerns.</p>

One of the features of using a custom email address with every service
or website is that it’s easy to see when information gets sold to third
parties. Today’s inbox let me know it’s time to shut down my Macy’s
alias, and also that Macy’s as a company is in some trouble.

<p>
Selling off customer data for reasons other than partnering or targeted
advertisements is a short term cash grab move. Interestingly their stock
price isn’t showing this despiration yet. If I were a market gambler
this might be something I’d try to capitalize on.
