## Blinken Meets Top China Foreign Minister Candidate Before Taiwan Elections

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is holding one-hour talks with veteran Chinese diplomat Liu Jianchao Friday morning, a day before Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections — a test for efforts to stabilize tensions between the United States and China.  


Washington has cautioned Beijing against using the elections as a pretext for instability in the Taiwan Strait. 


Liu, who heads the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department, is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the United States since U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit south of San Francisco on November 15. 


A source familiar with the meeting said that in diplomacy, it is crucial to convey messages directly to China on "the importance of peace and stability in the region ahead of the Taiwan elections, and in light of recent PRC provocations in the South China Sea.” 


This week, the Biden administration announced it would send a high-level unofficial delegation to Taipei after the elections, citing a longstanding precedent. The move is perceived as an effort to preempt a strong reaction from Beijing. 


A Chinese spokesperson said Thursday that Taiwan’s elections are “purely China’s internal affairs” and that China firmly opposes any form of official contact between the United States and Taiwan. 


The winner of Taiwan’s presidential election will be inaugurated May 20. The transition period is seen as sensitive in cross-strait relations. 


Liu is seen as a leading contender to be China’s next foreign minister, according to some media reports and analysts.


It is unusual for the minister of the International Liaison Department, a unit under the Communist Party’s Central Committee, to visit the United States, according to Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund. 


“The most likely explanation for this visit, and the reason that he is being received by Blinken, is that Liu is likely to be China's next foreign minister. The visit provides an opportunity for the U.S. to take his measure in advance of his formal appointment, likely at the upcoming National People’s Congress” in early March, Glaser told VOA. 


Senior U.S. officials attending Friday’s meeting include the State Department’s top diplomat on East Asian and Pacific affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, and its China coordinator, Mark Lambert.  


Communication between the world’s two largest economies will continue after Taiwan’s elections, as senior U.S. and Chinese officials are to attend next week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Blinken and Chinese Premier Li Qiang will attend the annual economic meetings at the Swiss mountain resort.    


Blinken’s talks with Chinese officials are described as ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, responsibly manage differences between the two nations and address various issues. These include global and regional security concerns, such as Russia’s war against Ukraine, as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. 


According to some estimates, about half of all global trade flows through the Taiwan Strait, and its stability is critical to the global economy.


VOA’s Cindy Saine contributed to this report.

## California is facing a budget mess. It’s not alone.

date: 2024-01-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>California, home of the fifth largest economy in the world, has a budget deficit of between $38 billion and $68 billion, depending on the estimate. But even with the economy doing pretty well across the country, other states have budget woes as well, many of which were papered over by federal pandemic aid. Also on the program: a look at falling wholesale prices and increased oversight of Boeing.</p>

## My night at the Dean campaign

date: 2024-01-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'd love to tell you a story about the time I had the authority to post to the Dean campaign home page, and they deleted a post I wrote on the night of the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0">Dean Scream</a> that might have saved the campaign, but they were trying to make the story go away. As we know the story didn't go away. </p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/22/iWasAtDeanHqTheNightTheyDi.html">2008</a>: "The campaign had video that showed clearly that the press was actively trying to kill his candidacy. They had a website, and they had enough money to pay for the bandwidth to run it. They knew what the press was trying to do. They could have fought it. But they didn't."</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/12/15/deanForAmericaBumperSticker.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">That night I became friends with Nicco Mele, he was the webmaster at Dean who <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/itsAWrap.html#remindsMeOfAStory">gave</a> me the power. I was in their Burlington headquarters at the moment the whole thing imploded, the night of the Iowa caucus. I've also become friends with Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for Dean in 2008. They probably accelerated the adoption of online media in American politics by a decade or more. However, a lot of the ideas from that time are gone, but hopefully not forever.</p>
<p>The biggest idea was that it gave people a sense of belonging, that they weren't powerless to influence or even control the US government. We all felt that the war in Iraq was wrong, Dean gave Americans a way to say that clearly, with their own actions. I think if we want to achieve our destiny in the 2024 election, we need to get some of that into the campaign, or democracy won't prevail.</p>
<p>There's a story about how Trump makes people feel like they belong in <a href="https://wapo.st/3U224ud">the Washington Post</a> written by Philip Bump that Joe and Nicco should read if they haven't. This is something Trump gets that the Democrats have forgotten they know. People don't vote on policy, they vote to belong to something they believe might fix things, whatever that means to them.</p>
<p>PS: I also blogged about my adventure at the Dean campaign headquarters in <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01.html">January 2004</a> <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2004/01/18.html">before</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html#When:9:56:50AM">and</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html">during</a> the Iowa caucus and the Dean campaign implosion.  </p>
<p>PPS: A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407155545/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/jim/2004/01/19#a418">picture</a> of the blogging room in Burlington the night of the Iowa caucus in 2004.</p>
<p>PPPS: In February 2004, I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html">piece</a> summing up what we learned from Dean. "In a virtual sense, the Internet was looking for a candidate, and Howard Dean fit the bill. He was bloggable."</p>

## Tesla's New Supply Chain Woes

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>An “Arctic outbreak” will bring bitter cold to much of the U.S. this weekend • 109 weather stations in China have broken mid-January heat records • Nearly <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dbed27a9ef&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a quarter of humanity</a> now lives in drought conditions. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Red Sea tensions hit Tesla Berlin factory</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Tesla will suspend operations at its Berlin gigafactory for two weeks – from January 29 through February 11 – due to supply chain problems caused by the escalating tensions in the Red Sea, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=db5561a901&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who support Hamas in its conflict with Israel have been attacking vessels in the region, disrupting trade in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes. “Tesla is the first company to disclose a resulting interruption to output,” <em>Reuters</em> noted. Other companies, including Ikea and China’s Geely, have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0679e20258&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hinted at</a> possible delivery delays. On Thursday a U.S.-led coalition launched strikes against the militants in Yemen. President Biden <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3ab14f6439&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he “will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”
</p><h3>2. Hertz suggests its EV rentals are in more accidents than gas guzzlers</h3><p>
	Car-rental company Hertz is making a “dramatic about-face” on electric vehicles, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e58847caef&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a><em> Bloomberg Green</em>. The firm will sell off 20,000 EVs – about a third of its EV fleet – and use the money to buy gas-powered cars. One analyst <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=49974df18e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> the sell-off could boost Hertz’s cashflow by up to $300 million over the next year or so. The company has given several reasons for the move:
</p><ul>
<li>Lack of demand from customers</li>
<li>Unexpected loss in resale value due to Tesla’s steep price cuts (most of the vehicles in Hertz’s EV fleet are Teslas)</li>
<li><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2226261793&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Increased collisions</a> and higher repair costs</li>

	Why more accidents? Perhaps customers who rent EVs don’t understand how the driving experience differs from that of a gasoline vehicle, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5dda1206b4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posited</a> Stephen Scherr, Hertz’s chief executive. EVs are much heavier, after all, and they accelerate more quickly. While <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bd1d77717d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some schools</a> are starting to incorporate EVs into their driver’s ed courses, a small learning curve still exists for most Americans, and a road trip probably isn’t the best time to confront it.
</p><p>
	Hertz says it isn’t abandoning EVs entirely, but wants to let the market develop. The upshot for anyone looking to buy a cheap EV is that “now would be a really good time to pop over to Hertz’s sales page and start browsing,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1860725c4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Andrew J. Hawkins at <em>The Verge</em>. Tesla Model 3s are going for as little as $20,000.

The initiatives on the chopping block include clean transportation, forest maintenance, watershed resilience, and coastal protection. The state’s Extreme Heat and Community Resilience Program would be trimmed by $40.1 million, and wildfire reduction programs could see $100.7 million in cuts. Environmentalists lamented the news; Newsom’s office insisted the state’s climate goals were still a priority, noting that more than $10 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act will help soften the blow.</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p><em>

Natural gas investments on the rise </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Global investment in natural gas infrastructure is growing even as green energy pledges mount and renewable technologies gain momentum, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0fbe380b02&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> Gavin Maguire at <em>Reuters</em>, citing data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM). Natural gas is a fossil fuel energy source, albeit one the International Energy Agency <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=be721e7562&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> emits less carbon than other sources. Many see it as a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=afccd1019a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“bridge fuel”</a> in the clean energy transition. More than $720 billion is slated to go toward building natural gas pipelines worldwide, and another $190 billion will fund import facilities, according to GEM. “Once completed, the pipelines and LNG import terminals will extend the use of natural gas for years to come, and guarantee that fossil fuels will retain a critical role in key power systems well beyond 2030,” Maguire said.</p><h3>5. The case for naming heatwaves</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6b2b8b974a&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">report</a> from Australian nonprofit Renew suggests countries take a lesson from the Spanish city of Seville, which began naming heatwaves in 2022 to create a “heat culture” in which the public is more aware of and prepared for looming dangerous temperatures. “Naming heatwaves is about letting people know that this is a serious issue,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=69e28c39b8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Rob McLeod, a policy manager at Renew and author of the report. His recommendation is targeted mainly at Australia, but could be applied to many other regions where climate change is making extreme heatwaves more common.

Zyns are filled with nicotine and are meant to be placed under your lip like tobacco dip. No spitting is required, so nicotine pouches are even less visible than vaping.

## How far will an additional $40 a month go?

date: 2024-01-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A new Summer EBT program that provides an extra $40 per month per kid per month will feed millions of children over summer vacation. But with grocery prices high and still rising, that money can only go so far. Also on the show: The shockwaves of war in the Middle East expand, and the economy remains on the minds of Taiwanese voters.</p>

## P&B: Rachel Smith

date: 2024-01-12, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is the 20th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Rachel Smith and her blog, <a href="https://rachsmith.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">rachsmith.com</a></p>
<p>Rachel is an Australian developer, working at CodePen and she's been suggested by three of the previous guests so I had to get her on P&amp;B.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I'm Rach, a 37 year old from Australia. I'm a mum to two little ones and I work as a developer at CodePen. </p>
<p>I always loved computers as a kid and the internet as a teen, but I struggled to find a place for me until I discovered front-end development as a profession in 2011.</p>
<p>I spent the first half of my career working in digital advertising, allowing me to live abroad working for agencies in the UK and USA, and the second half working on a single product (CodePen). Working for CodePen has allowed me to expand my skills far beyond the front end, and now I do a bit of everything.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>This is actually somewhere around the seventh attempt at keeping a blog. I had two LiveJournals and a Blogspot as a teen. Since I started my career as a developer I've had maybe three different self-hosted blogs, that I tore down and started again, as well as a now-defunct CodePen blog that had code-tutorial style posts. This iteration is the one that has stuck the longest.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Something that has been really helpful with my blog was actually to stop thinking about it in terms of a "blog", and more of a "digital garden". I can default to perfectionistic thinking if I'm not careful, and I used to treat blog posts like a finished piece that needed to be polished until it was just right before publishing. By changing my "blog posts" to "notes", it changes the way I think about writing them and gets me to publish far more often.</p>
<p>I do all of my writing in an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> vault. It keeps my personal notes as well as the published ones. When I want to publish a note I run a script that copies the note content to the directory holding my website's content.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Before having kids, I could be quite precious about needing a specific environment to get any work done. Now, it is certainly nice to be able to write in a peaceful setting, but I'm also able to do it from anywhere - on the phone in my car, at the kitchen bench with Paw Patrol playing in the background. </p>
<p>One thing I will say is by far the biggest environmental factor that influences my creativity is how much I am on my phone. If I'm on my phone consuming all the time, there is no space for having thoughts about what to write. If I put the phone away, the ideas arrive.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I write all my posts in Markdown and use <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> to publish them on the web. All the content is kept in a GitHub repository with the site's code. The site is hosted for free with Netlify.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>If I were to do it all again, I think I would make an effort to save more of the old posts I had on previous versions of this blog. I'm like the opposite of a hoarder - I think nothing of tossing things away as I love the idea of a fresh start. But sometimes I think it would be nice to go back and read what I wrote 10 years ago.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>All I have to pay for in the running of my blog is the analytics (Plausible) and the domain registration.</p>
<p>I've had a couple of ad networks offer to place ads on my blog but I've always turned them down. My audience is quite small, but very engaged and loyal. Annoying my regular readers wouldn't be worth the small amount income I'd make from an attempt at monetisation.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I love reading blogs via RSS and am subscribed to about 30 personal blog feeds, including many of the people you've featured in this series already, so it is hard to choose favourites. I intend to add a blogroll to my site soon. </p>
<p>Speaking of blogrolls, I would suggest you interview <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/">Stefan Judis</a>. His website is goals.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>If you desire to write on your own blog but something is holding you back I would say: don't make assumptions about what people will or won't find interesting or useful. Every time I think I'm sharing something "too niche" I am surprised at the interest from readers.</p></div>

## Tesla puts the brakes on German production over Red Sea attacks

date: 2024-01-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tesla is suspending manufacturing at its only European electric car factory as attacks in the Red Sea disrupt supplies. The company said longer delivery times created a gap in its supply chains as shipping companies avoid the route. And as Taiwan prepares to go the polls, its tense relationship with Beijing dominates campaigns — yet for many residents, the economy is among the biggest issues.</p>

## On IoT Devices and Software Liability

date: 2024-01-12, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New law journal <a href="https://ejlt.org/index.php/ejlt/article/view/934/1078">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party Cyberattack Victims</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>

## ‘It’s Really Terrifyingly Good Satire’: A New Mexico Passive Home Builder on Showtime’s ‘The Curse’

date: 2024-01-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA0OTI5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTI3ODc2OX0.hrPKSbdsTsfCPdX5odqYqeuIGZV9aY0D4ijrhwpI4dM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Edie Dillman lives in the
	<a href="https://trendmagazineglobal.com/when-passive-is-powerful/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> first certified passive house in New Mexico</a>. She and her architect husband, Jonah Stanford, are founders of a company called B.Public Prefab that builds and supplies prefabricated panels for highly energy efficient homes.
</p><p>
	So when 
	<em>The Curse</em> began to air on Showtime this past fall, following an aspiring HGTV host couple Asher and Whitney Siegel, played by Canadian awkwardness spelunker and conceptual comic Nathan Fielder alongside America’s sweetheart Emma Stone, who are trying to get their show, “Flipanthropy” — during which they build and sell passive homes in Española, a town half an hour north of Santa Fe — picked up by the network, Dillman and her husband found out about it.
</p><p>
	“I was aware the second it launched,” Dillman told me. “There’s some very obvious correlations of a husband and wife team doing passive homes in northern New Mexico, for sure. So people started texting saying, ‘are you watching this? This is horribly painful.’ They were right.”
</p><p>
	The show plumbs new depths of discomfort for Fielder, who before this was best known for his conceptual reality shows 
	<em>Nathan For You</em> and <em>The Rehearsal</em>. <em>The Curse</em> opens with a producer dabbing the eyes of an elderly woman dying of cancer with water and even blowing menthol on them to get her to cry when the Siegels offer her son a job at the upscale coffee shop they’ve brought into town. And it only gets more uncomfortable from there: Asher takes a $100 bill away from a young girl after giving it to her on camera and spills a Powerade on a former coworker in order to steal from his computer; the poor little girl’s father, meanwhile, goes through what might be the most uncomfortable chiropractor appointment of all time (some viewers thought he had died), courtesy of Whitney.
</p><p>
	Dillman seemed good-natured about the whole thing, even acknowledging that “any press is good press” and that the show was probably the most media attention the passive house community has ever gotten.
</p><p>
	She was also refreshingly forthright about her own position — literally. “I think it's fair to tell you, as a journalist writing about this, I'm sitting in my own home that is a certified passive house and has the plaque that is almost identical to the plaque they have in the show, so it's a little too close to home,” she said. “Be kind in your reporting.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The Curse</em> is not a broadside against the passive house movement, which began in Germany in the 1980s and is based on using advanced building techniques — namely lots of insulation and thick windows that eliminate “<a href="https://blog.passivehouse-international.org/what-is-a-thermal-bridge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thermal bridging</a>,” where big differences in temperature create air flows that lead to inefficient air loss — to minimize the amount of energy needed to heat and cool a home. The target of the show is more the narcissism of do-gooders, how publicly virtuous behavior can mask and enable private avarice (the couple at the center of the show have an ultimate plan to goose the value of property they own in the town; Stone’s character is also the daughter of notorious Santa Fe slum lords) and how reality TV warps everything it touches.
</p><p>
	But the vehicle 
	<em>The Curse</em> chooses for its narcissistic, selfish, and emotionally damaged protagonists is nevertheless an oddly specific one. Not only have Whitney and Asher explicitly ripped off the design of their passive homes from artist Doug Aitken, whose designs famously feature mirrored exteriors, there’s even a German character clearly based on Passive House founder Wolfgang Feist who is brought in to explain the principles of passive homes.
</p><p>
	The show does correctly identify some of the precise anxieties of the passive house movement. Any number of FAQs and guides to passive houses address the exact issues that come up in 
	<em>The Curse</em>, such as whether you can open windows and doors or<a href="https://blog.passivehouse-international.org/summer-comfort-passive-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> how homes are cooled in hot weather</a>.
</p><p>
	One buyer on the show tosses out an induction stove because he wants to be able to stir-fry, while in perhaps the series’s cringiest scene, another prospective buyer couple pulls out of a deal in part because of how long it takes for their prospective home to cool when a door is opened. The male half of the couple is already sweating when he enters the house and almost immediately asks for a glass of water. While trying to air himself out, he asks if there’s enough wattage for some air conditioning units.</p><p>
	“The answer to that is you don’t need one,” Whitney says, explaining that because the home “functions like a thermos,” it will never go below 65 degrees Fahrenheit or above 78.
</p><p>
	“But 78 is sweltering,” the man says, before Whitney and Asher explain that because they had opened the door, it will take five to seven 
	<em>hours</em> for the temperature to adjust.
</p><p>
	The scene, Dillman said, “was a really funny exaggeration, and what's painful is we often use the thermos analogy.”
</p><p>
	But, she told me in a follow-up email, “I just want to say that opening doors and windows does not create hours of discomfort. My teenagers were horrified by that scene, as they have lived in a passive house for 12 years and have never experienced anything like that.”
</p><p>
	Dillman noted that passive homes 
	<em>can</em> have air conditioning and gas ranges, although for maximum carbon reduction and air quality, electrified cooking is best. The way the show depicts perfectionism, meanwhile, is “rightly satirized,” she said. Still, the idea of “a perfect home that you can't open windows and doors,” was “really damaging and inaccurate — funny, but inaccurate.”
</p><p>
	Dillman said few of the projects her company works on actually clear the passive house certification bar. “People are interested in the benefits, but not necessarily the gold star,” she told me.
	</p><p>
	Those benefits and how they’re achieved are explained at great length in 
	<em>The Curse</em> — to the point that the third main character, an unctuous reality TV producer Dougie played by Benny Safdie, just about loses it. “This shit sucks, alright,” he says. “And it’s boring — really boring. I’m watching a guy talk about air for four minutes.”</p><p>
	But 
	<em>The Curse</em> also milks drama from some of the thornier facets of the passive house movement, especially where it intersects with politics. When the couple drops out of buying the sweltering home, Asher calls another prospective buyer, who rolls up in a pickup truck sporting a pro-cop Blue Lives Matter decal. He loves the home — other “eco” homes he’s looked at “don’t even consider” thermal bridging, and he “love[s] that they’re basically off the grid.”
</p><p>
	Instead of accepting that sustainable building practices can be appealing to people besides liberal do-gooders, Whitney — whose own goals of getting “Flipanthropy” picked up by HGTV, increasing the value of the real estate she and her husband own, and, most importantly, getting people to like and respect her are only glancingly associated with sustainability per se — goes near-catatonic with Asher.
</p><p>
	“I actually loved that,” Dillman said. While she acknowledged that the stereotypical buyer of a passive home is a “white, liberal, do-gooder sustainability nut,” she also recognized that the energy independence a passive house offers might just as obviously appeal across the political spectrum. “It’s where the right and left somewhat come together and really agree,” Dillman told me.
</p><p>
	While some of the downsides of passive home construction depicted on 
	<em>The Curse</em> were “super inaccurate,” Dillman said, “I think seeing the humor in it and the morality is important.”
</p><p>
	“I mean,” she added, “it’s really terrifyingly good satire.”

## US, Britain Blast Houthi Targets in Yemen, Killing at Least 5 Fighters

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

the pentagon — The United States, Britain and a handful of other allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s capabilities.


U.S. Central Command late Thursday said the series of strikes hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.


"We hit them pretty hard, pretty good," a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.


A spokesperson for the Houthi rebel group said the strikes killed at least five fighters and wounded six others, without specifying the targets that were hit.


The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets, surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.


The U.S. alone, dropped more than 100 precision guided munitions on the Houthi installations, officials said, with the naval vessels and submarines firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out the intended targets.


The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.




In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden called the strikes a "direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks" on international shipping, saying they were necessary after attempts at diplomacy were ignored.


"These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes," Biden said. "I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary."


British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.


"Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen," Sunak said in a statement. "This cannot stand."


It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following Hamas' assault on Israel on October 7.


U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the damage to Houthi capabilities is "significant."


"We were going after very specific capability in very specific locations with precision munitions," said a senior U.S. military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the operation.


"This was a significant action," added a senior U.S. administration official. "[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent weeks."


There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.


U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial ship full of jet fuel.


The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or damage.


On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.


U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.


The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.


Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S. officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described as reckless and illegal behavior.


"There will be consequences," Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.




"The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree. And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity," he said.


Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea continued.


"Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews," the statement said.


Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan.


The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.


Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden.


The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week called it "the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea in years."


The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday, calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.


There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do anything to deter Tehran.


"Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground," the former commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth "Frank" McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.


"They're choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a very low, very low price for Iran," he said.


But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.


"I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe it stays in Yemen," he said. "And I believe Iran will leave their partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate."


U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than disinformation.


This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen's Red Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi's ability to track and target ships.

## China, Russia Trade Soared In 2023 As Commerce with US Sank

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — Trade between China and Russia hit a record high in 2023, official data from Beijing showed on Friday, as commerce with the United States fell for the first time in four years on the back of geopolitical tensions.


China-Russia trade reached more than $240 billion, customs figures showed, overshooting a goal of $200 billion set by the neighbors in bilateral meetings last year.


The figure is a record for the two countries, who have grown closer politically and economically since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.


Beijing has drawn criticism from Western countries for its stance on the Ukraine war, on which China insists it is neutral.


It has refused to criticize Moscow's invasion.


The trade figures represented a year-on-year increase of 26.3%, according to the data.


In contrast, trade between the U.S. and China fell for the first time since 2019.


Commerce with the United States was valued at $664 billion last year, down 11.6% from 2022.


Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, told a news conference that the country's trade would face more hurdles in 2024.


"The complexity, severity and uncertainty of the external environment are on the rise, and we need to overcome the difficulties and make more efforts to further promote the growth of foreign trade," he said.


The figures also showed China's exports fell 4.6% over the year, the first retreat since 2016, while imports were down 5.5%.


Friday also saw gloomy economic figures on the domestic front, with data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showing deflation in China continued for the third straight month in December.


The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% on-year.


China slipped into deflation in July for the first time since 2021 and following a brief rebound the following month, prices have been in constant decline since September.


Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a drop of 0.4% last month, having sunk 0.5% in November.


While deflation suggests goods were cheaper, it poses a threat to the broader economy as consumers tend to postpone purchases, hoping for further reductions.


A lack of demand can then force companies to cut production, freeze hiring or lay off workers, while potentially also having to discount existing stocks -- dampening profitability even as costs remain the same.


By way of comparison, inflation in the United States stood at 3.4% in December.


Inflation in China for the whole of 2023 rose by an average of 0.2%, in contrast to other major economies, which saw prices soar once again.


The NBS also said producer prices sank 2.7%, the 15th consecutive month of declines.


The PPI index, which measures the cost of goods leaving factories and provides an insight into the health of the economy, fell 3% in November.

## US, Britain Blast Dozens of Houthi Targets in Yemen in Retaliatory Strikes

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

the pentagon — The United States, Britain and a handful of other allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s capabilities.


U.S. Central Command late Thursday said the series of strikes hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.


"We hit them pretty hard, pretty good," a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.


The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets, surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.


The U.S. alone, dropped more than 100 precision guided munitions on the Houthi installations, officials said, with the naval vessels and submarines firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out the intended targets.


The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.




In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden called the strikes a "direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks" on international shipping, saying they were necessary after attempts at diplomacy were ignored.


"These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes," Biden said. "I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary."


British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.


"Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen," Sunak said in a statement. "This cannot stand."


It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following Hamas' assault on Israel on October 7.


U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the damage to Houthi capabilities is "significant."


"We were going after very specific capability in very specific locations with precision munitions," said a senior U.S. military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the operation.


"This was a significant action," added a senior U.S. administration official. "[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent weeks."


There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.


U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial ship full of jet fuel.


The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or damage.


On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.


U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.


The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.


Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S. officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described as reckless and illegal behavior.


"There will be consequences," Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.


"The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree. And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity," he said.


Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea continued.


"Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews," the statement said.


Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan.


The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.


Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden.


The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week called it "the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea in years."


The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday, calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.


There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do anything to deter Tehran.


"Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground," the former commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth "Frank" McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.


"They're choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a very low, very low price for Iran," he said.


But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.


"I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe it stays in Yemen," he said. "And I believe Iran will leave their partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate."


U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than disinformation.


This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen's Red Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi's ability to track and target ships.

## Cold Spell Hits Northwest US; Storm Forecast Cancels Flights, Classes Across Nation

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Ore. — Tyrone McDougald wore a long-eared, leopard-print hat as he sorted through racks of warm clothes at a homeless service center in Portland, Oregon. He was already wearing multiple layers, but with no roof of his own, he grabbed two more coats to help him face a bitter cold snap arriving in the Northwest.


"I'm hoping that I can get in a shelter," he said. "That would relieve a lot of the burden."


An approaching storm was expected to deliver snow to Portland, a city more accustomed to winter rain, by Saturday. It's one of a number of sprawling storms bringing everything from what the National Weather Service called "life-threatening wind chills" in South Dakota to the possibility of tornadoes in the South.


School and flights were canceled in advance in parts of the South and Midwest. Republican candidates campaigning ahead of Monday's Iowa caucuses were contending with a blizzard warning covering most of the state, and Nikki Haley's campaign canceled three Friday events and said it would be hosting "telephone town halls."


Advocates were particularly worried about homeless people as well as older residents who might be snowed or iced in, especially in the Pacific Northwest, where the winters are typically mild.


In one hour Thursday, during the lunch service at Blanchet House, a homeless services nonprofit in Portland, about 165 warm clothing items were claimed — including the coats McDougald grabbed.


Julie Showers, the nonprofit's spokesperson, said people were desperate for dry clothes and shoes after days of cold rain.


"We worry about frostbite, hypothermia," she said. "There are a lot of people experiencing homelessness in Portland that are in mental health crisis ... and slowly become hypothermic laying on the street because they don't understand how cold it's getting."




McDougald said he's spent the past two years unhoused: "I'm hoping I don't have to do another whole winter out here."


In the Chicago area, which could see more than 15 centimeters of snow by Saturday, advocates also worried for the growing population of migrants sent up from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds are staying in eight parked "warming buses" to avoid sleeping outside while they await space in city-run shelters.


Among them was Angelo Travieso, a Venezuelan bused up from Texas. He wore a light jacket and sandals with socks.


"I slept sitting because there is almost no space left," he said. "The buses are also small and you practically have to stay inside because of the heating, because it is deadly cold outside."


In Portland and Seattle, temperature highs were expected to hover around zero to -3.3 Celsius and lows in the low 20s and about -5 C to -7.7 C from Friday through at least Monday.


The homelessness agency in King County, home to Seattle, activated its highest tier of severe weather operations through at least Tuesday, working with cities to open 24/7 shelters and with transit partners to provide transportation to shelters.


Seattle City Hall served as a shelter for up to 40 people Thursday night.


Multnomah County, home to Portland, provided outreach groups earlier in the week with clothing and cold weather supplies to distribute to people living outside, including wool blankets, tarps, tents and sleeping bags, said spokesperson Denis Theriault.


Cold spells in the past have been deadly for Portland's homeless population. Two people died of cold in 2022, an annual county report on homeless deaths found. That was down from eight deaths from hypothermia in 2021 — the same year four people also died of overheating during the unprecedented and devastating "heat dome" that saw temperatures soar to an all-time high of 46.7 Celsius in Portland and smashed heat records across the region. The heat wave killed hundreds across Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.


Portland winters do not include regular or extended periods of snow, so the city's transportation department only salts or de-ices about a third of the street grid.


Past snow and ice storms have effectively paralyzed the city, including in 2017 and in 2021, when freezing rain coated roads in dangerous ice and many ice-laden trees snapped and fell on power lines, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people.


Last February, nearly 28 centimeters fell in what amounted to the second snowiest day in the city's history, taking drivers by surprise and stranding them on freeways for hours.


Norman Chusid, owner of the Ankeny Hardware in southeast Portland, said he had to keep his store open two hours past closing on Wednesday to serve all the customers. The store has been selling 3 to 5 tons of ice melt every day, he said.


"Snow shovels have been going like crazy," he said.


At higher elevations, heavy snow, high winds and whiteout conditions were expected to envelop the Cascade Mountains and make travel "very difficult to impossible," the weather service said. Fresh snow already blanketed the Cascades earlier in the week.


An avalanche at a ski resort near Lake Tahoe in California on Wednesday swept up four people, killing one.


Outside a tent in Seattle's International District on Thursday, David Dodds said he had lots of experience in the cold: He'd been homeless in Alaska.


"During the cold snaps, maybe that'd be time to make a new friend or two," he said. "Two warm bodies under the same blanket will go a long ways. ... This cold, when temperature drops, it's no joke, and you can wind up dead."

## A 26 bit build of RISC OS

date: 2024-01-12, from: OS News

This is a Rom Image and hard disc image of RISC OS, built from the open ROOL sources, but compiled up in 26bit compatible mode. It mostly uses code from approx 2000-2002, compiled up with a set of contempory tools. It should be compatible with Acorn RiscPCs, A7000s, A7000+, and the emulator RPCEmu. ↫ Peter Howkins I&#8217;m not particularly well-versed in the world of RISC OS, but I think this build is targeting older machines that use 26bit ARM processors.

## GNU Hurd’s 64bit port progress, porting started to Aarch64, POWER9

date: 2024-01-12, from: OS News

While GNU Hurd predates the Linux kernel, its hardware support has been woefully behind with very limited and dated hardware support compared to modern PC/server hardware. Not only that, its been largely x86 limited but during Q4&#8217;2023 the developers involved have made progress on x86_64 support and begun tackling AArch64 porting. Developer Samuel Thibault shared that the GNU Hurd 64-bit port now has enough packages in the debian-ports archive to be able to bootstrap a chroot. A 64-bit Debian + GNU Hurd build daemon is getting setup and the other infrastructure work is coming along. ↫ Michael Larabel In addition, work has started to port Hurd to POWER9, and someone is working on bringing the Ladybird web browser to Hurd, for a more modern browsing experience, among many other points of progress.

## COSMIC: the road to alpha

date: 2024-01-12, from: OS News

Happy New Year, and welcome to 2024! We’re on the home stretch putting together COSMIC DE, the new desktop environment made for Pop!_OS and other distros. Basically, it’s the look, feel, and customizations. The goal for the COSMIC DE alpha is to feel like a complete product, albeit with features still to come. With a more stable alpha, we can better collect feedback on usability and focus on completing the Settings panels. From here, we can work towards an eventual 24.04 release over the summer. ↫ System76&#8217;s blog I&#8217;m very excited to try this out once it&#8217;s available.

## US, UK Strike Back at Several Houthi Sites in Yemen

date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — The United States and Britain have launched a massive attack against Iranian-backed Houthis inside Yemen in retaliation for more than two dozen recent attacks against vessels transiting international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.


A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said American and British military assets struck more than a dozen Houthi targets Thursday, ranging from radar systems and airfields to drone and missile storage sites.   




"We hit them pretty hard, pretty good," a U.S. defense official, likewise talking on the condition of anonymity, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.


The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets, surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.


The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.




In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden called the strikes a "direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks" on international shipping, saying they were necessary after attempts at diplomacy were ignored.


"These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes," Biden said. "I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary."


British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.


"Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen," Sunak said in a statement. "This cannot stand."


It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following Hamas' assault on Israel on October 7.


U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the damage to Houthi capabilities is "significant."


"We were going after very specific capability in very specific locations with precision munitions," said a senior U.S. military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the operation.


"This was a significant action," added a senior U.S. administration official. "[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent weeks."


There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.


U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial ship full of jet fuel.


The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or damage.


On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.


U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.


The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.


Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S. officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described as reckless and illegal behavior.


"There will be consequences," Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.


"The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree. And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity," he said.


Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea continued.


"Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews," the statement said.


Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan.


The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.


Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden.


The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week called it "the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea in years." 




The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday, calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.




There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do anything to deter Tehran.


"Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground," the former commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth "Frank" McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.


"They're choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a very low, very low price for Iran," he said.


But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.


"I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe it stays in Yemen," he said. "And I believe Iran will leave their partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate." 


U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than disinformation.


This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen's Red Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi's ability to track and target ships.


Ostap Yarysh with VOA's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.

## Dropout

date: 2024-01-12, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Have you heard about <a href="http://dropout.tv">Dropout</a>? Spun off from College Humor, Dropout is a paid streaming service with hours and hours of high quality improv content. For $6/month (less than half a Netflix) you get access to a large swath of independently produced shows that are a guaranteed laugh.</p>
<p>Here’s five shows I love on Dropout and chances are if you’re reading this, you’d like them too.</p>
<h2>Game Changer</h2>
<p>Game Changer is a game show where the contestants don’t know what game they’re playing until the show starts. The contestants are all College Humor talent and have comedy and improv skills in spades.</p>
<two-column>
<iframe width="315" height="560" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/clPG1_PZEd0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</two-column>
<p>The series has reached new heights in the last two seasons with even more ambitious games, including but not limited to: a <em>The Bachelor</em> clone, a <em>Survivor</em> clone, <a href="https://youtu.be/VbF1AJPqP1M">an improvised musical</a>, a surprise escape room, an improvised Shakespearean play, and many more.</p>
<h2>Make Some Noise</h2>
<p>A spin-off of Game Changer, this show is pure improv in the exact style of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” This is my favorite of all the shows. Pure, corny, improv games. There’s even an improv karaoke episode with Wayne Brady from the US version of <em>Whose Line</em> to tie up the head nod perfectly.</p>
<two-column>
<iframe width="315" height="560" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jsXhpxTq-3g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</two-column>
<p>Just when you think you’ve seen all the goofs to be goofed, newer cast members like Jake Wysocki and Vic Michaelis show up to inject new life and take it even further over the top.</p>
<h2>Play It By Ear</h2>
<p>Another Game Changer spin-off, Play It By Ear is a 30-minute five act improv musical. All you fellow thespians out there will love it.</p>
<two-column>
<iframe width="315" height="560" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfO6lBftOYY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</two-column>
<h2>Dimension 20</h2>
<p>Say hi, intrepid heroes! Dimension 20 is an “actual play” series where comedians play DnD. It’s got great set pieces, funny goofs and top tier DMs like Brennan Lee Mulligan and Aabria Iyengar. I started with Tiny Heist featuring the McElroy Brothers (and their dad) from The Adventure Zone podcast and would recommend that as a starting point, but they’re all fun and have different settings, stories, and players. I’m sure you can find one you like.</p>
<two-column>

</two-column>
<h2>Total Forgiveness</h2>
<p>Now for something completely different. Total Forgiveness is a show about how far two people would go to forgive their student loans. Grant and Ally subject each other to weekly dares that prey on each other’s fears and insecurities approaching Jackass levels of impropriety.</p>
<iframe height="315" width="560" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b9RoQvbKw7Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2>Supporting small production companies</h2>
<p>Production on new Dropout content stopped during to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Being web content, Dropout was technically exempt from the strike but decided to stand in solidarity with their writers and actors. That’s an admirable move for a small production company.</p>
<p>It’s fun to support smaller media ventures and Dropout feels like one of the chaotic good ones. You can even <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/checkout/subscribe/gift?code=dropoutfullyear&amp;plan=yearly">gift a subscription</a> to someone in your life who likes TTRPGs or improv comedy (or both). Highly recommend. There’s also a lot of free episodes on YouTube, so hopefully this post has already blessed your algorithm.</p>

## Tackling strong biofilm and multi-virulent vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus via natural alkaloid-based porous nanoparticles: perspective towards near future eradication

date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>As a growing direction, nano-based therapy has become a successful paradigm used to address the phytogenic delivery-related problems in overcoming multivirulent vancomycin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (VRSA) infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Hence, our aim was to develop and assess a novel nanocarrier system (mesoporous silica nanoparticles, MPS-NPs) for free berberine (Free-BR) as an antimicrobial alkaloid against strong biofilm-producing and multi-virulent VRSA strains using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Our outcomes demonstrated vancomycin resistance in 13.7% of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) strains categorized as VRSA. Notably, strong biofilm formation was observed in 69.2% of VRSA strains that were all positive for <italic>icaA</italic> gene. All strong biofilm-producing VRSA strains harbored a minimum of two virulence genes comprising <italic>clfA</italic> and <italic>icaA</italic> with 44.4% of them possessing all five virulence genes (<italic>icaA</italic>, <italic>tst</italic>, <italic>clfA</italic>, <italic>hla</italic>, and <italic>pvl</italic>), and 88.9% being multi-virulent. The study findings affirmed excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of BR-loaded MPS-NPs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay displayed the downregulating role of BR-loaded MPS-NPs on strong biofilm-producing and multi-virulent VRSA strains virulence and <italic>agr</italic> genes in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mice models. Additionally, BR-loaded MPS-NPs supplementation has a promising role in attenuating the upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines’ genes in VRSA-infected mice with attenuation in pro-apoptotic genes expression resulting in reduced VRSA-induced apoptosis. In essence, the current study recommends the future scope of using BR-loaded MPS-NPs as auspicious alternatives for antimicrobials with tremendous antimicrobial, antibiofilm, anti-quorum sensing (QS), and anti-virulence effectiveness against problematic strong biofilm-producing and multi-virulent VRSA-associated infections.</p></sec>

## Mucosal microbiome of surgically treated terminal ileal Crohn’s disease

date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Crohn’s disease (CD) is associated with changes in the microbiome. The role of these changes and their precise association with disease course and activity remain ambiguous. In this prospective single-center study, the mucosal microbiome of surgical CD and non-CD patients was compared at the time of surgery. Microbial analyses were individually performed for ileal and colonic tissue samples obtained during surgery using 16S-rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing. Three groups out of the 46 included patients were formed: 1) a study group of CD of patients who received ileocecal resection due to CD involvement (CD study, n=10); 2) a control group of non-CD of patients who received intestinal resection due to indications other than CD (non-CD control, n=27); and 3) a second control group of CD who underwent resection of the intestine not affected by CD (CD non-affected control, n=9). Species richness and Shannon diversity were not different between all formed groups and regions analyzed (p&gt;0.05). Several significant taxonomic differences were seen at the phylum-, order-, and genus-levels between the formed groups, such as a decrease of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (phylum-level) and an increase of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Escherichia/Shigella/Pseudescherichia</italic> (genus-level) in CD study – colon vs. the non-CD control – colon (p ≤ 0.05). The CD non-affected control presented the largest amount of differentially abundant taxa in comparison to the other groups. These results underline that CD is accompanied by changes in affected and non-affected intestinal regions compared to non-CD controls. This study contributes the mucosal microbiome of a well-defined subset of surgical CD patients without confounding aspects of the fecal microbiome or regional microbial differences to the existing literature.</p>

## Dissecting EXP2 sequence requirements for protein export in malaria parasites

<p>Apicomplexan parasites that reside within a parasitophorous vacuole harbor a conserved pore-forming protein that enables small-molecule transfer across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites that cause malaria, this nutrient pore is formed by EXP2 which can complement the function of GRA17, an orthologous protein in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic> EXP2, however, has an additional function in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, serving also as the pore-forming component of the protein export machinery PTEX. To examine how EXP2 can play this additional role, transgenes that encoded truncations of EXP2, GRA17, hybrid GRA17-EXP2, or EXP2 under the transcriptional control of different promoters were expressed in EXP2 knockdown parasites to determine which could complement EXP2 function. This revealed that EXP2 is a unique pore-forming protein, and its protein export role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cannot be complemented by <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA17. This was despite the addition of the EXP2 assembly strand and part of the linker helix to GRA17, which are regions necessary for the interaction of EXP2 with the other core PTEX components. This indicates that the body region of EXP2 plays a critical role in PTEX assembly and/or that the absence of other <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> leads to its reduced efficiency of insertion into the PVM and complementation potential. Altering the timing and abundance of EXP2 expression did not affect protein export but affected parasite viability, indicating that the unique transcriptional profile of EXP2 when compared to other PTEX components enables it to serve an additional role in nutrient exchange.</p>

## Characteristics of the gut microbiota of patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques positive for bacterial genetic material

date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>The gut microbiota (GM) is believed to be closely associated with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (SCAS), yet more evidence is needed to substantiate the significant role of GM in SCAS. This study, based on the detection of bacterial DNA in carotid plaques, explores the characteristics of GM in SCAS patients with plaque bacterial genetic material positivity, aiming to provide a reference for subsequent research.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We enrolled 27 healthy individuals (NHF group) and 23 SCAS patients (PFBS group). We utilized 16S rDNA V3-V4 region gene sequencing to analyze the microbiota in fecal samples from both groups, as well as in plaque samples from the carotid bifurcation extending to the origin of the internal carotid artery in all patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results indicate significant differences in the gut microbiota (GM) between SCAS patients and healthy individuals. The detection rate of bacterial DNA in plaque samples was approximately 26%. Compared to patients with negative plaques (PRSOPWNP group), those with positive plaques (PRSOPWPP group) exhibited significant alterations in their GM, particularly an upregulation of 11 bacterial genera (such as Klebsiella and Streptococcus) in the gut, which were also present in the plaques. In terms of microbial gene function prediction, pathways such as Fluorobenzoate degradation were significantly upregulated in the GM of patients with positive plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study is the first to identify significant alterations in the gut microbiota of patients with positive plaques, providing crucial microbial evidence for further exploration of the pathogenesis of SCAS.</p></sec>

## Comparative genomic analysis of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients and retail meat

date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a significant human pathogen that poses a threat to public health due to its association with foodborne contamination and a variety of infections. The factors contributing to the pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> include virulence, drug resistance, and toxin production, making it essential to monitor their prevalence and genetic profiles. This study investigated and compared the genomic characteristics of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from retail meat and patients in Saudi Arabia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 136 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were obtained between October 2021 and June 2022:84 from patients and 53 from meat samples in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were identified using conventional methods and MALDI-TOF MS, and methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) was identified using VITEK2 and BD Phoenix systems. MRSA was confirmed phenotypically using chromogenic agar, and genotypically by detecting <italic>mec</italic>A. Genomic data were analyzed using BactopiaV2 pipeline, local BLAST, and MLST databases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Antibiotic resistance genes were prevalent in both meat and patient <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, with high prevalence of <italic>tet</italic>38, <italic>bla</italic>Z, and <italic>fos</italic>B. Notably, all <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from patients carried multidrug-resistant (MDR) genes, and a high percentage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from meat also harbored MDR genes. Phenotypically, 43% of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from meat and 100% of the patients’ isolates were MDR. Enterotoxin genes, including <italic>sel</italic>X, <italic>sem</italic>, and <italic>sei</italic>, exhibited high compatibility between meat and patient <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates. Virulence genes such as <italic>cap, hly/hla, sbi</italic>, and <italic>isd</italic> were found in all <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from both sources.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study established a genetic connection between <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from meat and patients, showing shared antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. The presence of these genes in meat derived isolates underscores its role as a reservoir. Genomic relatedness also suggests potential transmission of resistance between different settings. These findings emphasize the necessity for a comprehensive approach to monitor and control <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections in both animals and humans.</p></sec>

## Functional characterization of Plasmodium vivax hexose transporter 1

date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> is the most widely distributed human malaria parasite. The eradication of vivax malaria remains challenging due to transmission of drug-resistant parasite and dormant liver form. Consequently, anti-malarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently demanded. Glucose uptake blocking strategy is suggested as a novel mode of action that leads to selective starvation in various species of malaria parasites. The role of hexose transporter 1 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species is glucose uptake, and its blocking strategies proved to successfully induce selective starvation. However, there is limited information on the glucose uptake properties via <italic>P. vivax</italic> hexose transporter 1 (PvHT1). Thus, we focused on the PvHT1 to precisely identify its properties of glucose uptake. The PvHT1 North Korean strain (PvHT1<sub>NK</sub>) expressed <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes mediating the transport of [<sup>3</sup>H] deoxy-D-glucose (ddGlu) in an expression and incubation time-dependent manner without sodium dependency. Moreover, the PvHT1<sub>NK</sub> showed no exchange mode of glucose in efflux experiments and concentration-dependent results showed saturable kinetics following the Michaelis-Menten equation. Non-linear regression analysis revealed a Km value of 294.1 μM and a Vmax value of 1,060 pmol/oocyte/hr, and inhibition experiments showed a strong inhibitory effect by glucose, mannose, and ddGlu. Additionally, weak inhibition was observed with fructose and galactose. Comparison of amino acid sequence and tertiary structure between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> HT1 revealed a completely conserved residue in glucose binding pocket. This result supported that the glucose uptake properties are similar to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and PfHT1 inhibitor (compound 3361) works in <italic>P. vivax</italic>. These findings provide properties of glucose uptake via PvHT1<sub>NK</sub> for carbohydrate metabolism and support the approaches to vivax malaria drug development strategy targeting the PvHT1 for starving of the parasite.</p>

## US Lawmakers Question Whether Aid Is Benefiting Taliban

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. officials overseeing assistance to Afghanistan told U.S. lawmakers Thursday that aid is rigorously monitored to prevent financial benefits from reaching the Taliban.


"We remain extremely vigilant against attempts to divert and interfere with assistance delivery. USAID takes its duty as a steward of U.S. taxpayer dollars extremely seriously, and we hold implementing partners to the highest standards," said Michael Schiffer, assistant administrator, Bureau for Asia, U.S. Agency for International Development.


Assurances from the U.S. State Department and USAID came after the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a January 8 letter that there were still unanswered questions about $3.5 billion in funds controlled by the Switzerland-based Afghan Fund.


SIGAR told Congress that more than a year after the Afghan Fund's creation it had not made any disbursements for its intended purpose of benefiting the Afghan people.


According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, "an estimated 23.7 million people — more than half of Afghanistan's population — will require humanitarian assistance to survive in 2024."


The Taliban took back control of Afghanistan in August 2021 following the chaotic U.S. evacuation of Kabul that ended the 20-year conflict. The United States has provided more than $2 billion in aid since that takeover.


"The Taliban is benefiting more than ever from U.S. taxpayer dollars," said Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "They steal from NGOs to enrich their fighters and to solidify their power."


McCaul said the Taliban demand payoffs from NGOs, create fake NGOs to receive aid money and embed Taliban officials within U.N. agencies.


An October 2023 SIGAR report found evidence of that infiltration, leading to lawmaker concerns about potential corruption in the Afghan Fund.


McCaul said Thursday that SIGAR has 30 outstanding requests awaiting an answer from the State Department regarding the disbursement of aid in Afghanistan.


Thomas West, special representative for Afghanistan and deputy assistant secretary, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs at the U.S. State Department, told the House panel that the State Department has spent more than 13,000 hours cooperating with SIGAR on its requests about aid oversight.

## Joe Manchin Will Help You Sue the Biden Administration

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA2MDY1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTMyMzg1Mn0.yramWa_F7ANyHbQunEktY9euLS8xaHS10NHg0UywKEU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>It’s not often you hear a sitting U.S. senator invite the public to sue the federal government — especially when the president is a member of their own party. But most sitting senators aren’t Joe Manchin.</p><p>Manchin continued his <a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-treasury-ev-tax-credit-guidance" target="_blank">crusade</a> against the Biden administration’s implementation of the electric vehicle subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act on Thursday in a hearing of the Senate Natural Resources Committee to discuss the EV supply chain. Since the law’s passage, the Democrat from West Virginia has become <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4337855-joe-manchin-blasts-biden-administration-electric-vehicle-rule-foreign-parts-exceptions/" target="_blank">obsessed</a> with the idea that President Biden is trying to weaken rules around domestic content in order to allow more EVs to qualify for subsidies and therefore speed adoption. </p><p>The law requires that the final assembly of EVs — as well as the manufacture and processing of their components and critical minerals — be done largely in the United States or any of its free trade partners to qualify for subsidies.</p><p>Though the timelines for compliance are spelled out in the law, the Treasury Department has been tasked with releasing guidance to clarify certain aspects of the rules. For example, over the past year, the department has proposed interpretations of what exactly is considered a “battery component” and under what circumstances a component or mineral will be considered to have been produced by a “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">foreign entity of concern</a>,” like China. Though those may both sound like straightforward questions, the guidance clarifies myriad gray areas, such as what happens when a U.S. company licenses Chinese technology.</p><p>But at the hearing on Thursday, Manchin used his opening remarks to accuse Treasury officials of extending timelines for compliance with certain aspects of the law and watering down domestic content requirements.</p><p>“The administration is delaying deadlines we wrote into the law to remove China completely from the battery supply chain,” he said. “Vehicles that contain battery minerals and components from China and other adversaries can qualify for years longer than the law allows.”</p><p>Manchin warned that the administration’s “unlawful rules are bound to get struck down in court.” He then vowed to “support any entity that goes to court to correct the illegal liberalization of this law with an amicus brief.”</p><p>It’s true that the Treasury has taken some liberties. For one, it has proposed temporarily exempting certain minerals that are currently very hard to trace from the foreign entity of concern rules. But during the hearing, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyomo maintained that the rules were strict. He noted that the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">list of electric vehicles</a> that are eligible for the federal tax credit has shrunk from more than 40 when the IRA was signed into law down to just 13 as of the beginning of this year. </p><p>Automakers have largely supported Treasury’s rulemaking. For example, the lobbying group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/blog/foreign_entity_of_concern_finally_some_clarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcomed the clarity</a> provided by the proposed foreign entity of concern rules in December, saying that they struck a “pragmatic balance.” Autos Drive America, another trade group that represents foreign automakers operating in the country, also <a href="https://www.autosdriveamerica.org/posts/press-release/statement-feoc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reacted positively</a>. </p><p>Adeyomo testified that automakers have told Treasury the rules are tough but achievable. In response to a question about the need to deploy more electric vehicle chargers, he also noted that the administration will be releasing guidance on a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/alternative-fuel-vehicle-refueling-property-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tax credit for charging stations</a> in the coming weeks.</p><p>To be clear: Manchin maintained that he was proud of passing the IRA and stood by its goals. His problem wasn’t with EVs, but rather that the Biden administration was “willing to bend and break the law” to implement its “radical climate agenda.” </p><p>Republicans, meanwhile, used the hearing to raise concerns broader about the risks EVs pose to the electric grid. Senator John Barasso of Wyoming cited a <a href="https://www.nerc.com/news/Headlines%20DL/2023%20LTRA%20Media%20Release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent report</a> that warned of waning supply reliability over the next decade due to a sharp rise in demand caused in part by electric vehicles, as well as the retirement of fossil fuel generators.</p><p>But David Turk, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, responded that EVs can actually be a solution for the grid because they add new energy storage capacity and are a flexible source of demand. “The fact that we're going to have a whole bunch more batteries out there, that we can determine when those batteries are charged,” he said, “that's actually going to be a more resilient grid if we incorporate that.”</p><p>This is unlikely to be the last we hear from Manchin about the EV tax credit. In December, he <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchin-opens-new-front-in-war-on-biden-ev-policies/" target="_blank">asked</a> the Government Accountability Office to issue a legal opinion on whether Congress could overturn the Treasury’s guidance under the Congressional Review Act.</p>

## ASUS’ new graphics cards and motherboards replace 12VHPWR connector with a 600W PCIe

date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News

At CES 2024, ASUS unveiled a new standard for motherboards, graphics cards, and cases. Called BTF (short for Back-to-The-Future), it offers much cleaner cable management with power connectors at the back of a motherboard. More importantly, it fully ditches the ill-fated 12VHPWR plug in favor of a much tidier (and probably safer) 600W PCIe connector. ASUS claims computers with BTF components are easier to assemble since all plugs and connectors are located at the back side of the motherboard tray without other components obstructing access to power, SATA, USB, IO, and other connectors. Therefore, &#8220;you won&#8217;t have to reach as far into the depth of your chassis to plug things in.&#8221; BTF should also make cable management much more elegant, resulting in a tidy, showcase-ready build. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin The interior of PCs effectively hasn&#8217;t changed since the &#8217;80s, and it feels like it, too. Many of the connectors and plugs are unwieldy, in terrible places, hard to connect/disconnect, difficult to route, and so on. A lot more needs to be done than putting the connectors on the back of the motherboard and integrating GPU power delivery into the PCIe slot, but even baby steps like these are downright revolutionary in the conservative, change-averse, anti-user world of PC building. I don&#8217;t say this very often, but basically, look at the last Intel Mac Pro. That&#8217;s what a modern PC should look and work like inside.

## US FAA Investigating Boeing 737 Max 9 After Mid-Air Panel Incident

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a formal investigation into the Boeing 737 Max 9 after a cabin panel blew off an Alaska Airlines ALK.N flight while in mid-air last week, forcing an emergency landing, the regulator said Thursday. 


The FAA grounded 171 Boeing jets installed with the same panel after the landing, most of which are operated by U.S. carriers Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, pending safety inspections.  


It is still unclear when the planes will be cleared to fly again, and the incident is the latest in a series of events that have shaken the industry's confidence in the aircraft manufacturer. 


The FAA said the Alaska Airlines Max 9 incident "should have never happened and it cannot happen again." It told Boeing of the investigation in a letter on Wednesday "to determine if Boeing failed to ensure completed products conformed to its approved design and were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations" and after learning of "additional discrepancies."  


"We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and the NTSB on their investigations," Boeing said in a statement about the investigation.  


Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down 1.2% on Thursday. 


Both Alaska and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on multiple grounded aircraft during preliminary checks, raising new concerns about how Boeing's best-selling jet family is manufactured. The two carriers have canceled numerous flights with the planes grounded. 


The carriers still need revised inspection and maintenance instructions from Boeing that must be approved by the FAA before they can begin flying the planes again.  


Boeing on Tuesday told staff the findings were being treated as a "quality control issue" and checks were under way at Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N, Reuters reported previously. 


Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told CNBC on Wednesday that a "quality escape" was at issue in the Max 9 cabin blowout.  


The Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Portland, Oregon, on Friday and was flying at 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) when the panel tore off the plane, which had been in service for only eight weeks. Pilots returned the full jet to Portland, with only minor injuries suffered by people on board. 


Boeing's manufacturing practices "need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet," the FAA added. 


U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg declined to say on Wednesday when the FAA may allow the planes to resume flights but said it would only be when safe. 


"The only consideration on the timeline is safety," Buttigieg told reporters. "Until it is ready, it is not ready. Nobody can or should be rushed in that process." 


In 2019, global authorities subjected all Max planes to a wider grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346 people. 


Boeing ended 2023 in second place behind rival Airbus in aircraft deliveries for the fifth year running, after seeing its roughly 50% share of the market eroded by the earlier crisis. Airbus posted record annual jet orders on Thursday, booking nearly 2,100 net new orders in 2023, while Boeing booked 1,314 net new orders.

## NFL’s Patriots Part Ways with Coach Bill Belichick, Who Led Team to 6 Super Bowl Championships

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Six-time National Football League champion Bill Belichick agreed to part ways as the coach of the New England Patriots, ending his 24-year tenure as the architect of the most decorated dynasty of the league's Super Bowl era.


Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft announced the move to the media Thursday at Gillette Stadium. They didn't take questions, though Kraft scheduled an availability for later in the day.


Belichick, 71, is just the third coach in NFL history to reach 300 career regular-season victories earlier this season, joining Hall of Famers Don Shula and George Halas. With 333 wins including the playoffs, Belichick trails only Shula (347) for the record for victories by a coach.


But the Patriots ended this season 4-13, Belichick's worst record in 29 seasons as an NFL head coach. It supplanted the 5-11 mark he managed in his last year in Cleveland in 1995 and again in his first year in New England in 2000. Including the playoffs, he ends his Patriots tenure with a 333-178 overall record.


With his cutoff hoodies and ever-present scowl, Belichick teamed with quarterback Tom Brady to lead the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories, nine AFC titles and 17 division championships in 19 years. During a less successful — but also tumultuous — stint with the original Cleveland Browns, Belichick earned 37 of his career victories.


It's not immediately clear who Kraft will tap to replace the future Hall of Famer.


Patriots linebackers coach Jerod Mayo won a Super Bowl ring playing under Belichick and has interviewed for multiple head coaching vacancies since becoming a New England assistant in 2019. Mayo turned down a few interviews last offseason before signing a contract extension to remain with the Patriots.


Mike Vrabel, who was fired earlier this week by the Tennessee Titans and won three Super Bowls with the Patriots, is also expected to be a candidate for the head coaching job.


Belichick had been grooming offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to replace him before McDaniels left following the 2021 season to become the coach of the Raiders. He has since been fired by Las Vegas. Belichick's two sons, Steve and Brian, are also on the coaching staff.


Belichick's exit from the Patriots comes just a day after another legendary coach and his longtime friend Nick Saban announced he'd retire after winning seven college national championships. Saban worked for Belichick's father, Steve, in the 1980s as a coach at Navy, and Bill Belichick hired Saban as his defensive coordinator when he became Cleveland's head coach in 1991.


The six Super Bowl wins tie Belichick with pre-merger mentors Halas and Curly Lambeau for the most NFL championships. Belichick also won two rings as Bill Parcells' defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.


But the Patriots have stumbled to a 29-38 record since Brady departed following the 2019 season and missed the playoffs in three of those four seasons. Beginning in 2001 when Brady became the starting quarterback, the Patriots missed the playoffs only once (2008) when Brady was injured. This marked New England's fifth consecutive season without a playoff victory.


Belichick's subsequent solutions at quarterback haven't panned out.


Brady's initial replacement, Cam Newton, didn't resemble the player who won the 2015 MVP award and was cut after a 7-9 finish in 2020. Meanwhile Brady won his seventh Super Bowl ring with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that same season.


Potential long-term replacement Mac Jones, a 2021 first-round draft choice, was a Pro Bowl selection as a rookie and led New England to the playoffs. But he regressed in Year 2 when Belichick put longtime defensive assistant Matt Patricia in charge of the offense. Jones didn't fare much better this season when Bill O'Brien returned as offensive coordinator. He was benched four times before being replaced as starter by backup Bailey Zappe for the final six games.


That left the Patriots looking at a lengthy rebuild, with no candidate on the roster to bring stability to the sport's most important position.


Belichick, who also served as the de facto general manager with final say on personnel decisions, was celebrated for his ingenuity managing the salary cap during the run of Super Bowl success. It included getting stars like Brady and others to accept cap-friendly contracts or adjust their deals to accommodate the signing of other players.


But that acclaim has waned in the years since Brady left, as a run of draft picks and high-priced free agents didn't live up to expectations. In addition, Belichick has seen several members of his personnel and scouting departments leave for other jobs. The list includes his former player personnel director, Nick Caserio, who was hired as Houston's general manager in 2021.


Now it won't be Belichick making the decisions for the Patriots on or off the field.


The only child of a World War II veteran who spent three decades as a Navy assistant coach, Belichick is a football historian with an encyclopedic knowledge of strategy from the sport's early days to current NFL trends. His players said his attention to detail never left them unprepared.


Belichick has been a master of the NFL rule book, unearthing loopholes in clock operations and offensive line formations that -- though entirely legal -- cemented his reputation as a mad genius.


But his legacy in New England also includes two major cheating investigations — and other, minor ones — that cost him and the team draft picks and more than $1 million in fines. Opponents accused the Patriots of everything from hacking their headsets to cutting corners on injury reports.


His friendship with former President Donald Trump, which Belichick insisted was not political, landed the coach on the list to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom in the waning days of the administration. After the outcry against the U.S. Capitol siege, Belichick announced "the decision has been made not to move forward."

## Albany's Afghan Americans Help Afghan Refugees Resettle

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

Albany, New York — A group of Afghan Americans in Albany, New York, have opened a community center to help resettle newly arrived Afghans in the United States. 


The Afghans, who fled their country after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, received help navigating the U.S. immigration system and starting a new life in the United States.  


"[When] the [Afghan] government collapsed and more Afghans came to the U.S., the [U.S.] government could not handle [the cases], so we considered it necessary to support them," Yousaf Sherzad, vice president of the Afghan American Community Center, told VOA. "We rented this office to help the newly arrived Afghans begin their new life here [in the U.S.]." 


The center, which mostly serves families and single men, was launched in 2021, the same year the United States and its allies left Afghanistan, evacuating some 130,000 people from Kabul in the chaotic last weeks of August.  


Through Operation Allies Welcome, about 88,500 Afghan nationals arrived in the U.S. and resettled in communities across the country. Operation Allies Welcome was a program that coordinated efforts to resettle vulnerable Afghans.  


But those left behind are still making their way to the U.S., and there are limited immigration paths available for those hoping to come to the United States.


One way is to apply for a visa, but that requires them to travel to a U.S. embassy for an interview. The closest U.S. embassies to Afghanistan are in Qatar, Pakistan, or the United Arab Emirates. 


Another way is to apply for humanitarian parole on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website, but that is a lengthy process. And although it approves only a few hundred people annually, it does lead to permanent U.S. residency.  


The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services receives fewer than 2,000 requests for humanitarian parole overall from all nationalities over the course of a typical year. Of those requests, approximately 500 to 700 are approved. 


Since July 1, 2021, the USCIS has received more than 50,420 requests for humanitarian parole for Afghan nationals, of which they have denied about 11,020.  


"USCIS has conditionally approved humanitarian parole for approximately 480 Afghan nationals outside the U.S.," a Biden official wrote to VOA in an email on last August.  


A third option for Afghans is to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border and request asylum protection. The center also helps those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization and ended up in Albany.  


And that is what newly arrived Afghan, Shakor, who did not want to give his last name for security reasons, decided to do. 


"It has been 15 days since we came from Mexico," Shakor said. "One of my friends guided me and brought me to the Afghan community." 


Most people working at the center are volunteers who arrived in the U.S. before August 2021. They went through immigration procedures themselves and want to help refugees and asylum-seekers because of their own experience. 


"Based on what we have learned, listened and experienced, we want to make things easier for them by providing them with addresses, translation and filing their forms," Sherzad said. 


Volunteers at the center say that every day they see and help three to five Afghans who entered the United States at the U.S.-Mexico border. 


Roshan Noorzai  contributed to this report.

## Pluralistic: The REAL AI automation threat to workers (11 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-11, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The real AI automation threat to workers: The robot can't replace you, but it CAN replace your shitty boss. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The real AI automation threat to workers (permalink) Long before the current wave of AI hype, we were being groomed for automation panics with misleading stories. Remember this one? "'Truck driver' is the most common job in America. Self-driving trucks are just around the corner. How can we prevent America's army of truckers from turning into a howling mob when the robots steal their jobs?" https://futurism.com/millions-of-jobs-are-at-risk-but-their-loss-could-be-for-the-greater-good It was absolute nonsense. First of all, "truck driver" isn't a particularly common job in America! The BLS lumps together all cargo vehicle drivers under a single classification. The category error here was thinking that every delivery van driver, furniture mover, and courier is behind the wheel of a big rig, cracking wise on a CB radio as they tear up the interstate. But what about automation threats? It's possible that if we redesigned the interstates to give 18 wheelers their own separated lanes, and then set them to following one another, that they could traverse long distances in that way. Congratulations, you've just invented a shitty, failure-prone train. "Shitty train AI" does not threaten the job of the vast number of people the BLS classifies as "truck drivers." For one thing, "shitty train AI" isn't going to pilot a UPS van around the streets of a busy city with other road users. Sure, a few robotaxi companies have bamboozled city governments into conscripting the city's residents into an uncontrolled murderbot experiment. These are not going well: https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/9-key-leaders-depart-gms-cruise-amid-ongoing-investigation-into-san-francisco-incident/ More than $100b has been set on fire chasing the robotaxi dream, and the result is most charitably described as a technological curiosity, requiring 1.5 high-waged remote technicians to replace each low-waged driver: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/herbies-revenge/#100-billion-here-100-billion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money But even if we could perfect this technology, robots still wouldn't replace all those "truckers" who drive delivery vans (to say nothing of moving vans!). The hard part of driving a UPS van isn't just getting it from place to place &#8211; it's getting the parcel into the place. The robo-van would still need at least one person to get the parcel from the back of the van and into the reception desk, porch, or other delivery zone. It's not going to fire those parcels at your door with a catapult. It's also not going to deliver them by drones. Drone delivery is another one of those historical curiosities, capable of delivering a very narrow range of parcels, under even narrower circumstances: https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/05/comprehensive-sex-ed/#droned If all UPS delivered was lightweight, non-fragile rectangular parcels ordered by people with large, unobstructed back yards, then sure. Congrats, you've just created the world's least-useful parcel delivery service! https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/amazon-drone-delivery-service-seeks-faa-approval-to-launch-in-2022/ All that said, the big rig drivers probably don't need to worry about robots stealing their jobs. It's not even clear that "shitty train" is within our technological grasp, but even if it is, there's yet another problem with the AI automation trucker jobpocalypse: "trucker" is already one of the worst jobs in America: https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/news/rigged-forced-into-debt-worked-past-exhaustion-left-with-nothing/ It's hard to overstate just how fucking terrible it is to be a trucker. Truckers are trapped in abusive debt holes by their employers &#8211; who misclassify their workforce as "contractors" in a bid to sidestep labor law. Shriven of any labor rights, truckers are forced into the most ghastly, body-destroying, family-wrcking, financially precarious existence imaginable. You can drive a truck for years, give almost all of the money you earn back to your employer (who denies that you're their employee) to pay back the usurious loan for your truck. Then, your employer can underschedule for shifts so that you miss a loan payment, and they can repo your truck and keep the six-figure repayment you've already made to them, leaving you destitute. They can force you to work for hours &#8211; days! &#8211; without pay while you wait for loading and dispatch. They can make you drive long past the point of safety, then, if (when) you get into a wreck, they can fine you for not taking the mandated rest breaks. Now, these drivers aren't about to be replaced by AI &#8211; but that doesn't mean that AI won't affect their jobs. Commercial drivers are among the most heavily surveilled workers in the country. Amazon's drivers (whom Amazon misclassifies as subcontractors) have their eyeballs monitored by AI; https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/ AIs monitor the voices of the (primarily Black, primarily female) workforce at Arise &#8211; homeworkers who field customer service calls for blue-chip companies like Carnival Cruises and Disney. They're listening for unruly children or pets in the background, and workers who fail to muffle these dependents lose the contracts they have to pay to train for: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless And AI monitors the conduct of workers on temp-work apps. If a worker is dispatched to a struck workplace and refuses to cross the picket-line, the AI boss fires you and blacklists you from future jobs for refusing to robo-scab: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/30/computer-says-scab/#instawork Writing in The Guardian, Steven Greenhouse describes the AI-enabled workplace, where precarious, often misclassified workers are monitored, judged, and fined by algorithms: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/07/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-workers Whether it's the robot that gets you disciplined for sending an email with the word "union" in it or the robot that takes money out of your paycheck if you take a bathroom break, AI has come for the workplace with a vengeance. Here's a supreme irony: nearly all of the beneficial applications for AI require that AI be used to help workers, not replace them, which is absolutely not how AI is used in the workplace. An AI that helps radiologists by giving them a second opinion might help them find tumors on x-rays, but that's a tool that reduces the number of scans a radiologist processes in a shift, by making them go back and reconsider the scans they've already processed: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ But AI's sales pitch is not "Buy an AI tool and increase your costs while increasing your accuracy." The pitch for AI is "buy and AI and save money by firing workers." Given how bad AIs are at replacing humans, this is a bad deal all around, both for the worker who loses their job and the customer who gets the substandard product the AI makes. There is a very limited slice of applications where an AI could make a lot of money for a company that deploys it, without costing that company anything when the AI screws up. For example, AI is a really good tool for fraud! Rather than paying people to churn out millions of variations on a phishing email, you can get an AI to do it. If the AI writes a bad phishing email, it's OK, since nearly all recipients of even good phishing emails delete them. What's more, no one will fine you or publish an op-ed demanding that your board of directors fire you if you buy an incompetent AI to commit fraud. Fraud is a high-value, low-consequence environment for using AI. Another one of those applications is managing precarious workers who don't have labor rights. If the AI unfairly docks your worker's wages, or forces them to work until they injure themselves or others, or decides that their eyeball movements justify firing them, those workers have no recourse. That's the whole point of pretending that your employees are contractors: so you can violate labor law with impunity! But that's not the ironic part. The ironic part is that "being a shitty boss" is the one AI application that companies are willing to increase their net spending on. No one buys an eyeball-monitoring AI so they can fire a manager. This is the one place where AI is there to augment, rather than replace, an employee. This makes AI-based bossware subtly different from other forms of Taylorism, the "scientific management" fad of the early 20th century that saw management consultants choreographing the postures and movements of workers to satisfy the aesthetic fetishes of their employers: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware The pseudoscientific cod-ergonomics of the 1900s was demeaning and even dangerous, but it wasn't automated, and if it increased worker output, this was incidental to the real purpose of making workers move like the machine-cogs their bosses reassured themselves they were: https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/21/great-taylors-ghost/#solidarity-or-bust Every AI panic is a way of deflecting attention from the real, grimy, here-and-now ways that AI is destroying our lives by demanding that we entertain nonsensical science fiction claims about large, shiny existential risks that AI might present in the future. The "X-risk" of the spicy autocomplete chatbot waking up and using its newfound sentience to turn us all into paperclips is nonsense. Adding words to the plausible sentence generator doesn't turn it into a superintelligence for the same reason that selectively breeding faster horses doesn't lead to locomotives: https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ But there is a way that AI could destroy the human race! The carbon footprint and water consumption associated with training and operating large-scale models are significant contributors to the climate emergency, which threatens the habitability of the only planet in the known universe capable of sustaining human life: https://www.forbes.com/sites/federicoguerrini/2023/04/14/ais-unsustainable-water-use-how-tech-giants-contribute-to-global-water-shortages/ Likewise, AI isn't going to replace you at work. But it's already augmenting your shitty boss's ability to rip you off, torment you, maim you and even kill you in order to eke out a few more basis points for the next shareholder report. Science fiction is a fun and useful way to tell parables about our current technologies. But it's not a roadmap for the future. The fact that sf writers like me found AIs as useful measures to describe Earth's dominant artificial life form &#8211; the limited liability corporation &#8211; doesn't mean that superhuman AIs should &#8211; or can &#8211; be created.

## Cutting through the noise of today’s inflation report

date: 2024-01-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Overall inflation ticked up to 3.4% year over year in December, which is higher than November&#8217;s inflation rate. But, if you take out food and energy prices (which are notoriously volatile), inflation actually slowed down slightly. We look at how to slice today&#8217;s inflation report. Then, wage growth has been slowing, an IRS watchdog report shows mixed grades, and the SEC approves a bitcoin ETF.</p>

## NASA’s Fermi Detects Surprise Gamma-Ray Feature Beyond Our Galaxy

Astronomers analyzing 13 years of data from NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have found an unexpected and as yet unexplained feature outside of our galaxy. “It is a completely serendipitous discovery,” said Alexander Kashlinsky, a cosmologist at the University of Maryland and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, who presented the research at the […]

## The Year’s Biggest Gadget Conference Is All About Electric Cars Now

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA0ODYzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNjg4MTgxM30.rj90DnA_ZG_1E2jNZE9ncxk6RcAs0wJQN-F-qEHdVqk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
	The consumer electronics show in Las Vegas formally known as CES has evolved beyond a showcase for ever-larger screens, laptops, and niche gadgets looking to make it into big box retailers. CES is now, among other things, a full-fledged auto show, with the world's largest automakers announcing ambitious products alongside — and sometimes in partnership with — their tech counterparts.
</p><p>
	In recent years, new electric concepts from <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-ces-2021-keynote-chevy-cadillac-flying-cars-concepts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevrolet</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ces-2022-car-roundup-bmw-cadillac-chevy-chrysler-hyundai-mercedes-sony/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMW</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540709/ram-1500-revolution-concept-ev-truck-ces-photos-specs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ram</a> have each captured attention. This year, it was Honda’s turn to make a splash.
</p><p>
	After two decades of dipping its toes into the electric vehicle market, the Japanese carmaker announced the new 0 Series (as in zero emissions) with two concepts that show what Honda wants to bring to the U.S. market in 2026.
</p><p>
	The flagship <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46328379/hondas-saloon-concept-looks-right-out-of-cyberpunk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Saloon</a> sedan’s sleek, swept-back design is a material manifestation of what Honda calls its man maximum/machine minimum packaging concept (in case you’re looking for an acronym, it’s M/M*1), which boils down to making the car’s footprint as small as possible while still keeping passengers comfortable. On the other end of the svelte-practical spectrum is the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g46317582/honda-saloon-space-hub-concepts-revealed-gallery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Space-Hub</a>, which applies the venerable minivan concept in an EV format with extra space and seating that swivels to create a rolling lounge.
</p><p>
	Honda was also at CES in partnership with Sony, which showed the latest iteration of its <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Afeela</a> prototype, the electronics company's first foray into the automotive world. Sony's Playstation division clearly got its hands on the concept, which means augmented reality displays built on the game development platform Unreal Engine that feature eye-popping 3D graphics. If you want, you can have a monster magically appear on the roadway as you’re driving. You can also visualize yourself driving underwater. On stage at least, the car could be steered with a Playstation controller.
</p><p>
	Kia was back in Las Vegas to announce its hyper-modular, commercial-focused <a href="https://www.kiamedia.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/21668/kia-announces-platform-beyond-vehicle-business-at-ces-2024-to-go-beyond-mobility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Platform Beyond Vehicle</a> strategy. Showing five models in three sizes all based on the platform, the new lineup will begin with the PV5 and focus on delivery, ride-hailing, and smaller commercial work (think your local electrician) thanks to its Lego-like “life modules” and powertrains.
</p><p>
	This being 2024, AI is everywhere at CES, even in car world, with Volkswagen incorporating ChatGPT into its Ida voice assistant, Mercedes updating its MBUX Virtual Assistant with a new “empathetic” AI, and Intel designing a new family of AI-infused systems-on-chips to monitor drivers and passengers in an autonomous future.
</p><p>
	While most CES concepts aren’t headed for roads anytime soon, one thing you might be able to buy is the latest offering from Vietnamese EV maker VinFast. While its U.S. launch is <a href="https://jalopnik.com/vinfast-vf8-electric-car-first-drive-not-ready-for-u-s-1849892217" target="_blank">off to a rocky start</a>, the ultra-compact VF3 might be cute enough to keep the critics at bay, with its bulldog stance and incredibly diminutive size. Measuring in at just a little under 10.5 feet, the VF3 is nearly two feet shorter than <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fiat-500e-morgan-xp-1-electric-cars" target="_self">the new Fiat 500E</a> or about the same size as a Smart car. Coupled with its off-roader looks and a claimed 125-mile range, the VF3 could be the smallest, affordable, and most adorable EVs for sale in the U.S.
</p>

## Ideas for Reading Lists

date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html">reading list</a> is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.</p>
<p>The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from the ones that leave.</p>
<p>Reading lists are not a new topic, I and others have been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+reading+lists">writing</a> about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+reading+lists">them</a> for years. But they've not been used seriously in the past because they weren't widely supported in feed readers. <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, my latest feed manager, has reading list support built-in. And we're serious about starting new communities of feeds and users with this feature. </p>
<p>If you're a feed reader user, you probably know about using OPML to move your subscriptions from one app to another, or to share lists with friends. </p>
<p>Reading lists take it one step further, you can subscribe to a reading list, so you can control one app from another.  </p>
<p>Say I had a reading list with my favorite podcasts and my podcasting client could subscribe to it. Then when I add a feed to that list on my desktop computer, the podcast client would automatically be subscribed to it. Or if I used two or more podcast clients (say one on Android and one on iOS), I could control both from the same subscription list.</p>
<p>It factors out subscribing. Now you can use one app to manage subscriptions and use lots of apps to read them.</p>
<p>What's cool about this is that it opens up the possibility for lots of viewer apps. A podcast client is a special kind of feed reader. I'm sure others are possible. But first, to make this practical we need to do better with subscriptions. That's what reading lists are for. </p>
<p>Another idea. Suppose we wanted to put together a big list of great blogs about Major League Baseball (just an example). I might know a few about the Mets, and my friend Scott who lives in Mountain View, CA, would have a bunch about the Giants. We could put together a group of 100 avid baseball fans, and one of us could put out a reading list for all of our feeds merged into one list. It's not so far-fetched, <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> can do that today. </p>
<p>I could see a similar "big blogroll" for the IndieWeb, or for Bluesky developers -- or really anything. We just have to get started, prime the pump, and learn how this works. </p>
<p>I felt it was really important to get reading lists built into FeedLand in the current release, because now we're in a position, with the improvements in scaling, to act as a organizing node for new activities with feeds. </p>
<p>This is another form of federation, it's more ad hoc, and doesn't require very much technical knowledge. If you know how to use a feed reader, and move around OPML files, you can do all of what I describe in this piece. </p>

## Ecosia

date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog

<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/ecosia.png" alt="screenshot of the ecosia homepage with a search bar in the middle and playful colors and illustrations at the borders" height="719" width="1200">
<p>Last year I switched my default search engine twice. First from Bing to Duck Duck Go. It felt different but during <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/01/shadow-banned-by-duckduckgo-and-bing/">my Bing de-listing fiasco</a> I learned that Duck Duck Go and lots of other smaller search engines use the Bing Index. One of the more interesting engines I learned about was Ecosia, a green search engine that I switched to a couple months ago.</p>
<p>Ecosia’s twist on the search engine game is that for every ~50 searches you do, they plant 1 tree. They serve you ads and that revenue pays for trees. It seems gimmicky or unbelievable, but Ecosia posts <a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/">all their financials are on their website</a>. I find that to be a refreshing amount of transparency from a search engine. According to the website, in October they financed the planting of ~2.5 million trees in 12 different countries. That’s admirable.</p>
<p>Getting rewarded by a search engine for searching isn’t new to me. I switched to Bing in 2015 as part of #davegoeswindows and one neat side effect was that I got “Bing Bucks” for my searches which I could convert into gift cards to use at real stores; paid to play. For years I ran a grift of converting Bing Bucks into Robux for the kids. Now I’m doing that same grift, but for trees for my children’s future. In a couple months since switching I’ve funded 20 trees which feels nice.</p>
<p>How big of a difference can a “green” search engine make? Good question and I spent a dumb amount of time looking into this. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02001.pdf">Based on some research</a> Ecosia calculates that one search offsets 50kg of CO₂.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The tree planting that we’re doing, with each search, you’re actually removing around 50 kilograms of CO₂.”
Source: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-rate-hikes-for-bing-use-may-put-this-google-alternative-out-of">PCMag</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is 50kg a lot? It sounds like a lot, but I need that in terms I understand. This summer I learned that <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentincludes/co2_inc.htm">a gallon of gas weighs 6.3lbs (2.8kg) yet produces 20lbs (9kg) of CO₂</a>. Gas is a form of carbon emissions I understand, so let’s use that as a baseline.</p>
<p>If my math is correct and every search removes 50kg of CO₂… that’s equal to offsetting 5.5 gallons of gas… or about one jerrycan.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/search-jerry.svg" alt="illustration of a magnifying glass with 1x, two equals signs, and a crude jerry can" height="390" width="798">
<p><a href="(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Standard_SUV_2WD2023.shtml)">According to FuelEconomy.gov, the average non-hybrid/non-electric SUV in 2024 gets an average of ~20.6 MPG</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. One search then offsets ~113 miles of driving in an SUV<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. Making that specific to my life, it takes three searches to offset a tank of gas in my Volvo and seven for my F-150. Those numbers are good enough to make me a bit skeptical.</p>
<p>Planting trees isn’t a climate silver bullet<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>. Trees take years to grow and a gallon of gas burns in less than an hour. Trees will struggle to grow in hotter climates as well. There’s no replacement for carbon reduction…but —as we say in Texas— it’s not nothing? Tree planting is potentially <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aax0848#:~:text=Excluding%20existing%20trees%20and%20agricultural%20and%20urban%20areas%2C%20we%20found%20that%20there%20is%20room%20for%20an%20extra%200.9%20billion%20hectares%20of%20canopy%20cover%2C%20which%20could%20store%20205%20gigatonnes%20of%20carbon%20in%20areas%20that%20would%20naturally%20support%20woodlands%20and%20forests.">a 220 gigaton opportunity</a> and currently the only viable form of carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>I looked into how much planting a tree costs and the prices vary from $1 to $3 dollars. The <a href="https://shop.arborday.org/campaign/reforestation-007/give">Arbor Day Foundation</a> costs $1/tree, <a href="https://preserve.nature.org/page/81927/donate/1?engrid_session=MTMxNDk0ZjEtOGEwYi00OWZhLTlkMzItN2I5ZWYzMTBlOGEyfDE3MDMxMjUwNDZ8MTcwMzEyNTA4OXwxfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8fGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8">The Nature Conservancy</a> and <a href="https://treeswaterpeople.org/give-a-gift">Trees, Water, People</a> both cost ~$2/tree. And Ecosia’s own <a href="https://plant.ecosia.org/products/trees-for-climate-action?variant=37125904662702">Ecosia Tree Store</a> comes in at the highest at $3/tree. That means by searching I’ve planted anywhere from $20-$60 worth of trees. It might be more effective if I donated a lump sum and installed an ad blocker; but Ecosia’s trees are an entirely passive benefit and that makes it sustainable for me. I think about it like putting a solar panel on my air conditioner.</p>
<p>Ecosia’s use of the Bing Index might be a dealbreaker for some, but all that might be changing! Due to a price hike in the Bing Index, <a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/new-search-features/">Ecosia announced that in certain locales they’re switching to the Google Index</a>. I’ve used Bing’s Index for years so this isn’t a problem for me, but I understand people are picky about their search results. I’d also call out that <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/">the entire SEO ecosystem is changing with the advent of AI</a> and the reliability of search results will experience a tectonic shift. Speaking of AI… at the end of that same announcement post, Ecosia says they’re piloting an experimental AI Chat feature.</p>
<p>Ecosia is a feel-good search engine and I love the idea of a benefit-corp style search engine. I want my “behavioral exhaust” (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">Zubhoff, 2019</a>) to replenish the environment rather than fund the techno-monopoly war chest. Ecosia is a welcome change in my online life. It’s well-designed compared to other search engines and planting 20 trees feels good. If we all pointed our search bars at Ecosia for a while, what kind of difference could we make. Alone, we will never make a dent in the climate but together we stand a chance.</p>
<p>And that’s where I wanted to end this review but…</p>
<p>I wanted this to be a review of a new’ish search engine that I enjoy, but I need to address the LLM in the room. In short, the AI feature seems off-brand for Ecosia –like Captain Planet getting into Bitcoin. At <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generative-ai-water-use-environmental-impact-study-2023-4">500ml of water for every 20 prompts</a> or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4">1.7 billion gallons of water to train GPT</a>, LLMs use a lot of energy and resources. Ecosia claims they are able to offset the carbon costs of LLMs – I’d love to see more data on this – but when every search engine is experimenting in this space, it’d be nice to have an option that’s taking a different path.</p>

## VOA Exclusive: Blinken to Meet Chinese Foreign Minister Candidate Before Taiwan Election

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to meet with Liu Jianchao, a veteran Chinese diplomat and a top contender to be China's next foreign minister, in Washington on Friday, a day before Taiwan’s elections, as the United States continues to caution China against using the elections as a pretext for instability. 


Communication between the world’s two largest economies will continue after Taiwan’s presidential and legislative elections on Saturday, as senior officials from the United States and China are slated to attend next week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 


On Friday, Blinken will hold talks at the U.S. State Department with Liu, who heads the Chinese Communist Party’s international department responsible for maintaining relations with foreign political parties. 


“Liu is a trusted member of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s inner circles of advisers. He is a leading candidate for foreign minister,” according to former CIA top China analyst Dennis Wilder, now a professor at Georgetown University.


Wilder told VOA on Thursday that Liu’s visit is “designed in part to make sure Washington and Beijing understand each other before the new Taiwan leader is elected.” 


Daniel Kritenbrink, the State Department’s top diplomat on East Asian and Pacific affairs, will join the hourlong meeting, according to people familiar with the planning. 


"Liu has taken on a more active diplomatic role and has been performing tasks typically handled by China's foreign minister,” said Chechuan Lee, a research fellow at the Taipei-based quasi-official Institute for National Defense and Security Research.


Lee told VOA that "it is not unimaginable" that Liu could be selected as China’s next top diplomat, and his meetings in Washington this week with senior U.S. officials may be paving the way for his next position.


Next week, Blinken and Chinese Premier Li Qiang will attend the annual economic meetings at the Swiss mountain resort.


The State Department said in a statement that Blinken would discuss issues of global concern, including the U.S. commitment to the rules-based international order, while attending meetings in the World Economic Forum in Davos. 


Blinken’s talks with Chinese officials are described as ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, responsibly manage differences between the two nations and address a host of issues. These include global and regional security concerns such as tensions on the South China Sea. Taiwan will also be among the topics. 


Washington has voiced its opposition to “outside interference or malign influence” in Taiwan’s elections.


 




On Thursday, State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said the U.S. has “a deep confidence in Taiwan's democratic process and believe it is for Taiwan voters to decide their next leader, free from outside interference.” 


The winner of Taiwan’s presidential election will be inaugurated on May 20. The transition period in the upcoming months is seen as sensitive in cross-strait relations. 


A senior U.S. administration official told reporters late Wednesday that Beijing would be “the provocateur” if it chose to respond to Taiwan's election results with additional military pressure or coercion. 


“Throughout this election and transition period, we will ensure that channels of communication remain open with Beijing, including diplomatic and the recently reopened military-to-military channels, in keeping with past precedent and our unofficial relationship with Taiwan," said the U.S. official. 


A number of meetings 


This week, U.S. and Chinese officials are holding numerous meetings. The U.S. principal deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, held lengthy talks with Liu on Wednesday. 


The White House said the two sides discussed the ongoing implementation of key outcomes from last November’s summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Xi, challenges in the Middle East and Russia’s war against Ukraine. Finer stressed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea. 


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas held virtual talks on Wednesday with Chinese Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong, discussing the combating of the illicit flow of synthetic drugs. 


U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo also held a call with China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao late Wednesday to follow up on leveraging the working group that the two sides have established to address commercial issues of concern. 


Science and technology agreement 


At the State Department, officials from the two countries discussed the extension of the U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement, or STA, which is due to expire next month. Officials will meet again during the week of January 22 to discuss the extension. 


Late last August, Washington agreed to extend the agreement with China for six months. The short-term extension came as several Republican congressional members voiced concern that China has previously leveraged the agreement to advance its military objectives and may continue to do so. 


At that time, the State Department stated the brief extension would maintain the STA's validity while the U.S. negotiated with China to amend and strengthen the agreement. 


A call for reciprocity 


Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about whether frequent talks can fundamentally change Beijing’s behaviors, which are deemed as harming Washington’s national interests. They also advocate for reciprocity. 


“Every time a People’s Republic of China emissary is allowed to address the American people, an American emissary needs to be able to directly address the Chinese people. If the PRC won’t accept this, then we are foolish to keep giving people like Liu direct access,” said David Stilwell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. 


Liu delivered a speech on Tuesday during an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.

## Trump's New York Civil Fraud Trial Heads to Closing Arguments After Bomb Threat

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

New York — Donald Trump 's New York civil fraud trial is back in session Thursday for closing arguments after authorities responded to a bomb threat at the home of the judge who moved this week to prevent the former president from delivering his own closing statements.


Authorities responded to the threat at Judge Arthur Engoron's home on Long Island, a court official said. The proceedings are not expected to be delayed as a result.


Trump, the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, had angled to deliver his own closing remarks in the courtroom, in addition to summations from his legal team, but a judge nixed that unusual plan Wednesday.


That will leave the last words to the lawyers in a trial over allegations that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements he provided to banks, insurance companies and others.


"There was a threat. I can confirm a bomb threat," said Al Baker, a court spokesperson. "As of now we are going forward as scheduled and the court proceedings and closing arguments are going ahead as planned."


New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, wants the judge to impose $370 million in penalties. Trump says he did nothing wrong, didn't lie about his fortune and is the victim of political persecution.


The former president had hoped to make that argument personally, but the judge — initially open to the idea — said no after a Trump lawyer missed a deadline for agreeing to ground rules. Among them, Judge Engoron warned that Trump couldn't use his closing remarks to "deliver a campaign speech" or use the opportunity to impugn the judge and his staff.


Trump is still expected to be in court as a spectator, despite the death of his mother in-law, Amalija Knavs, and the launch of the presidential primary season Monday with the Iowa caucus.


Since the trial began Oct. 2, Trump has gone to court nine times to observe, testify and complain to TV cameras about the case, which he called a "witch hunt and a disgrace."


He clashed with Engoron and state lawyers during 3½ hours on the witness stand in November and remains under a limited gag order after making a disparaging and false social media post about the judge's law clerk.


Thursday's arguments are part of a busy legal and political stretch for Trump.


On Tuesday, he was in court in Washington, D.C., to watch appeals court arguments over whether he is immune from prosecution on charges that he plotted to overturn the 2020 election — one of four criminal cases against him. Trump has pleaded not guilty.


James sued Trump in 2022 under a state law that gives the state attorney general broad power to investigate allegations of persistent fraud in business dealings.


Engoron decided some of the key issues before testimony began. In a pretrial ruling, he found that Trump had committed years of fraud by lying about his riches on financial statements with tricks like claiming his Trump Tower penthouse was nearly three times its actual size, or valuing his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida at more than $612 million based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, when he had signed an agreement surrendering rights to develop it for any uses but a club.


The trial involves six undecided claims, including allegations of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records.


Trump's company and two of his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are also defendants.


Besides monetary damages, James wants Trump and his co-defendants barred from doing business in New York.


State lawyers say that by making himself seem richer, Trump qualified for better loan terms from banks, saving him at least $168 million.


Trump contends his financial statements actually understated his net worth. He said the outside accountants that helped prepare the statements should've flagged any discrepancies and that the documents came with disclaimers that shield him from liability.


Engoron said he is deciding the case because neither side asked for a jury and state law doesn't allow for juries for this type of lawsuit. He said he hopes to have a decision by the end of the month.


Last month, in a ruling denying a defense bid for an early verdict, the judge signaled he's inclined to find Trump and his co-defendants liable on at least some claims.


"Valuations, as elucidated ad nauseam in this trial, can be based on different criteria analyzed in different ways," Engoron wrote in the Dec. 18 ruling. "But a lie is still a lie."

## The IEA's Optimistic Renewables Report

IEA report shows renewables expansion gaining momentum</h3><p><strong></strong>The International Energy Agency (IEA) is feeling optimistic about the green energy transition. In its new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d19988f73d&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">Renewables 2023 report</a>, released today, the agency says the world added 50% more renewable capacity last year than in 2022. This kind of momentum could get us close to the COP28 goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, but governments must do more to get us across the finish line, the IEA concluded. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Solar was the real workhorse, accounting for 75% of the expansion. The report includes this quite astonishing statistic:<em> <strong>“The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the next five years than has been installed since the first commercial renewable energy power plant was built more than 100 years ago.”</strong></em><br/><br/>The current growth rate puts the world on course to increase renewable capacity by two-and-a-half times by 2030, said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. He calls on governments to prioritize policy changes that speed up renewables development, and highlights the need for more financing in developing countries to help them with the energy transition. “Success in meeting the tripling goal will hinge on this,” Birol <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=af364f86c6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><h3>2. Biden funnels $623 million into EV charging network buildout</h3><p><strong></strong>The Biden administration has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6f63dcdb7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> the recipients of infrastructure grants amounting to $623 million focused heavily on expanding the national electric vehicle charging network. The administration has a goal of installing at least 500,000 public chargers by 2030 – a Department of Energy <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4152c83ffa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> put the number at around 140,000 at the end of 2022, installed across 53,000 stations. Huge gaps in coverage remain across the country, fueling range anxiety among would-be EV buyers. The new grants are split between 22 states and Puerto Rico and will support 47 infrastructure projects, including 7,500 charging ports. About half of the money will go to “community” projects in urban and rural communities. The other half will go to “corridor” projects along roadways that are expected to “fill gaps in the core national charging and alternative-fueling network,” according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s press release.</p><h3>3. GOP presidential candidates pile on Biden for ‘green’ policies</h3><p><strong></strong>It appears that Republicans have a new favorite boogeyman buzzword this election season, writes <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f4fdf06dc3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Heatmap</em>’s Charu Sinha</a>. The word? “Green.” It was on every Republican presidential hopeful’s lips on Wednesday, both at CNN’s debate in Iowa between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and at former President Donald Trump’s competing town hall on Fox News. DeSantis reiterated his promise to reverse President Biden’s clean energy policy, facetiously calling it the “Green New Deal.” Haley took her own stab at Biden’s “green subsidies” while answering a question about funding Ukraine and Israel. And for his part, Trump said Biden should “go into the energy business instead of this green new scam business that they’re in."<br/><br/>Sinha notes that “at no point during the fifth Republican presidential debate or Trump’s town hall was the Inflation Reduction Act mentioned by name.”</p><h3>4. Bird flu found in mammals in Antarctica</h3><p><strong></strong>Bird flu strain H5N1 has been transmitted to seals in Antarctica, scientists have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f2321d9551&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">confirmed</a>, an alarming development that raises concerns about how easily the virus can spread among mammals. The virus, which has killed millions of birds across the world, was detected in elephant seals and fur seals on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Researchers believe migrating birds from South America brought the virus with them. Last week officials in Alaska confirmed a polar bear had died from the disease. “If a bird is weakened by avian influenza, or succumbs to it, polar bears aren’t fussy about what eat,” Andrew Derocher, a polar bear biologist at the University of Alberta, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8fe7ae10f4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Reuters</em>. “If it’s dead and it’s edible they’ll probably eat it. There is a high likelihood of an interaction between climate change, avian influenza, bird mortality, and polar bears.”</p><h3>5. Study: Snowpack worryingly low in parts of Northern Hemisphere</h3><p><strong></strong>The Northern Hemisphere is seeing less snowpack due to human-caused climate change, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c2caf64ca7&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">study</a> published in <em>Nature</em>. The researchers examined data from hundreds of river basins across the U.S. and Europe and found that about 20% of them saw a decline in snowpack – which is the total mass of snow that accumulates on the ground – over the last 40 years. “We see a pattern of snow change that is only consistent with human emissions,” Alex Gottlieb, a graduate student at Dartmouth College and lead author on the new study, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=41f3379e76&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>. The researchers also seem to have discovered a snow “cliff” – a tipping point temperature of 17 degrees Fahrenheit – at which snow loss accelerates very quickly. They say more than 2 billion people who rely on snow melt as a source of water are near the cliffedge.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>The cost of charging an EV in the U.S. is roughly equivalent to a gasoline price of $1 to $2 per gallon, with the national average being $1.41 per eGallon, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bc237e8157&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>Yale Climate Connections</em>.</p>

## Republican Politics In Iowa, Served Chilled

date: 2024-01-11, from: Dan Rather's Steady

I love politics and I love this country, but I don&#8217;t love cold weather. To this Texan, there&#8217;s cold, and there&#8217;s Iowa cold. For me, it&#8217;s the wind, the bitter wind blowing across the plains that just cuts you. I&#8217;ve spent my fair share of Januaries in the Hawkeye State reporting on the Iowa caucuses, and I can safely say there is no such thing as too much clothing. But stand by, because forecasters say this coming Monday may be the coldest ever for a caucus, with temperatures predicted to be below zero &#8212; all for an event that requires Iowans to leave the warm confines of their homes to participate in a presidential nominating contest.

## A Sublime Solution to Climate’s Hardest Problem

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyODA5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjM2NDQwMX0.A05dIenVMfV3DZd2jiOYADOhSvJIhj6lWEfDdWtQCq8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Over the past several months, in the sleepy city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, bulldozers have been tearing down a former paper mill. The newly leveled ground on the western banks of the Connecticut River is on its way to becoming the home of a big, industrial bet. If it pays off, what was once known as the Paper City could soon become the Clean Cement Capital — of the country, at least. Sublime Systems, a startup that has developed a process for producing the ubiquitous building material without releasing any carbon emissions, has chosen the site for its first commercial factory. </p><p>“It’s poetic justice,” Sublime’s CEO and co-founder, Leah Ellis, told me. “We’re excited about bringing clean technology to this community which has been damaged by a legacy of pollution from the old industry that used to happen there.”</p><p>The word cement is often used interchangeably with concrete, but it’s actually a key ingredient in the stuff that gets mixed and poured and hardened into sidewalks, roads, buildings. It is the glue that binds together sand, water, and gravel to form the fabric of our built environment. It’s also a major source of carbon emissions — 8% of the global total. And these aren’t like other kinds of emissions.</p><p>Scientists often split the climate problem into two categories. There’s the carbon that we know how to eliminate, like from power generation, home heating, and cars. And then there’s a group called the “hard to decarbonize” stuff — mostly emissions from industrial activities where clean solutions are still in early stages and not cost competitive. Cement is the poster child.</p><p>That’s because more than half of the emissions from cement come from a chemical reaction that’s intrinsic to its production. Cement consists of lime, silica, and water. It’s made by first heating up limestone in a kiln to more than 1,400 degrees Celsius (2,550 degrees Fahrenheit) — a level of heat that can typically be achieved only by burning coal or natural gas — to produce reactive lime. The bigger problem, though, is that limestone contains carbon, and as it heats up, that carbon is released as a gas. So even if you could heat the kiln with clean electricity instead of coal, there would still be carbon emitted by the process. </p><p>But Sublime has found another way. Ellis and her cofounder Yet-Ming Chiang — a serial entrepreneur who is also behind the buzzy battery startup Form Energy — developed a new way to make reactive lime that does not require limestone. Instead of heating up rocks in a kiln, they drive the chemical process with electric currents. This enables the company to avoid limestone and use a variety of other raw materials that do not contain carbon to produce lime.</p><p>When Ellis described her breakthrough to me, it sounded incredibly simple, like it might be obvious to anyone with a background in electrochemistry. “Why didn’t anyone else think of this?” I wanted to know.</p><p>“I believe this way of making cement is going to be obvious in retrospect, in a post-carbon world where you don’t use fossil fuels, where you’re penalized for CO2 emissions,” she told me. But she said there were three factors that led to this innovation in this moment. </p><p>First, we’ve reached a tipping point in figuring out how to decarbonize the electric grid. “That is the one key enabler. Once you’ve got a clean grid, that’s the tool to decarbonizing everything else.” </p><p>Second, Ellis happened to be in the right place at the right time. She started her career as a battery scientist and founded Sublime while completing a postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The interdisciplinary nature of the school, where she could collaborate with other departments, enabled her to expand the bounds of what she could do with her expertise. </p><p>And third, the technology Sublime uses to drive its chemical process — a device called an electrolyzer — has become much cheaper. Though electrolyzers have been around for a long time, they’ve recently benefited from increased economies of scale as interest in using them for applications like clean hydrogen production has grown. </p><p>For the past year, Sublime has been honing its process at a small pilot plant in Somerville, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. The new plant in Holyoke is designed to be many times larger — producing up to 30,000 tons of cement per year — though still smaller than the million tons per year that an average cement plant produces. The site is about half a mile down the river from a hydroelectric dam — a key consideration for the company, since it needs to power the plant with clean electricity.</p><p>The project is not yet fully financed, but Sublime has received $1 million in tax credits from the state of Massachusetts and is holding out hope for a federal grant from the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. </p><p>There are a number of other emerging methods to reduce emissions from cement, including alternative chemical combinations and installing carbon capture equipment on cement plants, but it’s far from being removed from the “hard to decarbonize” club. The question, as always, is whether Sublime and others will be able to produce a high-quality product — one that passes the strength and durability tests required for the construction industry — at scale, and at a competitive price. </p><p>Sublime’s product is certainly more expensive than conventional cement today. But its solution is cheaper than using carbon capture, Ellis said. Capturing the carbon from a cement plant generally requires a big increase in energy use. And while the technology has been under development for decades, it’s so far failed to be applied economically outside the natural gas processing industry. In a world where builders are required to use lower-carbon materials, or where there’s a price on carbon, Ellis thinks Sublime will have an advantage. Governments at various levels in the U.S. have already started to implement “buy clean” programs that require the use of lower-carbon cement for state and federal construction projects, so Sublime may have an edge in some markets once its Holyoke plant is up and running.</p><p>“Our process is true zero,” she said. “It just doesn’t emit.”</p>

## Ayaneo Next Lite handheld announced with SteamOS Linux

date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News

inally we&#8217;re seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it comes to PC handhelds, so it&#8217;s really interesting to see them be one of the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt they will do more and other vendors will follow along. ↫ Liam Dawe It was inevitable for SteamOS to spread beyond just the Steam Deck, but an important note to make here is that Ayaneo is not working together with Valve. Instead, they&#8217;re using HoloIso, one of the community-maintained variants of SteamOS anyone can use and install. I&#8217;m a bit surprised by this, since moving SteamOS beyond just Valve products in an official capacity seems like a no-brainer for Valve; they&#8217;re not really in it for the hardware money, after all, and instead earn their money from Steam game sales. I&#8217;m fairly convinced this isn&#8217;t the last time we&#8217;re seeing a non-Valve product with SteamOS, but I&#8217;d rather have Valve involved in the process before spending any money on one of these.

## Does More Renewable Energy Lead to More Political Support? Not in Texas.

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA1ODAzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTU4MTg5MX0.pekYjhPN9c6VOfUt2ruzZ3ZUj2k9MWcqMiKYwEzjLpg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">One of the central conceits of the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s landmark climate legislation, is that green investment will eventually lead to bipartisan support for the law. No Republican may have crossed the aisle to support the IRA in 2022, but when money flows into red districts, conservatives will come around. Or so the thinking goes.</p><p>The reality is proving more complicated. Some academic research has indeed suggested that investments in the climate economy can lead to positive political feedback. There have also been notable examples of conservative politicians supporting factories that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/clean-energy-gop-red-states.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produce batteries</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/11/marjorie-taylor-greene-district-climate-biden-00104848" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. But our home state of Texas provides a more cautionary tale, particularly when it comes to the generation of renewable energy itself.</p><p>At the University of Texas at Austin, we recently conducted a study that investigated how unprecedented investment in the state’s clean energy industry has affected legislation. To put it bluntly, the results were the opposite of what renewable advocates would hope to see.</p><p>After winter storm Uri battered Texas in 2021, leading to major power outages, Republicans in the Texas state legislature introduced numerous bills to address what they claimed was the major culprit: renewable energy. (Democrats blamed fossil fuels.) Wind and solar had grown exponentially in recent years, turning Texas into the first and second largest state for their provision respectively. Nevertheless, along with bills to increase gas power production and reliability, Republicans targeted renewable energy for increased regulation, higher fees, and outright construction bans. Labeled the <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-republican-war-on-renewable-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“War on Renewables”,</a> some of these policies were called “industry killers” by renewable energy advocates. The majority of these bills were introduced in the Texas Senate.</p><p>Senate Bill 7 and Senate Bill 1287 both proposed new fees for wind and solar projects. Senate Bill 2012 would lead to charges on renewable projects to help fund the building of gas plants, and Senate Bill 2015 would require half of all generation in Texas to come from non-renewable sources. Perhaps the most damaging of bills would have led to a new permitting process that only applied to renewable energy generation (SB 624). Most of these bills passed the Texas Senate but didn’t receive a vote in the Texas House.</p><p>We analyzed the relationship between voting on these Senate bills and renewable energy investments in legislators’ districts. Of the 31 Texas Senate districts, seven have considerable wind investments and 12 have solar projects built or proposed.</p><p>Interestingly, many of the urban Democratic districts have little or no renewable energy projects. That’s probably because utility-scale wind and solar requires not only wind and sun, but available land. This land is often found in rural areas that are the strongholds of the Republican Party.</p><p>First, we present the major renewable energy bills and the partisan voting on this legislation. The pattern is clear. SB 258, one of the few pro-renewable bills, received full support from Democratic senators. Anti-renewable bills were introduced by Republican senators and they received overwhelming support from their party. Conversely, few Democrats supported these bills in what amounts to extremely partisan voting.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>This partisan pattern is unsurprising on the surface, but economic interests can also drive voting on renewable energy policy. How did renewable energy investment shape voting on these bills?</p><p>The Advanced Power Association, arguably the most powerful renewable energy association in Texas, provides a <a href="https://txrenewables.net/" target="_blank">map</a> on their website of renewable energy investments by Senate and House district in Texas. This underlying data, complied by IdeaSmiths and shared with us by Josh Rhodes, is the same data that can be accessed by legislators on the impact of renewable energy in their districts. This data includes solar, wind, and renewable energy story investments, proposed investments, and estimated local tax revenues from these projects. For simplicity we present total megawatts of proposed, under construction, and built wind and solar projects, but we note the patterns we identify are consistent with different codings of this data.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0d3ccbe453327becc02dc2789e7db67e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a7569" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyOTU1OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTEzMzMwNH0.etyX7ab7Ag1B7QE4pmW2zEuKBALk_nXVNQ_9AqUIGHk/image.png?width=980"/>
</p><p>The lack of correlation between renewable energy investment and voting on renewable legislation is striking. Politicians voting against renewable energy here actually had more wind and solar investment and greater estimated tax revenues from renewables in their districts. In fact, many of the <em>authors</em> of the anti-renewable bills have some of the largest renewable investments in the state. Meanwhile, SB 258, one of the few pro-renewable bills, received greater support from districts with fewer renewable energy projects. Our interpretation is simply that renewable energy investment has no impact on renewable energy voting.<br/></p><p>How can that be? We offer three possible explanations.</p><p>The first, and most unlikely, is that fossil fuel interests are driving this war on renewables. While plausible, this explanation is forced to confront the fact that <a target="_blank"></a><a href="https://theconversation.com/who-benefits-from-renewable-energy-subsidies-in-texas-its-often-fossil-fuel-companies-that-are-fighting-clean-energy-elsewhere-187832" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the majority of renewable energy projects in these areas are actually owned by fossil fuel owners.</a> In a <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4266894/003BBCA6C84D07EB1748BE72AD150E1A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roundtable</a> recapping this previous legislative session, renewable energy advocates, including the Advanced Power Alliance, directly stated that they didn’t think this legislation was driven by fossil fuel interests.</p><p>The second, which feels more likely, is that renewable energy generation isn’t leading to the kinds of jobs or government revenue that can insulate it from danger. Most of these projects have received considerable tax abatements from cities, counties, and local school districts, limiting their positive fiscal impact. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They also employ </a><a href="https://graham.umich.edu/media/pubs/Wind-Turbine-Economic-Impact-Local-Employment-46932.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relatively few workers</a> once construction is complete. For example, the most recent Texas application for school tax abatements is Skull Creek Solar’s $147-million solar energy project. In their <a href="https://assets.comptroller.texas.gov/ch313/1963/1963-cayuga-skull-app.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">application for school tax abatements</a>, they propose the creation of one job. If these projects are generating little tax revenue and few jobs, of course skeptical politicians might be indifferent to their fates. In contrast, other green investments, such as electric vehicle assembly and supply chains, can create thousands of jobs.</p><p>The third, and most likely of all, is that renewable energy has simply become another front in America’s ever-widening culture war. And the partisan passage of the IRA may have exacerbated the divide.</p><p>Now, our data analysis examines one state and alternative dynamics might be at play in other places. But given the depth of renewable energy investment in Texas and the waves of anti-renewable legislation in renewable energy districts, our analysis suggests limits to the relationship between renewable energy investment and politics.</p><p>Hopes that green energy investments in Republican districts will lead to changes in voting on renewable energy are inconsistent with our findings in Texas.</p>

## January 10, 2024

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

The Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives was back in session for business today. The day&#8217;s events did not bode well for the House&#8217;s managing to accomplish more in 2024 than it did in 2023. Top on the list of things that must get done, and done fast, is funding the government. The continuing resolution currently in place to fund the government expires in two phases: one on January 19 and the other on February 2. The far-right Freedom Caucus Republicans have refused to agree to funding measures without far deeper cuts than former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) agreed to in a long-ago deal with President Joe Biden as part of a package to raise the debt ceiling until 2025. They also want to attach far-right cultural demands to the measures, although traditionally appropriations are kept clean.

## Blinken Wraps Up Latest Middle East Tour; Says Gaza Conflict Has to End

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday Israel working with Arab neighbors in the Middle East region to pave the way for a Palestinian state is the most effective way to isolate Iran. 


Before leaving Cairo, where he held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Blinken said, “There’s a path that brings Israel’s needs and desires for integration in the region and genuine security with, as well, Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own.”


“That’s the single best way – this integration, security, a Palestinian state – to isolate and marginalize Iran and the kinds of actions it’s taking through its proxies,” Blinken said. “I think that vision is clear but for us to move on it, for it to really get started, the conflict in Gaza has to end. That’s critical.”


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has firmly rejected the two-state solution.


Cairo was the 10th and final stop on Blinken’s seven-day diplomatic mission, focused on containing the Gaza war, increasing humanitarian assistance, ensuring the protection of civilians, and securing the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas militants.


Earlier on Thursday, Blinken expressed appreciation for Egypt’s partnership in assisting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. 


“Secretary Blinken and President El Sissi discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages.  The secretary reiterated U.S. commitment to ensuring Palestinians in Gaza are not forcibly displaced and to achieving regional peace that ensures Israel’s security and advances the establishment of a Palestinian state,” according to the State Department.


Egypt played a key role in mediating an earlier temporary cease-fire during which Hamas released more than 100 hostages and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Egypt is trying to revive hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas.


Retired General Kenneth "Frank" McKenzie, former commander of U.S. Central Command, expressed pessimism during a webinar on Wednesday.


"I think it's going to be very hard to get the remaining hostages back. ... They're the last thing Hamas has," he said. "I am not optimistic that we're going to get a lot of these hostages back."


Thursday’s talks in Cairo come a day after Blinken met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank, and Abbas held subsequent talks with Sissi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II.


The Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian leaders issued a joint statement calling for the international community to maintain pressure for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and for the protection of Palestinian civilians. The leaders also highlighted the need for displaced Palestinians to be able to return to their homes in Gaza, and they rejected any attempt by Israel to reoccupy parts of the territory after the war.


Netanyahu said during televised remarks late Wednesday that Israel “has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”


"Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law," he said.


Israel has agreed to allow a United Nations mission to evaluate the situation in war-ravaged northern Gaza for the safe return of displaced Palestinians.


Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Wednesday that the mission is "contingent on security guarantees" from Israel.


The U.N. hopes to carry it out as soon as possible, as it is critical to a planned increase in humanitarian aid for northern Gaza.


Diplomats said Israel has invited U.N. Security Council members to visit the country later this month.


A U.N. special envoy is also set to conduct a mission to Israel and the West Bank at the end of January to gather information on sexual violence against hostages, reportedly committed by Hamas militants during the October 7 attacks in southern Israel, and the aftermath.


More than 85% of Palestinians have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since October 7, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.


Red Sea attacks


Blinken on Wednesday warned of "consequences" after Yemen-based Houthi rebels launched their largest yet aerial attack on the Red Sea.


"We had the biggest attack — UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] missiles — just yesterday," Blinken told reporters at Bahrain International Airport in Manama on Wednesday. "These attacks have been aided and abetted by Iran with technology, equipment, intelligence, information, and they are having a real-life impact on people."


More than 20 countries, including Bahrain, have pledged to preserve freedom of navigation and freedom of shipping in the Red Sea, Blinken said after holding talks with Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.


"If these attacks continue as they did yesterday, there will be consequences," Blinken added. He urged Iran to stop its assistance to Houthis but declined to elaborate on what specific consequences there would be.


On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution condemning and demanding an end to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea.


The Iran-backed Houthis said the attacks target ships affiliated with or bound for Israel, and that they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.


Gaza health officials say more than 23,400 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.


Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel in October. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack.


Some material for this report came from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.

## ‘Green’ Is the New Republican Dirty Word

date: 2024-01-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA1NzA2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDYyNTA3NX0.8ajU4l0fti4GUekmxT_jLDptKkLgyVN5MChDdz6culQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Our condolences to “woke.” It appears that Republicans have a new favorite boogeyman buzzword this election season: “green.” The word was on every Republican presidential hopeful’s lips on Wednesday, both at CNN’s debate in Iowa between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and at former President Donald Trump’s competing town hall on Fox News.</p><p>To start, DeSantis reiterated his promise to reverse President Biden’s clean energy policy – without, of course, actually calling it by its real name. After explaining that energy independence is “good to reduce inflation,” DeSantis continued, “So we’ll do that on day one and we’re going to reverse Biden’s Green New Deal and the electric vehicle mandates.” DeSantis is of course facetiously referring to the Inflation Reduction Act here — Biden has <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21498236/joe-biden-green-new-deal-debate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not supported</a> the actual Green New Deal as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/climate-green-new-deal-tour-ed-markey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed</a> in a resolution by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey in 2019.</p><p>It’s also not the first time DeSantis has made this particular reference. The Florida governor, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/ron-desantis-environment-climate-change" target="_self">who once said</a> that “humans contribute to what goes on around us” while running for governor in Florida in 2018, promised that he’d be “taking all the Biden regulations, the Green New Deal, ripping it up and throwing it in the trash can where it belongs,” at November’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1722436851322036597" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primary debate</a>. DeSantis’s environmental flip-flopping has not gone unnoticed by his opponents – least of all Haley, who called out DeSantis’s pledge to ban fracking during Wednesday’s debate, as she did in <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">September</a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">November</a> as well.</p><p>Haley took her own stab at Biden’s energy policy shortly after DeSantis at Wednesday’s debate. Biden’s “green subsidies” caught a stray during Haley’s answer to a question about funding Ukraine and Israel during their respective ongoing wars. “Supporting Ukraine is 3.5% of our budget,” Haley said. “If we support Ukraine and Israel, that's only 5% of our defense budget [...] If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the border, that's less than 20% of Biden's green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security." </p><p>For his part, Trump trotted out a predictably insane “green” reference during his live town hall on Fox News. While answering a question about contributing to the national debt during his term, Trump said, “You had to inject money. … If I didn’t do that, you would have had a depression in this country.” He continued, “That was a very good investment. And now what they should be doing instead of the kind of debt that they’re building at record levels, they should be paying down their debt and they ought to go into the energy business instead of this green new scam business that they’re in.”</p><p>It’s perhaps redundant to note that at no point during the fifth Republican presidential debate or Trump’s town hall was the Inflation Reduction Act mentioned by name. We’ll have to tune into the next debate (January 18 in New Hampshire) to find out if the green verbal tic holds up.</p>

## House Republicans Aim to Impeach US Homeland Secretary

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington    — House Republicans held their first impeachment hearing Wednesday against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of what they called the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.


In a 20-minute opening statement, Mark Green, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, shared what he said was evidence that supports impeaching a Cabinet secretary.


"Secretary Mayorkas has brazenly refused to enforce the laws passed by Congress that knowingly made our country less safe," he said.


Republicans blame Mayorkas for the high numbers of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the Republican Party has undertaken a yearlong investigation into the secretary’s work.


During the hearing, Green said Mayorkas' failure to adhere to the law provides ample justification for initiating impeachment proceedings. The lawmaker said the framers of the constitution did not envision impeachment solely for criminal acts but also for individuals displaying significant incompetence, jeopardizing fellow Americans, breaching public trust, or neglecting their duties.


"What we are seeing here is a willful violation of his oath of office by Secretary Mayorkas," Green said.


Democrats dismissed the impeachment efforts.


Representative Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the committee, said Republicans want to "throw political red meat to their base," adding that Republicans have "absolutely no basis" to impeach Mayorkas.


"You cannot impeach a Cabinet secretary because you don’t like a president’s policies — that’s not what impeachment is for," he said.


US-Mexico border


Meanwhile, Mayorkas has carried on with his duties. On Monday, he visited the border at Eagle Pass, Texas, to see Southwest border enforcement efforts.


His visit came after federal border officials reported a record 11,000 apprehensions a day at the southern border in December alone. These encounters dropped sharply with the beginning of the new year.


"It coincided with the time when Mexican enforcement was no longer implemented. The immigration enforcement agency in Mexico was not funded, which prompted President [Joe] Biden to reconnect with [Mexican] President [Andres Manual Lopez] Obrador …" Mayorkas told reporters.


The high numbers of migrants encountered at the southern border is one of the Republicans’ arguments to impeach the DHS secretary.


In year 2023, about 2.5 million migrants were encountered by border patrol officers. Out of those, 564,380 were expelled under Title 42, a public health code that expired on May 11, 2023. It was used during the pandemic and allowed U.S. immigration officials to quickly expel migrants to their country of origin or Mexican border towns and denied them a chance at asylum.


But it did not ban them from trying again, and migrants were counted multiple times under Title 42.


According to DHS, the department repatriated about 469,000 migrants in fiscal 2023, while about 909,450 more were processed by border patrol officials and received a document to present themselves at an Immigration Customs Enforcement office. Some of those were paroled into the U.S. and allowed to stay temporarily or paroled into the alternative to detention program. And 311,343 more migrants were transferred to an ICE detention facility.


Since the end of Title 42, everyone is again processed under Title 8, the federal code of laws dealing with immigration. Those arriving at the border without documents or trying to enter between ports of entry can be removed without their case being decided by an immigration court through a process known as expedited removal, and they are banned from entering the U.S. for at least five years.


While in Texas, Mayorkas said that migrants encountered at the border who do not have a legal basis to stay in the U.S. will be removed.


Next steps


Impeaching the Homeland Security secretary would be a rare occurrence. In U.S. history, only one Cabinet official, Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876, has been impeached.


The committee is expected to host more hearings as part of the impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas. Once concluded, the panel is expected to conduct a markup on articles of impeachment that will culminate in a committee vote, setting the stage for the articles to be subsequently forwarded to the full House for consideration.


Mayorkas, however, is not expected to be removed by the Senate.

## Trying to be the ideal American family with a small fridge

date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m coming to the realization when you’re a family with a small fridge you cannot be all these platonic ideals at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The buy in bulk Costco family</li>
<li>The big weekly shopping trip family</li>
<li>The cook/order extra and eat leftovers family</li>
<li>The cook extra and freeze it family</li>
<li>The meal prep family</li>
<li>The freezer full of frozen smoothie ingredients family</li>
<li>The buy one-off condiments, sauces, or pickles family</li>
<li>The keep fresh fruits and veggies on hand family</li>
<li>The make my kids lunches family</li>
</ul>
<p>At best you can be one of these or buy a garage fridge. People with two fridges seem content. Some industrious folks keep a whole deer or half a cow in there. I’m not going that overboard, I need a home for a bag of chicken nuggies, tamales from Arizona, and some ice cream.</p>
<p>Interesting predicament, small fridges. Instagram Reel-esque lifehacks could save my family some real money, reduce waste, and make food choices more healthy or interesting. I don’t want an extra fridge humming in the garage getting slimy, but I also don’t want to go to the store every other day. Good grief, Charlie Brown.</p>

## Trump Critic Christie Says He's Ending Presidential Bid

date: 2024-01-11, from: VOA News USA

WINDHAM, New Hampshire — Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said Wednesday that he was ending his Republican presidential bid just days before Iowa's leadoff caucuses. 


"My goal has never been to be just a voice against the hate and division and the selfishness of what our party has become under Donald Trump," Christie said at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire. 


"I've always said that if there came a point in time in this race where I couldn't see a path to accomplishing that goal, that I would get out," he said. "And it's clear to me tonight that there isn't a path for me to win the nomination, which is why I'm suspending my campaign tonight for president of the United States." 


It wasn't clear whether Christie would be immediately endorsing one of his rivals, but he was overheard criticizing former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on a livestream set up by his campaign ahead of the event. 


"She's going to get smoked," he said. "She's not up to this."  


He said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called him, petrified he would endorse Haley, but the hot mic was cut before Christie finished speaking. 


Counting on New Hampshire


The dropout came as a surprise, given that Christie had staked the success of his campaign on New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, which is less than two weeks away. He had insisted as recently as Tuesday night that he had no plans to leave the race, continuing to cast himself as the only candidate willing to directly take on the former president. 


"I would be happy to get out of the way for someone who is actually running against Donald Trump," he said at a town hall session in Rochester, New Hampshire, while arguing that none of his rivals had taken on the former president.




But Christie faced a stark reality: While recent polls showed him reaching the double digits in New Hampshire, Haley shows signs of momentum. A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll conducted in the state this week found Trump's lead down to the single digits, with four in 10 likely Republican primary voters choosing Trump and about one-third choosing Haley. 


Allies of Haley, including New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and other anti-Trump Republicans, had been urging Christie to exit, hoping a large portion of his supporters would flock to Haley, giving her a chance to turn the race into a two-candidate contest with Trump, the overwhelming favorite for the nomination. 


The New Hampshire poll — which showed Christie at 12% — found about two-thirds of his supporters would select Haley as their second choice. 


Christie had run as the race's fiercest critic of the former president. He warned voters against nominating a candidate who has been criminally indicted four times and could very well be a convicted felon by the November general election. And he argued Trump would lose in a rematch with President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee. 


While his anti-Trump message attracted much media attention and helped bring in waves of small-dollar donations that kept him in the race — and on the debate stage — far longer than many expected, Christie was plagued by high unfavorability ratings in a party that remains deeply loyal to Trump. 


He also remained mired in the single digits in national polling. 


Frugal campaign


Nonetheless, Christie managed to outlast far better-known and better-funded candidates, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, in part because he ran a frugal campaign. Instead of flying by private jet and hiring a litany of expensive consultants, he relied on a tight-knit staff of just over a dozen people and spent far lower per day than rivals like DeSantis. 


And just as he did when he ran in 2016, Christie banked his campaign on New Hampshire, believing his brash "tell it like it is" style would resonate with the state's more independent-leaning voters, including those who are unaffiliated with a party and can vote in the Republican primary. 


He also campaigned in South Carolina and hoped to emerge as the last man standing against Trump after the early state contests. 


Christie had long insisted that he had no plans to leave the race before New Hampshire's primary on January 23 and appeared on track to perform better than he had in 2016, when he finished in sixth place with just 7% of the vote. 


At the town hall Tuesday, he delivered a sharply worded rebuttal to those calling on him to drop out to clear the path for Haley, arguing that she wasn't even trying to beat the front-runner. 


"I have no interest in being a spoiler for someone who wants to beat Donald Trump," he said. "But if you'd be willing to be his vice president? If you'd pardon him if you became president? If you'd vote for him even if he's a convicted felon ... I mean, geez, really?" 


Christie asked the crowd to imagine what would happen if he dropped out to support Haley and then she agreed to serve as Trump's running mate. 


"What will I look like? What will all the people who supported her at my behest look like?" he asked. "You know, I made that mistake once eight years ago. I made an endorsement decision based on politics eight years ago when I supported Trump. I'm not going to make the same mistake again. Can't do it." 


Once a Trump asset


The campaign in many ways felt like a mission of redemption for the former governor, who arguably did more than any other Republican to help Trump win the presidency when they faced each other in 2016. 


During that contest, Christie delivered a fatal blow to rival candidate Marco Rubio during a debate that came just as the Republican establishment appeared to be coalescing around the senator from Florida as a Trump alternative. No other candidate ever emerged in his place. 


Then, after Christie dropped out, he became the first major Republican figure to endorse Trump during a surprise press conference. He went on to lead Trump's White House transition operation — before he was unceremoniously fired — and to serve as an on-again-off-again adviser, including preparing Trump for the debates against Biden. 


It was during one of their 2020 debate prep sessions that Christie believes Trump gave him COVID-19, putting Christie in the hospital in intensive care. 


But it wasn't until the night of the 2020 election that Christie, who had been friends with Trump and his wife for 20 years, broke with the then-president after Trump falsely claimed victory long before all the votes had been counted. Christie later penned a book that was deeply critical of the former president. 


Beyond his focus on Trump, Christie had argued that abortion restrictions should be left to the states until there is broader consensus on the issue, and he had advocated for continued U.S. support for Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia's invasion. He visited both Ukraine and Israel, where he toured a kibbutz that was ravaged in the October 7 rampage by Hamas militants and said the U.S. must stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Israel.

## The effect and mechanism of Fushen Granule on gut microbiome in the prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Fushen Granule is an improved granule based on the classic formula Fushen Formula, which is used for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related intestinal dysfunction in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the effect and mechanism of this granule on the prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure have not been fully elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A 5/6 nephrectomy model of CRF was induced and Fushen Granule was administered at low and high doses to observe its effects on renal function, D-lactate, serum endotoxin, and intestinal-derived metabolic toxins. The 16SrRNA sequencing method was used to analyze the abundance and structure of the intestinal flora of CRF rats. A FMT assay was also used to evaluate the effects of transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal bacteria on renal-related functional parameters and metabolic toxins in CRF rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Gavage administration of Fushen Granule at low and high doses down-regulated creatinine, urea nitrogen, 24-h urine microalbumin, D-lactate, endotoxin, and the intestinal-derived toxins indophenol sulphateand p-cresol sulphate in CRF rats. Compared with the sham-operated group in the same period, CRF rats had a decreased abundance of the firmicutes phylum and an increased abundance of the bacteroidetes phylum at the phylum level, and a decreasing trend of the lactobacillus genus at the genus level. Fushen Granule intervention increased the abundance of the firmicutes phylum, decreased the abundance of the bacteroidetes phylum, and increased the abundance of the lactobacillus genus. The transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal bacteria significantly reduced creatinine(Cr), blood urea nitrogen(Bun), uric acid(UA), 24-h urinary microalbumin, D-lactate, serum endotoxin, and enterogenic metabolic toxins in CRF rats. Compared with the sham-operated group, the transplantation of Fushen Granule fecal bacteria modulated the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla and the Lactobacillus genus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fushen Granule improved renal function and intestinal barrier function by regulating intestinal flora, inhibiting renal fibrosis, and delaying the progression of chronic renal failure.</p></sec>

## Will previous antimicrobial therapy reduce the positivity rate of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in periprosthetic joint infections? A clinical study

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a culture-independent massively parallel DNA sequencing technology and it has been widely used for rapid etiological diagnosis with significantly high positivity rate. Currently, clinical studies on evaluating the influence of previous antimicrobial therapy on positivity rate of mNGS in PJIs are rarely reported. The present study aimed to investigate whether the positivity rate of mNGS is susceptible to previous antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a prospective trial among patients who undergone hip or knee surgery due to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) to compare the positivity rate of culture and mNGS between cases with and without previous antimicrobial therapy, and the positivity rates between cases with different antimicrobial-free intervals were also analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among 131 included PJIs, 91 (69.5%) had positive cultures and 115 (87.8%) had positive mNGS results. There was no significant difference in the positivity rate of deep-tissue culture and synovial fluid mNGS between cases with and without previous antimicrobial therapy. The positivity rate of synovial fluid culture was higher in cases with previous antimicrobial therapy. The positivity rates of mNGS in synovial fluid decreased as the antimicrobial-free interval ranged from 4 to 14 days to 0 to 3 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>mNGS is more advantageous than culture with a higher pathogen detection rate. However, our data suggested that antimicrobial agents may need to be discontinued more than 3 days before sampling to further increase the positivity rate of mNGS for PJIs.</p></sec>

## Characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in IncX3 plasmids and the rare In1765 in an IncFIB-IncHI1B plasmid

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Today, the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> gene is widely distributed on several plasmids from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, primarily in transposons and gene cassettes within their multidrug-resistant (MDR) regions. This has led to the global dissemination of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM</sub> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The determination of class A beta-lactamase, class B and D carbapenemases was performed according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using both the BioMerieux VITEK2 system and antibiotic paper diffusion methods. Plasmid transfer was then evaluated by conjugation experiments and plasmid electroporation assays. To comprehensively analyze the complete genome of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain F11 and to investigate the presence of mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms were used, and bioinformatics methods were applied to analyze the obtained data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our findings revealed that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain F11 carried class A beta-lactamase and classes B+D carbapenemases, and exhibited resistance to commonly used antibiotics, particularly tigecycline and ceftazidime/avibactam, due to the presence of relevant resistance genes. Plasmid transfer assays demonstrated successful recovery of plasmids pA_F11 and pB_F11, with average conjugation frequencies of 2.91×10<sup>-4</sup> and 1.56×10<sup>-4</sup>, respectively. However, plasmids pC_F11 and pD_F11 failed in both conjugation and electroporation experiments. The MDR region of plasmid pA_F11 contained rare In1765, Tn<italic>As2</italic>, and Tn<italic>As3</italic> elements. The MDR2 region of plasmid pB_F11 functioned as a mobile genetic “island” and lacked the <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> gene, serving as a “bridge” connecting the early composite structure of <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> and <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> to the recent composite structure. Additionally, the MDR1 region of plasmid pB_F11 comprised In27, Tn<italic>As1</italic>, Tn<italic>As3</italic>, and Tn<italic>2</italic>; and plasmid pC_F11 harbored the recent composite structure of <italic>ble</italic><sub>MBL</sub> and <italic>bla</italic><sub>NDM-1</sub> within Tn<italic>3000</italic> which partially contained partial Tn<italic>125</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that complex combinations of transposons and integron overlaps, along with the synergistic effects of different drug resistance and virulence genes, led to a lack of effective therapeutic agents for strain F11, therefore its dissemination and prevalence should be strictly controlled.</p></sec>

## Transcriptional profiling specifies the pathogen-specific human host response to infectious keratitis

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Purpose</title><p>Corneal infections are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Here we applied high-resolution transcriptomic profiling to assess the general and pathogen-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms during human corneal infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Clinical diagnoses of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n=5) and bacterial/fungal (n=5) keratitis were confirmed by histology. Healthy corneas (n=7) and keratoconus (n=4) samples served as controls. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human corneal specimens were analyzed using the 3’ RNA sequencing method Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE RNA-seq). The cellular host response was investigated using comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell and CYBERSORTx) analyses and by integration with published single cell RNA-seq data of the human cornea.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our analysis identified 216 and 561 genes, that were specifically overexpressed in viral or bacterial/fungal keratitis, respectively, and allowed to distinguish the two etiologies. The virus-specific host response was driven by adaptive immunity and associated molecular signaling pathways, whereas the bacterial/fungal-specific host response mainly involved innate immunity signaling pathways and cell types. We identified several genes and pathways involved in the host response to infectious keratitis, including CXCL9, CXCR3, and MMP9 for viral, and S100A8/A9, MMP9, and the IL17 pathway for bacterial/fungal keratitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>High-resolution molecular profiling provides new insights into the human corneal host response to viral and bacterial/fungal infection. Pathogen-specific molecular profiles may provide the foundation for novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic approaches that target inflammation-induced damage to corneal host cells with the goal to improve the outcome of infectious keratitis.</p></sec>

## Potential roles of Culicoides spp. (Culicoides imicola, Culicoides oxystoma) as biological vectors of bluetongue virus in Yuanyang of Yunnan, P. R. China

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Culicoides</italic> plays a crucial role as an insect vector in the field of veterinary medicine. The transmission of significant viruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV) by this insect poses a substantial threat, leading to the development of severe diseases in domestic animals. This study aimed to explore the <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, identify their blood-meal sources, and assess the presence of BTV and AHSV carried by <italic>Culicoides</italic> in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Province. The aim was to gain insights into the potential vectors of these two viruses and elucidate their potential roles in the transmission of pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The midges were collected from cattle (<italic>Bos indicus</italic>), pig (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), and goat (<italic>Capra hircus</italic>) pens in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Province in June 2020. Initial identification of midges was conducted through morphological characteristics, followed by molecular identification using the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The determination of <italic>Culicoides</italic> blood-meal sources was accomplished using specific primers targeting the cytochrome <italic>b</italic> (Cyt <italic>b</italic>) gene from potential hosts. BTV and AHSV RNA were identified in <italic>Culicoides</italic> pools through the application of reverse transcriptase PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis were performed using MegAlign (DNAStar) and Mega 6.0 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 6,300 <italic>Culicoides</italic>, consisting of <italic>C. oxystoma, C. arakawai, C. imicola</italic>, and <italic>C. innoxius</italic>, were collected from cattle, pigs, and goat pens. The engorgement rates for these species were 30.2%, 54.6%, 75%, and 66.7%, respectively. In the cattle pen, the prevailing species is <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> (100%). In the pig pen, <italic>C. arakawai </italic> dominates (70%), with <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> following at 30%. In the goat pen, <italic>C. imicola</italic> holds the majority (45.45%), trailed by <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> (25%), <italic>C. innoxius</italic> (20.45%), and <italic>C. arakawai</italic> (9.09%). These <italic>Culicoides</italic> species were identified as feeding on cattle, pigs, goats, chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), and humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>). The positivity rates for BTV were 20.00% and 11.54% in blood-fed specimens of <italic>C. imicola</italic> and <italic>C. oxystoma</italic>, respectively. Conversely, the positivity rates for BTV in non-blood-fed specimens were 0.00% and 6.67% for <italic>C. imicola</italic> and <italic>C. oxystoma</italic>, respectively. BTV was not detected in <italic>C. arakawai</italic> and <italic>C. innoxius</italic>. The specimens (YY86) from <italic>C. imicola</italic> that tested positive for BTV had the closest genetic relationship to YTS-4 isolated from Mangshi, Yunnan Province in 1996. All test results for the nucleic acid of AHSV were negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study reveals variations in the species distribution, community composition, blood sucking rate, and blood-feeding sources of <italic>Culicoides</italic> across different habitats. Notably, <italic>C. imicola</italic> and <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> emerge as potential vectors for the transmission of BTV in local animals. Accordingly, this investigation provides crucial insights that can serve as a valuable reference for the prevention and control of BTV in local animals, particularly from the perspective of vector management.</p></sec>

## Endogenous retroviruses Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 as innovative prognostic biomarkers in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Emerging evidence has proven that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), whereas the specific HERVs influencing the prognosis of AML patients have yet to be fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, a systematic exploration was achieved to identify potential prognostic HERVs for AML, sourced from TCGA and GTEx database. Differential analysis and functional enrichment studies were conducted using GO, KEGG, GSEA, and GSVA. The ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to explore the immune infiltration of HERVs in AML. A prognostic risk-score model was evaluated with predicted yearly accuracy using ROC analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two HERVs Suppressyn and Syncytin-2, were identified as promising prognostic biomarkers, with high discrimination ability based on ROC analysis between AML and healthy cohorts from TCGA. Their expression was notably higher in AML patients compared to those in healthy individuals but correlates with favorable clinical outcomes in sub-groups such as white race, lower WBC counts, favorable and intermediate risks, and NPM1 or IDH1 mutation. Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 participated in immune-related pathways and exhibited correlations with multiple immune infiltration cells, such as T cells, mast cells, and tumor-associated macrophages. Finally, we developed a prognostic risk-scoring model combining Suppressyn and Syncytin-2, where a high risk-score is associated with better prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Collectively, our findings revealed that Suppressyn and Syncytin-2 may act as valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for individuals with AML, while highlighting links between HERV activation, immunogenicity, and future therapeutic targets.</p></sec>

## A guide to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia virulence capabilities, as we currently understand them

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>The Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> causes a wide range of human infections. It causes particularly serious lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis, leading to high mortality rates. This pathogen is resistant to most known antibiotics and harbors a plethora of virulence factors, including lytic enzymes and serine proteases, that cause acute infection in host organisms. <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> also establishes chronic infections through biofilm formation. The biofilm environment protects the bacteria from external threats and harsh conditions and is therefore vital for the long-term pathogenesis of the microbe. While studies have identified several genes that mediate <italic>S. maltophilia’s</italic> initial colonization and biofilm formation, the cascade of events initiated by these factors is poorly understood. Consequently, understanding these and other virulence factors can yield exciting new targets for novel therapeutics.</p>

## DNA damage response coregulator ddrR affects many cellular pathways and processes in Acinetobacter baumannii 17978

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> strain 17978 is an opportunistic pathogen possessing a DNA damage response (DDR) in which multiple error-prone polymerase genes are co-repressed by a UmuD homolog, UmuDAb, and the small <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>-specific protein DdrR. Additionally, these regulators coactivate nine other genes. We identified the DNA damage-inducible transcriptome for wildtype, <italic>umuDAb</italic>, and <italic>recA</italic> strains, and later established the <italic>ddrR</italic> DDR transcriptome. However, the ATCC 17978 reference genome had several assembly errors and lacked the 44 kb virulence locus, AbaAL44, that is present in the strain 17978 UN.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>For this project, we combined our earlier single-end read RNAseq data with the <italic>ddrR</italic> paired-end reads and aligned these data to the improved 17978 UN genome assembly that resembled our laboratory strain, 17978 JH.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>New DESeq2 analyses verified previous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) but also found 339 genes in 17978 JH that were not annotated or physically present in the older genome assembly. Sixty-three were differentially expressed after DNA damage, and 182 had differential basal expression when comparing <italic>umuDAb</italic>, <italic>ddrR</italic>, or <italic>recA</italic> strains to wildtype, with 94 genes’ expression unchanged. This work identified and characterized the 55 gene DNA damage-repressible transcriptome, 98% of which required either <italic>umuDAb</italic> or <italic>ddrR</italic> for repression. Two-thirds of these DEGs required both regulators. We also identified 110 genes repressed only in the <italic>ddrR</italic> strain, ~50% of which were due to increased basal expression levels. Basal gene expression in the <italic>ddrR</italic> mutant was further dysregulated independent of the DDR. Over 800 genes were upregulated, and over 1200 genes were downregulated compared to wildtype expression. Half of <italic>A. baumannii’s</italic> essential genes were upregulated in the <italic>ddrR</italic> strain, including cell division genes, and two-thirds of these were downregulated in the <italic>umuDAb</italic> strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>ddrR</italic> mutant upregulated genes enriched in translation, RNA metabolism, protein metabolism, AA/FA/cell-structure synthesis, and transport, while downregulating genes enriched in quorum sensing, biofilm production, secretion systems, pilus production, cell adhesion, and aromatics and chlorine degradation. Our data underscore the need for accurate and appropriately matched genome assemblies and indicate that <italic>ddrR</italic> affects approximately 60% of the genome, rendering it a potential target for <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> infection treatment.</p></sec>

## Urine microbiome in individuals with an impaired immune system

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>With the advent of next generation sequencing, it is now appreciated that human urine is not sterile. Recent investigations of the urinary microbiome (urobiome) have provided insights into several urological diseases. Urobiome dysbiosis, defined as non-optimal urine microbiome composition, has been observed in many disorders; however, it is not clear whether this dysbiosis is the cause of urinary tract disorders or a consequence. In addition, immunologically altered disorders are associated with higher rates of urinary tract infections. These disorders include immunoproliferative and immunodeficiency diseases, cancer, and immunosuppressant therapy in transplant recipients. In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge of the urobiome in immunologically altered diseases, its composition and metabolomic consequences. We conclude that more data are required to describe the urobiome in immune altered states, knowledge that could facilitate understanding the role of the urobiome and its pathophysiological effects on  urinary tract infections and other disorders of the urinary tract.</p>

## Streptomyces albireticuli lung infection managed as a pulmonary air cyst: a case report and literature review

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Streptomyces</italic>, the largest genus in the <italic>Streptomycetaceae</italic> family and a prolific producer of antibacterial drugs, is a saprophytic soil organism that rarely causes invasive infections. Here we report a case of necrotic pneumonia caused by <italic>Streptomyces albireticuli</italic> in a 75-year-old man who presented with progressive chest tightness and dyspnea. <italic>Streptomyces albireticuli</italic> was isolated from his bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and identified through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis. The patient responded satisfactorily to clarithromycin therapy. The findings of this study may enhance our vigilance in identifying visceral infections caused by <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p>

## Lysosomal trafficking regulator restricts intracellular growth of Coxiella burnetii by inhibiting the expansion of Coxiella-containing vacuole and upregulating nos2 expression

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes Q fever, a zoonotic disease typically manifests as a severe flu-illness. After invading into the host cells, <italic>C. burnetii</italic> delivers effectors to regulate the vesicle trafficking and fusion events to form a large and mature <italic>Coxiella</italic>-containing vacuole (CCV), providing sufficient space and nutrition for its intracellular growth and proliferation. Lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) is a member of the Beige and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (BEACH) family, which regulates the transport of vesicles to lysosomes and regulates TLR signaling pathway, but the effect of LYST on <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection is unclear. In this study, a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the influence of LYST on intracellular growth of <italic>C. burnetii</italic>. Our results showed that <italic>lyst</italic> transcription was up-regulated in the host cells after <italic>C. burnetii</italic> infection, but there is no significant change in <italic>lyst</italic> expression level after infection with the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) mutant strain, while CCVs expansion and significantly increasing load of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> appeared in the host cells with a silenced <italic>lyst</italic> gene, suggesting LYST inhibits the intracellular proliferation of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> by reducing CCVs size. Then, the size of CCVs and the load of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> in the HeLa cells pretreated with E-64d were significantly decreased. In addition, the level of iNOS was decreased significantly in LYST knockout THP-1 cells, which was conducive to the intracellular replication of <italic>C. burnetii</italic>. This data is consistent with the phenotype of L-NMMA-treated THP-1 cells infected with <italic>C. burnetii</italic>. Our results revealed that the upregulation of <italic>lyst</italic> transcription after infection is due to effector secretion of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> and LYST inhibit the intracellular replication of <italic>C. burnetii</italic> by reducing the size of CCVs and inducing <italic>nos2</italic> expression.</p>

## Genetic evidence on the causality between gut microbiota and various asthma phenotypes: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma is a multifarious disease that manifests in various phenotypes. Among the various factors that contribute to the development of asthma, the gut microbiota has recently emerged as a compelling area of investigation. This study aims to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota and distinct asthma phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 211 gut microbial taxa were used as study exposure. Five traits pertaining to various asthma phenotypes (asthma, allergic asthma, childhood asthma, suggestive for eosinophilic asthma and obesity-related asthma) were included as study outcome. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and sensitivity analysis for each bacterial taxa and asthma phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>We discovered a total of 58 associations that exhibited evidence of causality. Out of these, 4 associations remained significant even after applying multiple correction. An increased risk of asthma was causally associated with higher abundance of genus <italic>Holdemanella</italic> (OR = 1.11; CI: 1.05-1.17; p = 0.027), genus <italic>Oxalobacter</italic> (OR = 1.09; CI: 1.04-1.15; p = 0.025) and genus <italic>Butyricimonas</italic> (OR = 1.14; CI: 1.06-1.22; p = 0.027). Order <italic>NB1n</italic> was causally linked with an increased risk of obesity-related asthma (OR = 1.17; CI: 1.07-1.29; p = 0.015). There was limited overlap among the taxa that exhibited potential causal relationships with distinct asthma phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our research has provided genetic evidence that establishes multiple causal relationships between the gut microbiota and distinct asthma phenotypes, supporting the role of the gut microbiota in various asthma phenotypes. It is possible that different taxa play a role in the development of distinct asthma phenotypes. The causal relationships identified in this study require further investigation.</p></sec>

## Gut microbiome-based noninvasive diagnostic model to predict acute coronary syndromes

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Previous studies have shown that alterations in the gut microbiota are closely associated with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) development. However, the value of gut microbiota for early diagnosis of ACS remains understudied.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We recruited 66 volunteers, including 29 patients with a first diagnosis of ACS and 37 healthy volunteers during the same period, collected their fecal samples, and sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Functional prediction of the microbiota was performed using PICRUSt2. Subsequently, we constructed a nomogram and corresponding webpage based on microbial markers to assist in the diagnosis of ACS. The diagnostic performance and usefulness of the model were analyzed using boostrap internal validation, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to that of healthy controls, the diversity and composition of microbial community of patients with ACS was markedly abnormal. Potentially pathogenic genera such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> were significantly increased in the ACS group, whereas certain SCFA-producing genera such as <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Agathobacter</italic> were depleted. In addition, in the correlation analysis with clinical indicators, the microbiota was observed to be associated with the level of inflammation and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, a diagnostic model for ACS based on gut microbiota and clinical variables was developed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.963 (95% CI: 0.925–1) and an AUC value of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.549–0.641) for bootstrap internal validation. The calibration curves of the model show good consistency between the actual and predicted probabilities. The DCA showed that the model had a high net clinical benefit for clinical applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study is the first to characterize the composition and function of the gut microbiota in patients with ACS and healthy populations in Southwest China and demonstrates the potential effect of the microbiota as a non-invasive marker for the early diagnosis of ACS.</p></sec>

## A novel enemy of cancer: recent investigations into protozoan anti-tumor properties

date: 2024-01-11, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology

<p>Cancer remains a significant global health issue, despite advances in screening and treatment. While existing tumor treatment protocols such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have proven effective in enhancing the prognosis for some patients, these treatments do not benefit all patients. Consequently, certain types of cancer continue to exhibit a relatively low 5-year survival rate. Therefore, the pursuit of novel tumor intervention strategies may help improve the current effectiveness of tumor treatment. Over the past few decades, numerous species of protozoa and their components have exhibited anti-tumor potential via immune and non-immune mechanisms. This discovery introduces a new research direction for the development of new and effective cancer treatments. Through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and studies involving tumor-bearing mice, the anti-tumor ability of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, and other protozoa have unveiled diverse mechanisms by which protozoa combat cancer, demonstrating encouraging prospects for their application. In this review, we summarize the anti-tumor ability and anti-tumor mechanisms of various protozoa and explore the potential for their clinical development and application.</p>

## pg_dumpbinary v2.14 released

date: 2024-01-11, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Zurich, Switzerland - January 10th, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>pg_dumpbinary 2.14 was released today, it adds two new options and fixes some bugs reported by users since last release.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new option <code>--with-child</code>, when <code>-t</code> or <code>-T</code> options are used, to include or exclude child and partition tables. pg_dump will be used instead with options <code>--table-and-children</code> or <code>--exclude-table-and-children</code>. It requires PostgreSQL &gt;= 16.</li>
<li>Add <code>-V, --verbose</code> option that lists tables included in the dump.</li>
<li>Add <code>-A, --attach SNAPSHOT</code> to be able to attach pg_dumpbinary to an existing snapshot instead of creating a dedicated one.</li>
<li>Fix dump failure when sequences name have spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full list of changes and acknowledgments can be found <a href="https://github.com/lzlabs/pg_dumpbinary/releases/tag/v2.14">here</a></p>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first '\0', resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated dependencies to newer versions.</li>
<li>Enhanced the stability of the JSON line interaction protocol by utilizing the stdlib JSON encoder/decoder.</li>
<li>Modified the method for sending table metadata to custom transformers; now, it is sent via stdin in the first line in JSON format instead of providing it via command arguments.</li>
<li>Refactored template functions naming.</li>
<li>Rewritten NoiseDate transformer implementation for improved stability and predictability.</li>
<li>Changed the default value for the Dict transformer fail_not_matched parameter to true.</li>
<li>Rewritten Hash transformer, now providing a salt parameter and receiving a base64 encoded salt. If a salt is not provided, it generates one randomly.</li>
<li>Added validator for NoiseDate and RandomDate transformers for the truncate parameter, issuing a warning if the provided value is invalid.</li>
<li>Increased verbosity of parameter validation warnings, now properly forwarding warnings to stdout.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resolved pgx driver connection leakage issue.</li>
<li>Fixed deletion failure of dumps for S3 storage.</li>
<li>Corrected cobra autocompletion for the Greenmask utility.</li>
<li>Fixed NOT NULL constraint validation.</li>
<li>Addressed JSON API interaction issues that previously caused deadlocks and timeouts.</li>
<li>Fixed encode-decoding for binary parameters, ensuring accurate forwarding of values to custom transformers.</li>
<li>Fixed the RandomChoice transformer to correctly marshal and unmarshal values during validation.</li>
<li>Introduced the Nullable property for the SetNull transformer to enhance NOT NULL constraint validation.</li>
<li>Resolved text wrapping issues for the validate command.</li>
<li>Fixed build failures on Windows due to Linux platform dependencies.</li>
<li>Corrected stdout readline buffer reading during interaction with custom transformers.</li>
<li>Fixed integration tests.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ecosystem Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implemented CI/CD for the entire project.</li>
<li>Established a user-friendly playground in Docker-compose, including:</li>
<li>Deployed Minio storage container.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL container containing both the original database (Adventure Works) and the transformed (empty DB).</li>
<li>Greenmask container itself.</li>
<li>Refactored current readme files.</li>
</ul>
