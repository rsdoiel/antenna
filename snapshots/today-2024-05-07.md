<p>In recent years PC makers had two choices when it came to laptop memory. They could include SODIMM slots with support for user-replaceable DDR memory or LPDDR memory which typically uses less power and takes up less space, effectively trading repairability and upgradeability for longer battery life and/or more compact designs.

## What Happens in Texas When Summer Comes Early

date: 2024-05-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4ODEzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzY5MTQ0M30.g4JwjngfL2Tme9DmBmKx0iopEoA-iJqSHcG0x5eIULI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	It’s getting hot in Texas. Forecast highs for Tuesday are 89 degrees Fahrenheit in Houston, 92 in San Antonio, and 90 in Dallas. ERCOT, which operates the energy market that covers around 90% of the state, issued an “extreme hot weather event” warning and a “weather watch” due to “unseasonably high temperatures” — and “high levels of expected maintenance outages.”
</p><p>
	The whole country, but particularly Texas, is playing chicken with its existing fleet of natural gas-powered electricity infrastructure. While the weather-dependence of solar and wind are both obvious and well-known, gas, too, can be susceptible to nature’s fluctuations. High temperatures mean high demand, while very low temperatures can literally freeze whole gas production, distribution, and generation system, with <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-mega-freeze-of-2022-is-still-haunting-power-plants" target="_blank">catastrophic consequences</a>. </p><p>
	Natural gas powers around 60% of Texas’ electricity. While Tuesday’s is far from the hottest weather the state will face this year, it comes at what can be a fragile time for the grid. This is the end of the spring maintenance season, when power plant operators have a window to schedule outages necessary to perform maintenance after winter and ahead of summer, when electricity demand spikes again — what ERCOT calls the “<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2024/04/26/ERCOT_Trending_Topic_AAN.pdf" target="_blank"><u>shoulder seasons</u></a>.” </p><p>
	But weather increasingly does not conform to the plans of market regulators, with temperatures rising earlier in the year and falling later, impinging on that shoulder space. In April, ERCOT had to ask power plants to delay outages they had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ercot-asks-texas-power-generators-delay-outages-expected-heat-next-week-2024-04-12/" target="_blank"><u>already planned</u></a> due to high temperatures in <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2024/04/16/experts-warn-ercot-pause-in-maintenance-could-mean-more-breakdowns-during-summer" target="_blank"><u>parts of the state</u></a>.
</p><p>
	Shutting down a natural gas power plant can be fraught in Texas, where authorities are wary of destabilizing the grid. Other than 2021’s Winter Storm Uri, which caused days of blackouts and hundreds of deaths, one of the state’s worst-ever <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2006/04/27/10._rollblackouts_april_17_200.pdf" target="_blank"><u>blackouts happened in April 2006</u></a>, when high temperatures coincided with — you guessed it — planned outages for maintenance. Texas is not the only place that gets hot in the summer, of course, but its grid is both isolated from the rest of the country and is dealing with substantial growth in power demand, which means it’s more likely to bump up against its limits.<br/>
</p><p>
<span></span>“We’ve had a couple of pretty hot days and have more hot weather this week,” University of Texas professor Hugh Daigle told me. “What’s happening is that we’ve been operating close to the limit of available supply at peak demand.”
</p><p>
<span></span>While the grid in Texas has remained stable so far this spring — albeit with some <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_self"><u>wild price spikes</u></a> at times — delaying planned outages risks future <em>unplanned</em> power failures if operators fall behind on maintenance. Those failures are most likely to occur during the summer months, when high demand from air conditioning adds to stresses caused by the heat and ERCOT is less likely to allow the plants to come offline. In the best case scenario, a strained grid “only” results in electricity prices spiking. In the worst, it leads to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/12/texas-heat-deaths-2023-record-climate-change/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20don't%20wish%20this,tracking%20such%20deaths%20in%201989." target="_blank">blackouts and deaths</a> from extreme heat.</p><p>
	Along with three of his University of Texas colleagues, Joshua Rhodes, Aidan Pyrcz, and Michael Webber, Daigle recently published a paper showing that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S104061902300132X?dgcid=author" target="_blank">as Texas warms</a>, the times when it’s “safe” to have a large number of planned outages may shrink.<br/>
</p><p>
	Average temperatures in the state rose 0.8 degrees Celsius from 1895 to 2021, and are projected to go up another whole degree by 2036. While that may sound like a small change, this would increase the number of 100 degree Fahrenheit days — which often mean record-breaking electricity usage — by some 40%.
</p><p>
	While it may seem like a warming trend could have a symmetric and offsetting effect on the grid — hotter summer days that lead to record air conditioning demand but also warmer winter days that create less strain on electric heat — the researchers found that instead, the shoulder seasons were getting impinged on both sides. Compared to the 1950s, mild spring weather has been starting and ending earlier. At mid-century, spring started near the beginning of March; now it’s closer to the beginning of February. The start of fall, meanwhile, slid from the beginning of November later toward the middle of the month.
</p><p>
	If maintenance in the spring shoulder season can just occur just from March to May, “maintenance periods will no longer coincide with periods of low expected demand,” Daigle told me. And if it’s just in the fall season, which could shrink to October and November, “it may be unreasonable to expect power plants to be able to forgo spring maintenance.”
</p><p>
	“If you look at climate models and how average temperatures change,” Daigle said, “those two periods” — before the cold of winter and the heat of summer — “could merge into a single period in December and January.”
</p><p>
	Just one shoulder season introduces extreme risks, Daigle explained. “We still do get winter storms. It’s December and January and you have a lot of stuff down for planned maintenance, and something like Uri comes through — we’re up a creek.”</p>

## Russia bans US-funded rights group Freedom House

date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — Russia on Tuesday said it had declared U.S.-funded rights group Freedom House an "undesirable organization", effectively banning anyone from working for or having links with the group.


Authorities in Russia have declared dozens of media outlets, think tanks and non-profit organizations "undesirable" since 2015, a label rights groups say is designed to deter dissent.


In a statement, Russia's Prosecutor General said Freedom House had called for "comprehensive assistance to Ukraine to defeat Russia" and had "discredited" the Russian army.


"The organization provides information, financial, legal and other support to Russian opposition structures, pro-Western and LGBT activists, communities defending their interests, and persons convicted of terrorist crimes," it said.


Freedom House says it supports and provides funding to local democracy activists and civil liberty groups in more than 30 countries, receiving much of its financing from the U.S. State Department.


It is best known for its "Freedom in the World" index that measures each country's civil liberties and labels them "Free" or "Not Free". Russia is labelled "Not Free".


Since launching its offensive in Ukraine, Moscow has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that rights groups have likened to Soviet-era mass repression.


Among other organizations labelled as "undesirable" in Russia are the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, Transparency International and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

## Why do left and right have political meaning?

date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA

The divide between left and right is one of the most fundamental markers in politics. But have you ever stopped to think about why we use those directional terms to describe ideological camps? It may surprise you to learn that this terminology traces back to the seating arrangements of French revolutionaries over 200 years ago.

## Stack Overflow signs deal with OpenAI, bans users trying to alter answers

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

We&#8217;re all aware of Stack Overflow &#8211; it&#8217;s a place where programmers and regular users can ask technical questions, and get answers from anyone who thinks they know the answer. Stack Overflow has become so ubiquitous among programmers and developers, the concept of &#8220;I just copied the code off Stack Overflow&#8221; has become a consistent meme to indicate you don&#8217;t fully grasp how something works, but at least it works. If you&#8217;ve ever contributed answers to Stack Overflow, you might want to consider deleting them, altering them, or perhaps even go as far as request a GDPR removal if you&#8217;re in the European Union, because Stack Overflow has just announced a close partnership with &#8220;AI&#8221; company OpenAI (or, more accurately, &#8220;Open&#8221; &#8220;AI&#8221;). Stripped of marketing speak, the gist is exactly as you&#8217;d expect: OpenAI will absorb the questions and answers on Stack Overflow into its models, whether their respective authors like it or not. As much as you may want to try and delete your answers if you&#8217;re not interesting in having your work generate profit for OpenAI, deleting popular questions and answers is not possible on Stack Overflow. The other option is altering your answers to render them useless, but it seems Stack Overflow is not going to allow you to do this, either. Ben Humphreys tried to alter his highest-rated answers, and Stack Overflow just reverted them back, and proceeded to ban him from the platform. Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community. So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message. Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days. ↫ Ben Humphreys Now that they&#8217;ve made what is most likely an incredibly lucrative deal with OpenAI that&#8217;s going to net Stack Overflow&#8217;s owners boatloads of money, they obviously can&#8217;t let users delete or alter their answers to lower the monetary value of Stack Overflow&#8217;s content. Measures to prevent deletion or alteration are probably one of the clauses in the agreement between Stack Overflow and OpenAI. So there&#8217;s likely not much you can do to not have your answers sucked into OpenAI, but you should at least be aware it&#8217;s happening in case of future answers you might want to contribute.

## US repatriates 11 citizens from camp for relatives of Islamic State militants

date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA

BEIRUT — The United States has repatriated 11 of its citizens from sprawling camps in northeastern Syria that house tens of thousands of family members of suspected Islamic State militants, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday.


The repatriation was the largest Washington has carried out from the camps to date, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Five of the 11 citizens brought back were children, and one non-U.S. citizen child — the 9-year-old sibling of one of the other children — was also brought with them.


As part of the same operation, the U.S. facilitated the repatriation of 11 other camp residents, eight of them children, to Canada, the Netherlands and Finland, the statement said.


Although the pace of repatriations has picked up — neighboring Iraq recently returned hundreds of its citizens — many countries remain reluctant to bring back citizens from the al Hol and al Roj camps, which now hold about 30,000 people from more than 60 countries, most of them children.


The camps are run by local authorities affiliated with the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The SDF and its allies, including U.S.-led coalition forces, defeated the Islamic State group in Syria in 2019, ending its self-proclaimed Islamic "caliphate" that had ruled over a large swath of territory straddling Iraq and Syria.


Human rights groups have regularly reported on what they describe as inhumane living conditions and abuses in the camps and in detention centers where suspected Islamic State members are housed.


"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis" in the facilities "is for countries to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for wrongdoing," Blinken said in the statement.

## Running NetBSD on OmniOS using bhyve

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

I want to run GoToSocial on some *BSD system. Because I am who I am, I went for using NetBSD 10.0 . And because my hypervisor is running bhyve on OmniOS , you get the title of this blog post. Don’t get too anxious, it is quite straightforward. So let the journey begin. ↫ Joel Carnat Bhyve is a hypervisor originating from FreeBSD, while OmniOS is a distribution of illumos, a continuation of the last open source Solaris release from Oracle. GoToSocial, meanwhile, is an ActivityPub social network server, so it belongs in the same family as Mastodon, Glitch, Akkoma, and countless others. This guide makes this whole process look like a piece of cake, so if you&#8217;ve ever been interested in running your own ActivityPub server &#8211; read on. On a slightly related sidenote, there&#8217;s no OSNews AT instance, partly because I don&#8217;t want to deal with the moderation and costs, and partly because I&#8217;m incredibly happy being a member of Exquisite, a Glitch instance running on OpenBSD, managed by OpenBSD enthusiasts. Never say never, of course, but the odds of seeing an OSNews AT instance in the future are very slim.

## Will 2024 Be Hotter Than 2023?

But subsidies mask the true costs (environmental or otherwise) of these products. Cutting them could “lead to significant changes in consumption patterns and large emissions reductions.”

	Investment in overhauling agrifood will need to rise by $260 billion annually to halve emissions by 2030, the World Bank report said. But the cost benefits in terms of health, economic, and environmental outcomes are projected to surpass $4 trillion in 2030, which the report noted is a 16-to-1 return on investment costs.

	The flooding in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul state has prompted President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to call for a national plan to be put into place for preventing and dealing with climate disasters, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/MVFnnD-l6DjW4_sMTk6vW1QSW6y9Q695dPCz1N3Lg89s3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3p2W1sZy967k82W9W8vXNv-1xlgK5W61BMZc3wz1mQW1ZnQDL2t7pd8W2q50SF5dLjXZVcNYvt2qX27ZW2G5srr11_VbMW1V43QN9jk-GbMwZ2--h_HmBW1y8nq-21Ssy_W2lScsK3qdW_DW5kcZhp8G0g6yW7hf2JQ6R_W7XW2R871f7v1kSgW4GNX1w6PnK66W13ZQlf987qg7W47VL4M5Dwh37W5C90Bq8wX8g4W3-dlH05fnTtwW60H3SK1sx17tW5rtWHM7mRtGcW55nv3H7Z-130W89slJq13qTqnW4rKk8r3QQzQYW7Lld9v1GY5JLW5BLmhK5zfGyxVBCrgG2CzPnqW3l2wxB5l8yNQW2rMM3m5jp_qZW7QGDcc2TLQpwf8ptQ7l04" target="_blank">reported</a>. He instructed top environmental lieutenant Marina Silva to start putting together a strategy. “We have to stop just running after disaster,” Lula told the <em>Post</em>. “We have to start preparing for what can happen from disasters. … We and the world need to prepare every day with more plans and resources to deal with extreme climate occurrences.” At least 83 people are known to have died in the floods but the death toll is likely to climb. More than 20,000 people have lost their homes. Hospitals are without power. Inmates have been released from flooded prisons. Looting has begun. “This is war; that is the word,” said journalist Kelly Matos. “It’s hopelessness, civil unrest. … The tsunami is here.”

## May 6, 2024

date: 2024-05-07, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

In the New York Times today, Amy Qin and Patricia Mazzei reported on the new Florida law that prohibits many Chinese citizens from buying property in Florida, especially near important infrastructure like airports, refineries, and military installations. Qin and Mazzei note that more than three dozen states either have enacted or are crafting laws to restrict the purchase of land, businesses, or housing by Chinese nationals, even if they have legal residence in the United States. The justification for the laws is that Chinese investment in the U.S. is a national security risk, although Chinese nationals own less than 400,000 acres in the United States.

## Pro-Palestinian protesters break through barricades to retake MIT encampment

date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Pro-Palestinian protesters who had been blocked by police from accessing an encampment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Monday broke through fencing, linked arms and encircled tents that remained there, as Columbia University canceled its university-wide commencement ceremony following weeks of pro-Palestinian protests.


Sam Ihns, a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire, said the group has been at the encampment for the past two weeks and that they were calling for an end to the killing of thousands of people in Gaza.


"Specifically, our encampment is protesting MIT's direct research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense," he said.


Protesters also sat in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, blocking the street during rush hour in the Boston area.


The demonstrations at Columbia have roiled its campus and officials said Monday that while it won't hold it's main ceremony, students will be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based ceremonies this week and next.


The decision comes as universities around the country wrangle with how to handle commencements for students whose high school graduations were derailed by COVID-19 in 2020. Another campus shaken by protests, Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. Others, including the University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled off ceremonies with few disruptions.


Columbia's decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May 15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled a protest encampment last week. The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan said it made the decision after discussions with students.


"Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families," officials said.


Most of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 8 kilometers (5 miles) north at Columbia's sports complex, officials said.


Speakers at some of Columbia's still-scheduled graduation ceremonies include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames and Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health.


Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia's green or occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.


Similar encampments sprouted up elsewhere as universities struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.


The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.


Other universities have held graduation ceremonies with beefed-up security. The University of Michigan's ceremony was interrupted by chanting a few times Saturday. In Boston on Sunday, some students waved small Palestinian or Israeli flags at Northeastern University's commencement in Fenway Park.


Emory's ceremonies scheduled for May 13 will be held at the GasSouth Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of the university's Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves said in an open letter.


"Please know that this decision was not taken lightly," Fenves wrote. "It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department, security advisors and other agencies — each of which advised against holding commencement events on our campuses."


The 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated protests stemming from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.


Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.


Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, but Israel said the deal did not meet its "core demands" and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza town of Rafah.


"Cease-fires are temporary," said Selina Al-Shihabi, a Georgetown University sophomore who was taking part in a protest at George Washington. "There can be a cease-fire, but the U.S. government will continue to arm the Israeli military. We plan to be here until the university divests or until they drag us out of here."


At the University of California, San Diego, police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 64 people, including 40 students.


The University of California, Los Angeles, moved all classes online for the entire week due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling of an encampment last week. The university police force reported 44 arrests but there were no specific details, UCLA spokesperson Eddie North-Hager said in an email to The Associated Press.


Schools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threats of disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move to campus areas where demonstrations would be less intrusive.


The School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post Sunday that it offered protesters "amnesty from academic sanction and trespassing charges" if they moved.


"Many protesters left the premises of their own accord after being notified by the police that they were trespassing and subject to arrest," the school said. "Those that remained were arrested after multiple warnings to leave, including some of whom we recognized as SAIC students."


A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for any students who were arrested and suspended during recent protests. UNC Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the student activists.


Other universities took a different approach.


Harvard University's interim president, Alan Garber, warned students that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard could face "involuntary leave." That means they would not be allowed on campus, could lose their student housing and may not be able to take exams, Garber said.

## Met Gala in full bloom with Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Mindy Kaling among stars

date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA

New York — It's Met Gala time and the fashion parade of A-listers Monday included a swirl of flora and fauna looks on a green-tinged carpet surrounded by foliage. Jennifer Lopez went for silver leaves in a second-skin goddess gown and Zendaya was all vamp and fantasy.


Both are co-chairs of the annual fundraiser at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. And both received cheers from the crowd of fashion enthusiasts packed behind barriers outside.


Flowers were everywhere, in line with this year's theme: "The Garden of Time." Lopez (in Schiaparelli) was all va-va-voom in a near-naked gown that hugged like a second skin. She's got the Meta Gala down: It's her 14th.


This year's theme is inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same name.


Zendaya put on her fashion face in hues of blue and green, with a head piece to match and leaf accents.


It's been five years since Zendaya last attended the Met Gala. Her look, in peacock colors, was by Maison Margiela. Lopez went with Tiffany & Co. diamonds, including a stunning bird motif necklace with a diamond of over 20 carats at its center.


Mindy Kaling is sure to make the best-dressed lists in sand-colored swirls that towered over her head at the back. No worries about dinner. The back was removable. Her look was by Indian couturier Gaurav Gupta.


Fashion kings and queens ... and a good witch


Gigi Hadid brought the drama in a look by the drama king himself, Thom Browne. her white look was adorned with 2.8 million microbeads with yellow flowers and green thorns. She was high glam in a wavy bob and crimson lips.


If there's a queen of the Met Gala besides the evening's mastermind, Anna Wintour, it's Sarah Jessica Parker. The long-time attendee takes each year's theme seriously, researching every detail. This year she was in an Alice in Wonderland dress with a lavender overlay and a Philip Treacy topper on her head. The dress was by Richard Quinn. Her long hair tumbled behind her back in beachy waves, a look that built into a beauty trend of the evening.


Serena Williams took metallic gold to another level in a shining one-shoulder statement look. Ariana Grande was all Glinda the Good Witch, making the most of her pale-colored strapless look with 3D eyelashes at the side of each eye. She arrived with her "Wicked" co-star Cynthia Erivo, dressed in black with pink petals in a darker, edgy look.


Cardi B., who has THE most fun at the Met Gala, struck a pose or three in statement black with a huge tulle train. She paired the look with green jewels and a high black turban. She needed multiple helpers to move her dress up the stairs


Channeling Sleeping Beauty and the garden


Penelope Cruz, meanwhile, went goth in black by Chanel. It had a bustier top and a Sleeping Beauty-like off-shoulder silhouette. There was another Sleeping Beauty-ish guest: Kendall Jenner in a Givenchy look done by Alexander McQueen in 1999.


Kendall's sister, Kylie Jenner, was more Old Hollywood than storybook in a chic low-cut strapless look, a white bloom in her clicked-back updo and a train behind. Oddly, older sister Kim Kardashian tightly covered up her gorgeous silver corset look with a leaf motif by Maison Margiela with a lumpy gray sweater.


Dua Lipa was a whole different kind of princess. She went full rock 'n' roll in black by Marc Jacobs, who accompanied her.


The princess vibes were in apparent reference to the Met's spring exhibition that the gala kicks off. It's called "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion." While it doesn't actually have to do with Disney, or even princesses, some of the 400 guests went there.


Demi Moore stuck to the garden in a Harris Reed look with huge wings encircled by arrows and handpainted with pink and white blooms.


Diesel broke through on the gala red carpet on Dove Cameron. It was about as unlike Diesel as it gets, also going for the garden. The look had sleeves attached to her train.


Finding deeper meaning in the theme


Lily Gladstone went for black by Gabriela Hearst.


"We wanted me to feel draped in the power of my ancestors," she said. "For Kiowa and Blackfeet, our ancestors are the stars, that's where we come from. ... I feel like it's so long overdue that we have so much Indigenous representation and this sort of upper echelon world of high luxury fashion, because that is our aesthetic, you know, Natives have always loved luxury."


Floral looks and a special plus-1


Colman Domingo donned a white jacket with a cape and extra-wide trousers, holding a bouquet of white calla lilies, while Tyla chose a gown made to look like sand using actual sand on the fabric. She needed help with the hourglass she held as she made her way up the museum stairs. Domingo's designer was Willy Chavarria.


Sam Smith wore silver and gold metal roses tucked into the waist of a jacket, and Jack Harlow also channeled florals, but subtly with a silver and pearl floral boutonniere.


Wintour wore a black coat adorned with multicolored flowers. Her fellow co-chair Bad Bunny donned all black. A pregnant Lea Michele wore Rodarte, inspired by the brand's 2012 spring/summer collection.


"I'm honored to be here and bring my baby with me," Michele said. ""I don't think I was allowed a plus one, but I'm bringing" one, she said with a laugh. "I'm so grateful. I feel really beautiful, you know, in this pregnancy."


Looking to follow along? Here's a quick primer on what you need to know about the palooza of A-list celebrities from film, fashion, music, sports, politics and social media.


Among those who had way BIG fun with the nature and garden theme was Lana Del Rey. She walked up the museum steps as an actual tree, her face shrouded by fabric held up by her branches.


How to watch the Met Gala


That's tricky. Vogue has the exclusive livestream, which starts at 6 p.m. Eastern at Vogue.com. The feed will also be available on Vogue's digital platforms, including TikTok and YouTube.


Tons of other media will be on site, too. Catch the action on E!, also starting at 6 p.m., with livestreams on X, TikTok, Instagram and Peacock.


The Associated Press will be live outside the Mark Hotel, where many celebs get ready before heading to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for their walk up the grand staircase. That livestream will begin at 4:45 p.m. Eastern and will be available on YouTube and APNews.com.


Only the event's stacked red carpet is watchable — the gala's cocktail hour and dinner are notoriously private events.


What's the point of the Met Gala?


It's a party, for sure, with cocktails and dinner for about invited 400 guests, but it's also a huge fundraiser for the Met's Costume Institute, the only department at the museum required to pay for itself. Last year, the gala raised about $22 million. Wintour, a Met trustee for whom part of the institute has been renamed, organizes the whole shebang. No phones are allowed, adding to the allure.


It also promotes the museum's exhibit, which this year is called "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion." It includes 250 items from The Costume Institute's permanent collection, including some garments very rarely seen in public and so fragile they need to be under glass. Curators wanted to engage all the senses, including smell.


The exhibit opens to the public Friday and runs through Sept. 2.

## The VGA attribute controller is weird

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

The grabber in Windows 3.1 was improved to save and restore the index register as well, but it does not attempt to restore the flip-flop state, which is significant. The problem with the VGA emulation was that it erroneously applied the flip-flop state to reads from port 3C0h, and Windows 3.1 would save the wrong index register value… but only the second time through, because the flip-flop state was different at that point. That is to say, the Windows 3.1 standard mode grabber read from port 3C0h to query the attribute controller index register state, but the emulation returned the currently selected data register contents instead. And then, when restoring the attribute controller index register the next time around, the register would be restored to the wrong value which didn’t have bit 5 set, causing the screen to go blank. ↫ Michal Necasek It&#8217;s not every day that you learn how an aspect of the workings of VGA causes a blank screen under very specific circumstances when running Windows 3.1 in Standard mode under emulation, and that this specific aspect of the workings of VGA was implemented to maintain backwards compatibility with EGA. Absolutely bonkers.

## PowerPC 40x processor support to be dropped from the Linux kernel

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

In addition to Linux 6.10 expected to drop support for very old DEC Alpha processors (EV5 and earlier), it looks like the PowerPC 40x (early PowerPC 400 series) processor and platform support will be retired too. Back in 2020 was a proposal for dropping PowerPC 40x support from the Linux kernel given that the code was orphaned for a long time with no apparent users. The PowerPC 40x processors were found in thin clients, set-top boxes, and other devices during the 90&#8217;s. Finally now it looks like that the PowerPC 40x removal is set to happen. ↫ Michael Larabel Spring cleaning in the hardware support department. I wonder what has more users &#8211; Windows on ARM, or Linux on PowerPC 40x.

## First-generation Windows on ARM PCs will not be able to run Windows 11 24H2

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Windows 11 supports a variety of ARM processors from Qualcomm. According to the official documentation, you need a computer with the Snapdragon 850 processor inside or newer to run the current operating system officially. However, customers with PCs powered by the Snapdragon 835, the original Windows on ARM chip from 2016, can bypass hardware requirements and install Windows 11 at their own risk. Sadly, those days will be ending soon. Starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft&#8217;s operating system requires ARM v8.1 to run. An attempt to boot it from a device with an ARM v8.0-based processor results in system crashes. For reference, the Snapdragon 835 from 2016 is a chip with Kryo 280 cores, which are derivative of ARM&#8217;s Cortex-A73 cores. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I&#8217;m sure all three Windows on ARM users are devastated.

Here&#8217;s a question, O Internet: If I buy full-fat milk and dilute it 50/50 with water, do I effectively have semi-skimmed milk, or is there something more sophisticated about the skimming process? And if I then dilute it again, do I get skimmed milk&#8230; for one quarter of the price?

## Pulitzer Prizes in journalism awarded to The New York Times, The Washington Post, AP and others

date: 2024-05-06, from: VOA News USA

new york —  


The New York Times and The Washington Post were awarded three Pulitzer Prizes apiece on Monday for work in 2023 that dealt with everything from the war in Gaza to gun violence, and The Associated Press won in the feature photography category for coverage of global migration to the U.S.


Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and the aftermath produced work that resulted in two Pulitzers and a special citation. The Times won for text coverage that the Pulitzer board described as "wide-ranging and revelatory," while the Reuters news service won for its photography. The citation went to journalists and other writers covering the war in Gaza.


The prestigious public service award went to ProPublica for reporting that "pierced the thick wall of secrecy" around the U.S. Supreme Court to show how billionaires gave expensive gifts to justices and paid for luxury travel.Reporters Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg were honored for their work.


The Pulitzers honored the best in journalism from 2023 in 15 categories, as well as eight arts categories focused on books, music and theater. The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000.


The 15 photos in AP's winning entry were taken across Latin America and along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California in a year when immigration was one of the world's biggest stories. They were shot by AP staffers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelancers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia.


"These raw and emotional images came about through day-to-day coverage of a historic moment in multiple countries documenting migrants at every step of their treacherous journeys," said Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor.


The United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras.

 


 




The AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic.


In citing The Times for its work in Israel and Gaza, the Pulitzer board mentioned its coverage of the country's intelligence failures, along with the attack and Israel's military response.


The award comes even as The Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on the publication to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.


The Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia.


The Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its "sobering examination" of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos.


"We were eager to find a way to cover it differently and change the conversation about mass shootings," Peter Walstein, The Post's senior national enterprise editor, said in the newspaper.


The Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a "compelling and well-researched" series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell.


The New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City.


The staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won in the breaking news category for what the prize board called "nimble community-minded coverage" of flooding and mudslides. On its website Monday, Lookout Santa Cruz said that it made its coverage free at a time of crisis in the community, and also used text messages to reach people without power.


"In short, we did our jobs," the staff said in an unsigned article, "and we heard so many thanks for it. The Pulitzer is icing on that cake."


The Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an "eye-opening" series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses.


In local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, which showed how racism and the police contributed to the problem.


The Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies. The Pulitzer board's second special citation went to the late hip-hop critic Greg Tate.


The Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners.


For the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however.


The Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter.


The Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI.


The prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.

## American soldier arrested in Russia, accused of stealing, US officials say

date: 2024-05-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An American soldier has been arrested in Russia and accused of stealing, according to two U.S. officials.


U.S. officials said the soldier, Staff Sergeant Gordon Black, 34, was stationed in South Korea and was in the process of returning home to Fort Cavazos in Texas. Instead, officials said he traveled to Russia.


The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel details.

Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith confirmed that a soldier was detained on Thursday in Vladivostok, a major military and commercial Pacific port, on charges of criminal misconduct. She said Russia notified the U.S., and the Army told the soldier's family.


"The U.S. Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the soldier in Russia," Smith said.


It was unclear Monday if the soldier is considered absent without leave, or AWOL.


The arrest comes less than a year after American soldier Travis King sprinted into North Korea across the heavily fortified border between the Koreas. North Korea later announced that it would expel King, who was returned to the U.S. He was eventually charged with desertion.


Russia is known to be holding a number of Americans in its jails, including corporate security executive Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The U.S. government has designated both as wrongfully detained and has been trying to negotiate for their release.


Others detained include Travis Leake, a musician who had been living in Russia for years and was arrested last year on drug-related charges; Marc Fogel, a teacher in Moscow, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, also on drug charges; and dual nationals Alsu Kurmasheva and Ksenia Khavana.


The soldier's arrest in Russia was first reported by NBC News.

## Turns Out, NET Power Hasn’t Delivered Net Power

date: 2024-05-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4MDA3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDcyMjM1Nn0.NsJV4noyKBO2GZPBguCphDbfoJWYfsrXLpwCgr85Ipw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>NET Power’s power plants are an oil exec’s fantasy, an environmentalist’s nightmare, and an energy expert’s object of fascination. The company builds natural gas-burning power plants that, due to the inherent design of the system, don’t release carbon dioxide or other health-harming pollutants. If the tech can scale, it could be a key contender to complement solar and wind energy on the grid, with the ability to dispatch carbon-free power when it’s needed and run for as long as necessary, unconstrained by the weather.<br/></p><p>The company is especially well-positioned now that the Environmental Protection Agency has finalized emissions standards for new natural gas plants that require them to reduce their emissions by 90% by 2032 — part of what landed NET Power a spot on our list of 10 <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>make-or-break new energy projects</u></a> in the U.S. In checking in on how things were going at the company, however, we learned NET Power hadn’t made quite as much progress as we thought. </p><p>NET Power’s leadership has said its process is so efficient that when built at scale, it will produce cheaper power than a conventional natural gas plant. Today’s plants combust methane with air to heat up water and produce steam, which spins a turbine to generate electricity. NET Power’s system instead combusts methane with pure oxygen, producing extremely hot CO2 that can drive a specially designed turbine. By replacing air, which is about 78% nitrogen, with oxygen, the CO2 produced is very pure. The system recovers most of the gas and uses it to generate more electricity, but the small amount that is not recovered is easier (and cheaper) to capture and store than the mix of gases that comes out of a typical power plant. </p><p>The company, whose backers include Occidental Petroleum, Constellation Energy, and Baker Hughes, broke ground on a demonstration project in La Porte, Texas in 2016, and began testing the equipment in 2018. In November 2021, it made waves among clean energy wonks when it announced a major milestone: The plant had <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/co2-free-natural-gas-ccs-project-powers-grid-for-first-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>successfully “synchronized” with the Texas grid</u></a>, delivering enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes. </p><p>“This is a Wright-brothers-first-flight kind of breakthrough for energy,” NET Power’s then-CEO Ron DeGregorio said at the time. “Zero-emission, low-cost electricity delivered to the grid from natural gas-fueled technology.”</p><p>But the breakthrough wasn’t exactly <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/net-power-delivers-electricity-to-grid-in-major-technological-breakthrough-301425894.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what it seemed</u></a>. In reports filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission as recently as last month, under a section titled “Risk Factors,” the company noted that its La Porte demonstration plant has “not yet overcome all power loads to provide net positive power delivery to the commercial grid during its operation.”</p><p>In other words, despite having successfully delivered power to the Texas grid, NET Power’s plant did not — and still hasn’t — generated more power than it consumes. Here is the rest of the explanation from the filing:</p><blockquote>Our Demonstration Plant successfully generated electric power while synchronized to the grid, but it has not yet overcome all facility auxiliary power loads (pumps, compressors, etc.) to provide net positive power delivery to the commercial grid during its operation. If initial commercial power plants are unable to efficiently provide net power output to the commercial grid using the NET Power Cycle, this could harm our business, results of operation and reputation.</blockquote><p>The company told me this was all according to plan. “NET Power’s La Porte Demonstration Facility was designed and built for one goal — to prove the technical viability of the NET Power Cycle, which it did,” NET Power said in an emailed statement. “Given its small scale” — just 25 megawatts — “and the design considerations required for a flexible test facility, La Porte was not intended to provide net positive power to the grid.” It added that Project Permian, the company’s first utility-scale project, “is intended to generate and deliver net positive power,” and is expected to be operational in late 2027, or early 2028.</p><p>Though NET Power never said anything to the contrary, several energy experts I reached out to said this was news to them. “It’s sort of surprising that they didn’t report it before, because obviously that would have been known at the time,” Sara Hastings-Simon, a physicist who researches the energy transition at the University of Calgary. The excitement around NET Power is rooted in its potential to be cheaper than a typical carbon capture project, which adds a big cost to power generation. “The challenge is now, it’s really hard to know until it gets there whether there is truth to that statement or not,” said Hastings-Simon.</p><p>Chris Bataille, a research fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy who sees a lot of promise in the company’s technology, said he saw this as a red flag. “I don’t think it sinks it,” he told me. “I don’t think suddenly it has crashed and burned. But it does say that they’re less advanced.”</p><p>But Joshua Rhodes, an energy systems researcher at the University of Texas, was unfazed when I asked whether it mattered that the company still hadn’t passed this milestone after nearly three years. “I’m sure they would have liked to pass it by now and I don’t know if there are any factors that are hindering them,” he said in an email. “That said, it is a new technology that, if it can be shown to work, could be huge.”</p>

## The Make-or-Break Projects of the Energy Transition

date: 2024-05-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE2ODExNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Njk1MDg3Nn0.ePfYENNxm2pdn3H6fsWjMVTQG6p2rHMgIrGmq-wEA9w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The energy transition happens one project at a time. Cutting carbon emissions is not simply a matter of shutting down coal plants or switching to electric cars. It calls for a vast number of individual construction projects to coalesce into a whole new energy system, one that can generate, transmit, and distribute new forms of clean power. Even with the right architecture of regulations and subsidies in place, each project must still conquer a series of obstacles that can require years of planning, fundraising, and<strong> </strong>cajoling, followed by exhaustive review before they can begin building, let alone operating.<br/>
<br/>
	These 10 projects represent the <a href="#champlain">spectrum</a> of <a href="#mississippi">solutions</a> that could enable a transition to a carbon-free energy system. The list includes vastly scaled up versions of mature technologies like <a href="#empire">wind</a> and <a href="#easley">solar</a> power alongside the traditional energy <a href="#sunzia">infrastructure</a> necessary to move that power around<strong>. </strong>Many of the most experimental or first-of-a-kind projects on this list are competing to play the role of “clean firm” power on the grid of the future. Form’s <a href="#cambridge">batteries</a>, Fervo’s <a href="#cape">geothermal</a> plants, NET Power’s natural gas with <a href="#permian">carbon capture,</a> and TerraPower’s molten salt <a href="#natrium">nuclear reactor</a> could each — in theory — dispatch power when it’s needed and run for as long as necessary, unconstrained by the weather. Others, like Project Cypress, are geared at solving more distant problems, like cleaning up the <a href="#cypress">legacy carbon</a> in the atmosphere.
</p><p>
But they do not all have a clear path to success. Each one has already faced challenges, and many of them are likely to face a great number more. We call these the make-or-break energy projects because it's still unclear what the clean energy system of the future is going to look like, but the projects from this list are likely to play a big part in it — if, that is, they get there.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="easley"><br/>1.

<strong>Type of project:</strong> Solar farm<br/>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Intersect Power<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Desert Center, Riverside County, California.<br/>
<strong>Size:</strong> 400 megawatts of generation and 650 megawatts of storage<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> Possibly 2025<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>$990 million
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>Facing opposition from local retirees angered by the large number of projects popping up in the area, as well as from conservation-focused groups — such as Basin and Range Watch, which opposes many utility-scale energy projects in desert areas — Easley will be a test of whether California’s reforms to limit the timeframe of appeals to the state’s environmental reviews can actually work in getting a project approved and online faster.
</p><p>
	The early signs are promising. A nearby solar project by the same developer, Intersect Power, recently went into operation after getting approved by the Bureau of Land Management in January 2022. Easley could be operational “as early as late 2025,” according to a Plan of Development prepared for Intersect Power.
</p><p>
	Easley is also an example of what’s increasingly becoming standard in California, at both the residential and utility-scale level: pairing solar with storage. The California grid increasingly relies on batteries to keep the lights on as solar ramps up and down in the mornings and, especially, the evenings. The state has procured a massive amount of storage and has adjusted how utilities pay for rooftop solar in a way that encourages pairing battery systems with rooftop solar panels. This both stabilizes the grid and helps further decarbonize it, as batteries that are physically close to intermittent renewables are more likely to abate carbon emissions.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="cambridge"><br/>2.

<strong>Type:</strong> Energy storage<br/>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Form Energy and Great River Energy<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Cambridge, Minnesota<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>150 megawatt hours<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> End of 2025<br/>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Unknown; Goal of less than 1/10th cost of utility-scale lithium-ion batteries per megawatt hour
</p><p>
<span></span><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Form Energy first made waves in 2020 when it announced a contract with Great River Energy, a Minnesota electric utility, to build a battery that could store 100 hours’ worth of electricity, which was simply unheard of. Other energy storage companies were just trying to break the 4-hour limitation of lithium-ion, aiming for 8 hours or, at most, 12. Days-long energy storage would be a game changer for maintaining reliability during extreme weather events, storing renewable energy for stretches of cloudy days or windless nights or kicking in when demand peaks. At first, Form’s project was shrouded in mystery. How, exactly, would it do this? But a year later, the company revealed the secret chemistry behind its breakthrough: iron and oxygen. The batteries are filled with iron pellets that, when exposed to oxygen, rust, releasing electrons to the grid. They “charge” by running in reverse, using the electrical current from the grid to convert the rust back to iron.
</p><p>
	Since then, the hype has continued to build. Form has raised nearly $1 billion from venture capital and been awarded tens of millions more ingovernment grants. It has signed contracts with six utilities to deploy projects in California, New York, Virginia, Georgia, and Colorado, in addition to Minnesota. All this, despite not having completed a single project yet.
</p><p>
	The Great River Energy Project is set to be the first to come online. Originally, the company said it would be operating by the end of 2023; now it’s expected to start construction later this year and begin operating in early 2025, Vice President of Communications Sarah Bray told Heatmap. First, the company has to complete construction of its first factory in Weirton, West Virginia, where it will be producing all of the batteries. Bray said it expects to start high-volume production later this year.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="sunzia"><br/>3.

</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>This would be the biggest wind project in the country and a test case for a variety of energy policy objectives at both the state and federal level. For California, it would be a key step in decarbonizing its grid, as the state right now imports a large amount of its power, not all of which is carbon-free. For the federal government, it meets several goals — using public lands for carbon-free energy development, plus long-distance transmission to spur energy development across the country and link clean power resources in rural areas to major load centers.
</p><p>
	It would also mean an ambitious project could overcome long and concerted opposition. The project was first proposed in 2006, and its transmission line cleared environmental review back in 2015, but it has been mired in lawsuit after lawsuit. Most recently, a coalition of conservation groups and Indian tribes sued to halt construction on the power line portion of the project in Arizona’s San Pedro Valley, claiming that their cultural rights had not been adequately respected. In April, a judge allowed construction to continue, ruling that those claims were barred by the existing federal approvals, which had taken years to attain.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="empire"><br/>4.

<strong>Type: </strong>Offshore wind<br/>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Equinor<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>South of Long Island, New York<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>810 megawatts<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> 2026<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Not available, but an earlier estimate for developing two wind farms was $3 billion. Costs have since risen, but the second farm, Empire Wind 2, is no longer under contract.
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>The Northeast, and especially New York State, have aggressive aims for decarbonization, with a goal of 70% of the state’s electricity coming from renewables by 2030. The Biden administration also has a specific goal for 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and New York has a goal of 9 gigawatts by 2035. These types of high-capacity projects will be essential for the Northeast to decarbonize. The windy coast of the Atlantic Ocean is the most potent large-scale renewable resource in the region, and many of the region’s large load centers, such as New York City and Boston, are on the coast.
</p><p>
	Offshore wind, while expensive, can present less permitting hassle and local opposition than onshore wind or utility-scale solar. Empire Wind 1 (along with Sunrise Wind) matters tremendously for New York’s offshore wind program, which has been in development for years but has faced escalating costs and project cancellations. Only one offshore wind project is actually operational in the state, South Fork Wind, which was contracted outside the NYSERDA process and has around 130 megawatts of capacity. If Empire manages to get steel in the water and electrons flowing to the coast, it will be a sign that the Northeast’s — and thus the country’s — decarbonization goals are at least somewhat attainable.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="champlain"><br/>5.

<strong>Type:</strong> Transmission<br/>
<strong>Developers: </strong>Transmission Developers, which is owned by the Blackstone Group<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>339 miles / 1,250 megawatts<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> 2026<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>$6 billion
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>The Champlain Hudson Power Express, often referred to as CHPE (affectionately pronounced “chippy”) will deliver 1,250 megawatts of hydropower from Quebec into the New York City grid, which is currently about 90% powered by fossil fuels. It is “the most powerful project you’ll never see,” according to its developers, as it is the largest transmission line in the country to be installed entirely underground and underwater.
</p><p>
	The project is essential to New York’s goal to build a zero-emission electricity system by 2040. The line will supply an always-available source of clean power to supplement intermittent wind and solar generation and maintain a reliable grid. It has already overcome a number of barriers, including nearly a decade of environmental reviews, uncertainty over whether New York would buy its power, and opposition from conservation advocates concerned about the negative impacts of hydroelectric dams on the environment and on Native communities in Canada.
</p><p>
	When it begins operating, New Yorkers won’t just get cleaner power — they should also see air quality benefits almost immediately. The new line is expected to cut air pollution equivalent to that released by 15 of the city’s 16 fossil fuel-fired peaker plants.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="cape"><br/>6.

	Heatmap Illustration/Fervo
	</small>
</p><p>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Fervo<br/>
<strong>Type: </strong>Geothermal<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>Beaver County, Utah<br/>
<strong>Size:</strong> 400 megawatts<br/>
<strong>Operation date: </strong>2026, although the project isn’t expected to be finished until 2028<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Not disclosed, but Fervo raised $244 million and said that the cash “will support Fervo’s continued operations at Cape Station.”
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>This enhanced geothermal project is not the first one for Fervo. The company’s Nevada site, Project Red, began providing power for Google data centers in Nevada in November 2023. This planned site, however, will be far bigger: Fervo currently has authorization from the Bureau of Land Management for up to 29 exploratory wells, while the Project Red site had just two. Cape Station broke ground in September 2023, and in the first six months of drilling, Fervo said it reduced costs from drilling by 70% compared to its Project Red wells.
</p><p>
	As the grid decarbonizes and major power consumers like technology companies insist on having clean power for their operations, there will be massive and growing demand for so-called “clean firm” power, carbon-free power that is available all the time. Conventional wind and solar is intermittent, and existing battery technology only allows for limited output over time. Fervo’s “enhanced geothermal” technology uses techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry to be able to produce geothermal power essentially anywhere where there are hot enough rocks underneath the surface of the Earth, as opposed to conventional geothermal, which depends on locating hot enough fluid or stream.
</p><p>
	If Fervo can demonstrate that it can produce power at scale at costs comparable to existing conventional geothermal projects, it can expect a massive market for it and demand for more projects.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="natrium"><br/>7.

</p><p>
<strong>Type: </strong>Nuclear<br/>
<strong>Developer: </strong>TerraPower<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>Kemmerrer, Wyoming<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>345 megawatts<br/>
<strong>Operation date: </strong>Not available, but the company said in 2021 that it plans to be operational “in the next seven years.” Updated to the 2024 application, that would put it on track for a 2030 completion date.<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Not available, but TerraPower has raised around $1 billion and the federal government has pledged around $2 billion to support the project, which TerraPower has said it will “match … dollar for dollar.”
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>TerraPower is just one of many companies flogging designs for advanced nuclear reactors, which are smaller and promise to be cheaper to build than America’s existing light-water nuclear reactor fleet. The construction permit application the company submitted in March was a first for a commercial advanced reactor. TerraPower matters as much for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it does for anyone else, as it’s a test of whether the NRC can meet Congress and the White House’s preference for a more accelerated approval process for advanced nuclear power.
</p><p>
	TerraPower’s design, if successful, would be a landmark for the American nuclear industry. The reactor design calls for cooling with liquid sodium instead of the standard water-cooling of American nuclear plants. This technique promises eventual lower construction costs because it requires less pressure than water (meaning less need for expensive safety systems) and can also store heat, turning the reactor into both a generator and an energy storage system.
</p><p>
	While there are a number of existing advanced nuclear designs, several of which involve liquid sodium, Natrium could potentially play well with a renewable-heavy grid by providing steady, unchanging output like a current nuclear reactor as well as discharging stored energy in response to renewables falling off the grid.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="mississippi"><br/>8.

</p><p>
<strong>Type: </strong>Hydrogen<br/>
<strong>Developer:</strong><strong> </strong>Hy Stor<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>Project components located throughout Mississippi, with some in Eastern Louisiana<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>Goal of 340,000 metric tons per year (phase one)<br/>
<strong>Operation date: </strong>2027<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Initially reported as <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/company-announces-first-of-a-kind-3b-renewable-hydrogen-project/" target="_blank"><u>$3 billion</u></a>; recently reported as <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2024/04/24/green-hydrogen-company-looks-to-make-mississippi-a-leader-of-new-renewable-venture/#:~:text=Luce%20said%20that%20the%20first,customers%20to%20finance%20the%20operation." target="_blank"><u>more than $10 billion</u></a>. (In response to an inquiry from Heatmap, the company replied that it “will be in the multiple billions of dollars.”
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>Truly carbon-free hydrogen could unlock big emissions reductions across the economy, from fertilizer production, to steelmaking, to marine shipping. But few companies are going to the lengths that Hy Stor is gto ensure its product is really clean. The company is building the first off-grid hydrogen production facility powered entirely by wind and solar. That means Hy Stor will have no problem claiming the new hydrogen production tax credit, which requires companies to match their operations with clean energy sources by the hour — a provision that’s been contested by large portions of the hydrogen industry.
</p><p>
	For a company that has never built anything before, the scale of Hy Stor’s Mississippi project is ambitious. The company has acquired about 70,000 acres across Mississippi and Louisiana, along with 10 underground salt domes — mounds of salt buried beneath the Earth’s surface that can be dissolved to form cavernous, skyscraper-sized storage facilities for hydrogen. Those salt domes are the key to Hy Stor’s approach, and what enables the company to rely on intermittent renewables. By storing vast amounts of hydrogen, the company will be able to deliver a steady supply to customers and will also have a backup source of energy for its own operations when wind and solar are less available.
</p><p>
	Chief Commercial Officer Claire Behar told Heatmap the company has obtained many of the necessary permits, including for its salt caverns and the plant’s water use. It plans to begin construction at the beginning of 2025, and to have the first phase of the project “in service at scale” by 2027. Hy Stor recently announced <a href="https://nelhydrogen.com/press-release/nel-asa-hy-stor-energy-places-gigawatt-capacity-reservation-for-mississippi-clean-hydrogen-hub/" target="_blank"><u>a deal to purchase its electrolyzers</u></a>, devices that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, from a Norwegian company called Nel Hydrogen.

	</small>
</p><p>
<strong>Type:</strong> Carbon removal<br/>
<strong>Developers: </strong>Climeworks, Heirloom, and Battelle<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana<br/>
<strong>Size:</strong> Goal of capturing 1 million metric tons per year<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> About 2030<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Total project cost unknown; eligible for up to $600 million from the Department of Energy for its Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs Program.
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>Project Cypress might be the most ambitious project to remove carbon from the atmosphere under development in the world. It is a collaboration by two leading direct air capture companies, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, which were among the first to demonstrate their ability to capture carbon directly from the air and store it at commercial scale. Now, the two will be attempting to scale up exponentially, from capturing a few thousands tons per year to a combined million.
</p><p>
	Last August, the Department of Energy selected Project Cypress to be one of four direct air capture hubs it will support with $3.5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In March, the project was awarded its <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>first infusion of $50 million</u></a>, but the developers will have to do extensive community engagement to continue receiving funding. Battelle, the project developer, told Heatmap the project has also received an additional $31 million in private investment.
</p><p>
	Between financing, permitting challenges, renewable energy sourcing, and community opposition, the project is sure to face a bumpy road ahead. The project and its developers have no ties to the oil and gas industry, but that hasn’t done much to win over the support of environmental justice advocates, who see the project as a dangerous distraction from cutting emissions and pollution in Louisiana. But if Project Cypress is successful, it will show the world what direct air capture looks like at climate-relevant scales.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="permian"><br/>10.

	Heatmap Illustration/NET Power
	</small>
</p><p>
<strong>Type: </strong>Carbon capture<br/>
<strong>Developer: </strong>NET Power<br/>
<strong>Location: </strong>Ector County, Texas<br/>
<strong>Size: </strong>300 megawatts<br/>
<strong>Operation date:</strong> Late 2027 or early 2028<br/>
<strong>Cost: </strong>About<strong> </strong>$1 billion
</p><p>
<strong>Why it matters: </strong>Oil and gas CEOs love to say that the problem is not fossil fuels, the problem is emissions. NET Power’s technology — a natural gas power plant with zero emissions, carbon or otherwise — could prove to be the ultimate vindication of that statement. In short, NET Power’s system recycles most of the CO2 it produces and uses it to generate more energy. It also utilizes pure oxygen, unlike typical natural gas plants that take in regular air, which is mostly nitrogen. This means that any remaining CO2 not recycled in the plant is relatively pure and easy to capture.
</p><p>
	NET Power opened a 50 megawatt demonstration plant in La Porte, Texas, in 2018, and is developing a 300 megawatt commercial plant in Ector County, Texas, in partnership with Occidental Petroleum, Baker Hughes, and Constellation Energy. On a recent earnings call, CEO Danny Rice said the project was “expected to have a lower levelized cost per kilowatt hour than new nuclear, new geothermal, and new hydro.”
</p><p>
	The company generated a lot of excitement among energy experts in the fall of 2021 when it announced that its La Porte project had successfully delivered power to the Texas grid. It also raised a lot of money when it went public last summer. But things have been somewhat rocky since. During a December earnings call, NET Power’s president told investors that its first commercial plant would be <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/worlds-first-nearly-zero-emission-gas-plant-delayed-until-2027/" target="_blank"><u>delayed by at least a year</u></a> due to supply chain challenges. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company also applied for funding from the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations last year, but was not selected. It has not yet found any third parties to license its technology or offtakers to buy energy from the Ector County plant, and noted in its recent filings that while the La Porte pilot project delivered electricity to the grid, it did not, in fact, deliver “net” power — meaning that it used more power than it generated.
</p><p>
	A spokesperson for the company told Heatmap the La Porte facility was solely intended to “prove the technical viability of the NET Power Cycle” and not intended to produce net power. So everything’s now riding on Project Permian.

## Snikket: this week’s sponsor

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption, group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available. Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week&#8217;s sponsorship to Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!

## With PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except Data General)

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I&#8217;ve ever found, and I&#8217;m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the world. Here&#8217;s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the operating system&#8217;s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with it? Well, what do you think we&#8217;re gonna do with it? We&#8217;re going to program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course, since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we&#8217;ll talk more about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture, and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it&#8217;s not surprising there weren&#8217;t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The device that&#8217;s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the market for a few months, so it&#8217;s definitely a rarity.

## Palm OS gets a TOTP application

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Still rocking your Palm OS device, but mutter under your breath every time you need to log into a website or service with two-factor authentication? Sick of carrying around an Android or iOS device just so you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫ Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is wild, and I absolutely love it. I might if set it up on one of my dozens of Palm OS devices and just put it next to my keyboard for easy access. There&#8217;s no cooler way to handle 2FA than this.

## Columbia University cancels main commencement after protests that roiled campus for weeks

date: 2024-05-06, from: VOA News USA

New York — Columbia University is canceling its large university-wide commencement ceremony amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests but will hold smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next, the university announced Monday.


"Based on feedback from our students, we have decided to focus attention on our Class Days and school-level graduation ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, and to forego the university-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15," Columbia officials said in a statement.


The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.


The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue.

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping visits Europe for the first time in five years, and trade tensions look likely to be high on the agenda. Has Sweden become a paradise for the superrich? It&#8217;s had a reputation for championing social equality, but there&#8217;s been a rapid boom in the number of Swedish multimillionaires and billionaires in recent years. The actor Will Ferrell is the latest Hollywood megastar to invest in English soccer club Leeds United — following in the footsteps of Russell Crowe.</p>

For the study, scientists from Stanford University, Harvard University, and the Central California Asthma Collaborative measured NO2 levels in more than 100 homes and created an air quality index that pulled in other data sets including cooking habits, ventilation, and home size. Their results show that NO2 pollution spreads throughout the home, and people living in spaces that are less than 800 square feet in size have four times more long-term NO2 exposure than people in homes that are larger than 3,000 square feet. Indigenous, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Black households have the highest exposure to NO2.</p><h3>4.
