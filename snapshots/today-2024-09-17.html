owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over ‘foreign
interference’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — Meta said it’s banning Russia state media organization from
its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive
tactics to amplify Moscow’s propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke
from the Kremlin on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late
Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an
escalation of its efforts to counter Russia’s covert influence
operations. </p>
<p>“After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement
against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other
related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign
interference activity,” Meta said in a prepared statement. </p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that “such
selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,” and that
“Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.” </p>
<p>“We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of
course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with
Meta,” Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call. </p>
<p>RT was formerly known as Russia Today. Rossiya Segodnya is the parent
company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like
Sputnik. </p>
<p>“It’s cute how there’s a competition in the West — who can try to
spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,” RT said
in a release. </p>
<p>Rossiya Segodnya did not respond to a request for comment from The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>Meta’s actions comes days after the United States announced new
sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of
Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic
adversaries. </p>
<p>U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand
with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for
sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in
Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites
but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa,
South America and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run
websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of
dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to
publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin
messages. </p>
<p>Moscow has rejected the allegations. </p>
<p>Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow’s online reach. Since
2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years
later, it blocked state media from running ads and putting their content
lower in people’s feeds, and the company, along with other other social
media sites like YouTube and TikTok, blocked RT’s channels for European
users. Also in 2022 Meta also took down a sprawling Russia-based
disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the
invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p>Meta and Facebook “already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now
they’re censoring information flow to the rest of the world,” RT said in
its statement. </p>
<p>Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in
March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking
Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk’s X,
formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with
Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent
media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are
now only accessible through virtual private networks.</p>

<h2 id="sean-diddy-combs-charged-with-racketeering-sex-trafficking">Sean
‘Diddy’ Combs charged with racketeering, sex trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been hit with three
federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and
transportation to engage in prostitution, according to an indictment
unsealed on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Combs, 54, was arrested in Manhattan by federal agents on Monday
night, following a year in which his career was derailed by several
lawsuits accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. </p>
<p>Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lawyer, said he was disappointed with the
decision to pursue an “unjust prosecution” of the rapper and
producer. </p>
<p>“Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving
family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years
building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the
Black community,” Agnifilo said on Monday night. “He is an imperfect
person, but he is not a criminal.” </p>
<p>Agnifilo added that Combs voluntarily relocated to New York in
anticipation of the charges. </p>
<p>Combs, who has also been known as P. Diddy and Puff Daddy, was a
major figure in hip-hop in the 1990s and 2000s. He founded the label Bad
Boy records, and is credited with helping turn rappers and R&amp;B
singers such as Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, Notorious B.I.G. and Usher
into stars. </p>
<p>His reputation came under fire last November when former girlfriend
Casandra Ventura, an R&amp;B singer known as Cassie, accused him in a
lawsuit of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during their
decade-long relationship. She agreed to an undisclosed settlement one
day after suing, even as Combs denied her allegations. </p>
<p>His legal pressures mounted, and he has faced several civil lawsuits
by women and men who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct.
His lawyers have been fighting those cases in court. Federal agents
raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami Beach, Florida six months
ago. </p>
<p>Singer Dawn Richard, formerly of Danity Kane, last week accused Combs
in a lawsuit of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, gender
discrimination and fraud. </p>
<p>A Michigan judge this month ordered Combs to pay $100 million to
Derrick Lee Smith, who said Combs drugged and sexually assaulted him at
a party almost 30 years ago, after Combs failed to show up to defend
himself in court. A lawyer for Combs said he would seek to dismiss that
judgment. </p>
<p>Combs has also rejected claims in a February sex trafficking lawsuit
by Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, who Combs employed as a producer on his 2023
release “The Love Album: Off the Grid.” </p>
<p>The indictment is not Combs’ first brush with the law. He was
acquitted in March 2001 of bribery and weapons charges in a criminal
trial stemming from a nightclub shooting that left three people
wounded.</p>

id="analysts-say-vietnam-officials-us-trip-could-set-path-to-c-130-deal">Analysts
say Vietnam official’s US trip could set path to C-130 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Analysts say this week’s visit to
Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances
in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese
nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in
Vietnam.</p>
<p>A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set
the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes
from the United States this year.</p>
<p>Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on
Monday. [September 9] Both leaders “reaffirmed the importance of the
U.S.-Vietnam partnership,” the Defense Department said in a statement,
and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’
ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in
Hanoi’s diplomatic hierarchy.</p>
<p>The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to
address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced
that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to
complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the
total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary
storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam
War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those
nearby.</p>
<p>Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and
Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told
VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing
war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains
of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy
Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide
“opportunity for them to have high level support.”</p>
<p>Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington
and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts
also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly.</p>
<p>“The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral
defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on
humanitarian missions,” Abuza said during the August 29 call.</p>
<p>“We’ve just continued to build on that,” he added.</p>
<p>Cargo planes</p>
<p>Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing
Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed
sources.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld
because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130
deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang’s visit. The analyst
said the deal was held back by the “massive [U.S.] bureaucracy” and
because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be
“too inflammatory for the Chinese.”</p>
<p>Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore, noted Vietnam’s delicate diplomatic balancing act,
illustrated by Giang’s travel itinerary before the Washington trip.</p>
<p>“Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in
balance,” he wrote in an email on August 30. “As such, Vietnamese
Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.”</p>
<p>Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a
threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam.</p>
<p>“C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and
supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets
are non-strategic and won’t shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,”
he wrote.</p>
<p>Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of
New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a “symbolic
move.”</p>
<p>“Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense
cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a
higher, more meaningful level,” he told VOA on August 30. “The C-130
would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still
mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal
would not rankle China too much.</p>
<p>“It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,” he said of a potential
C-130 purchase. “Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United
States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam
would just buy non-lethal weapons.”</p>
<p>Rising nationalism</p>
<p>Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington
relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western
sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong
said.</p>
<p>Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the
United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a “color revolution,”
similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of
Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a
graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution.</p>
<p>The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright
issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam’s
conservative and liberal factions.</p>
<p>“It’s a presentation of a continuous struggle between different
factions, one conservative and one liberal,” Phuong said.</p>
<p>Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten
control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in
1975.</p>
<p>“Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,” he said.
“The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of
sensitivities.”</p>
<p>Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar
around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam
flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese
high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police
after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would
“probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.”</p>
<p>“There’s extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,” Phuong said.
“It’s against Western values.”</p>

The number of jobs in the U.S. solar industry last year grew to 279,447,
up 6% from 2022, according to a
<a href="https://irecusa.org/census-solar-job-trends/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8y4oVUnJHGc756BUahnx-2ulysoVpLclWgRZFx7qrQmRQJYthVaLpxuaXryGBLE-n1oAJz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
report</a> from the nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
Utility-scale solar added 1,888 jobs in 2023, a 6.8% increase and a nice
rebound from 2022, when the utility-scale solar market recorded a loss
in jobs. The report warns that we might not see the same kind of growth
for solar jobs in 2024, though. Residential installations have dropped,
and large utility-scale projects are struggling with grid connection.
The report’s authors also note that as the industry grows, it faces a
shortage of skilled workers.

Most employers reported that hiring qualified solar workers was
difficult, especially in installation and project development. “It’s
difficult because our projects are built in very rural areas where there
just aren’t a lot of people,” one interviewee who works at a
utility-scale solar firm said. “We strive to hire as many local people
as possible because we want local communities to feel the economic
impact or benefit from our projects. So in some communities where we go,
it is difficult to find local people that are skilled and can perform
the work.”

<h2 id="china-says-it-tailed-us-aircraft-over-taiwan-strait">China says
it tailed US aircraft over Taiwan Strait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — The Chinese military tailed a U.S. aircraft that flew
through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, Beijing’s
army said, vowing to “resolutely defend national sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“On September 17, a U.S. P-8A anti-submarine patrol aircraft flew
through the Taiwan Strait,” Li Xi, a senior captain and spokesperson for
the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army,
PLA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PLA theater command “organized fighter jets to tail and stand
guard against the US aircraft’s flight, dealing with it in accordance
with the law,” Li said.</p>
<p>“Theater troops are on constant high alert to resolutely defend
national sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability.”</p>
<p>Beijing views self-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province and claims
jurisdiction over the body of water that separates the island from the
Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet said in a statement that a “P-8A
Poseidon transited the Taiwan Strait in international airspace on
Sept. 17 (local time).”</p>
<p>The statement did not mention the aircraft being tailed by the
Chinese military.</p>
<p>“By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with
international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and
freedoms of all nations,” it said.</p>
<p>“The aircraft’s transit of the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United
States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement “a US P-8A aircraft
passed through Taiwan Strait from south to north this morning.”  </p>
<p>“The military has monitored the situation and no anomaly was detected
in our surroundings,” it said.</p>
<p>China also accused Germany of heightening security risks in the
Taiwan Strait on Saturday after two of its military vessels sailed
through the waterway.</p>
<p>Taipei thanked Washington on Tuesday for approving $228 million worth
of “return, repair, and reshipment of spare parts” for its aircraft and
related equipment, the 16th such sale of arms to the island under U.S.
President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a separate statement the deal was
expected to take effect in a month and “will help maintain the combat
readiness and safety of various types of aircraft equipment of our air
force”.</p>

id="judge-rejects-former-trump-aides-bid-to-move-arizona-case-to-federal-court">Judge
rejects former Trump aide’s bid to move Arizona case to federal
court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief
of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona’s
fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has
failed in trying to get his charges out of state court.</p>
<p>In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows
missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal
court, didn’t offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that
the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of
staff to the president.</p>
<p>Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities
allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in
Trump’s favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the
Georgia case last year. It’s unknown whether Meadows will appeal the
decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of
Meadows’ attorneys.</p>
<p>While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while
chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names
of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to
keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has
pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia.</p>
<p>In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.</p>
<p>The decision sends Meadows’ case back down to Maricopa County
Superior Court.</p>
<p>In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be
moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a
federal official working as Trump’s chief of staff and that he has
immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says
federal law trumps state law.</p>
<p>Arizona prosecutors said Meadows’ electioneering efforts weren’t part
of his official duties at the White House.</p>
<p>Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his
request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an
appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review
the ruling.</p>
<p>The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff
member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election.
Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state
officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy.</p>
<p>Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona
case.</p>
<p>Meadows’ attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done
in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of
allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in
front of Trump — or “seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy
and status of various legal efforts by the president’s campaign.”</p>
<p>In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona’s fake
electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a
document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and
five lawyers connected to the former president.</p>
<p>In August, Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely
with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation
agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges.
Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be
convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge and was sentenced to probation.</p>
<p>The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery,
fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona.</p>
<p>Trump wasn’t charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as
an unindicted coconspirator.</p>
<p>The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona’s Republican electors
met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were
“duly elected and qualified” electors and claimed Trump had carried the
state.</p>
<p>A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media
by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent
to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also
filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.</p>

id="next-generation-of-buffetts-is-poised-to-become-one-of-the-biggest-forces-in-philanthropy">Next
generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in
philanthropy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — The next generation of Buffetts — Howard, Susie and
Peter — is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in
philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman
and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes
away.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t always going to be that way.</p>
<p>Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now
valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his
three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates
Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago.</p>
<p>The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the
money away, Warren Buffett said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual
donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which
will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a
new charitable trust in November.</p>
<p>Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he’s learned what his father
told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: “It’s not so easy
to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be
intelligent about it.”</p>
<p>The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever
and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: “It’s pretty amazing
that he’s giving us this opportunity.”</p>
<p>Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with
significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 — a remarkable
$43 billion to date.</p>
<p>“Wealthy people don’t tend to give their money to other people to
give away,” said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on
Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California.
But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their
fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their
ingenuity, he said.</p>
<p>Ferris thinks the story of Buffett’s changing philanthropic
intentions is a positive one. “It shows how a donor is making choices
and is adapting to circumstances,” he said.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett’s
decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in
a statement that “Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous,” and
that he has “played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the
foundation’s work to create a world where every person can live a
healthy, productive life.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual
donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three
children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight
into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts.</p>
<p>The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett’s
first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports
organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to
contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its
board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member.</p>
<p>Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter
of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to
organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts’
hometown.</p>
<p>Peter Buffett’s NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of
organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against
gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to
reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American
communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a
focus on agriculture and food access.</p>
<p>The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation
and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800
million — more than most countries — to humanitarian initiatives in
Ukraine during the country’s war with Russia. These include supporting
food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of
a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain.</p>
<p>In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to
speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn’t predict
exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father’s fortune.
However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make
the biggest difference as their father recommended.</p>
<p>“I can tell you, we’ll sit down in a room when the time comes, and
we’ll get it figured out pretty quickly,” he said, acknowledging that
the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a
challenge.</p>
<p>The siblings’ different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are
assets, he said.</p>
<p>“What this is going to do is we’re going to bring all of our
collective experience together,” he said.</p>
<p>But don’t expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which
the siblings have largely avoid even as they’ve given away more than $15
billion of their father’s money since 2006.</p>
<p>Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations,
said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business,
with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring
institutions in their foundations.</p>
<p>“It is a big deal,” she said, of the amount of money that the
Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will
likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums
to spend it down.</p>
<p>The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects
one of Warren Buffett’s longstanding conditions for receiving charitable
funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family’s
foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a
year.</p>
<p>The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny
staffs — much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire
Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its
headquarters in Omaha.</p>
<p>Howard Buffett said his foundation employs just 22 staff members. It
granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He
acknowledged that his “lean” staff puts some limits on their capacity,
but said the way they’ve scaled their work is through creating strong
and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement
their ideas.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Gates Foundation has one of the largest endowments
at $75.2 billion, funded by donations from Bill Gates and Warren
Buffett. It employs more than 2,000 people, many of them technical
experts all over the world, and is known for making highly directed
grants with rigorous reporting requirements. The foundation has said it
will wind down its operations within 25 years after its founders’
deaths.</p>
<p>Howard Buffett said he likes a challenge and thinks that in general,
wealthy people should give their money away within their lifetimes,
rather than holding it in perpetual foundations.</p>
<p>“Somebody is going to spend that money. Somebody is going to give
that money away,” he said. “So, I would rather do that with my brother
and sister and do it together, as a partnership, than see it done any
other way.”</p>

id="us-will-continue-to-push-for-release-of-detainees-in-china-state-department-says">US
will ‘continue to push’ for release of detainees in China, State
Department says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — On Monday, after the U.S. State Department announced the
release of David Lin, an American pastor, from nearly two decades of
imprisonment in China, officials said more work remains to secure the
freedom of other Americans held in China. </p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that
the U.S. government had been working to secure Lin’s release for some
time. </p>
<p>“When it comes to David Lin, we are glad to see he is released. We
welcome it. We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,”
Miller said during a regular press briefing.</p>
<p>Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 after entering China. He was later
convicted of contract fraud and given a life sentence in 2009. After
Chinese courts reduced his sentence, he was set to be released from
Beijing in 2029.</p>
<p>Bob Fu, a pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a nonprofit dedicated to
religious freedom in China, called the original charges against Lin a
“scam” and said they were facilitated by the Chinese government as a
gambit to unjustly take hostages.</p>
<p>The imprisonment and now release of Lin, Fu told VOA, is especially
significant as China is increasingly cracking down on religious
practices within the country, with human rights violations in Xinjiang
and Tibet and growing governmental restrictions on Christian
traditions. </p>
<p>Despite this, Fu said that the success of Lin’s release could be
attributed to two factors: the souring of the global public opinion on
China and the hard work of U.S. officials.</p>
<p>“This shows that if our top political leaders really take this
seriously and persistently, it will bear fruits for our citizens’
freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>According to the Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to freeing
detainees through dialogue with China, over 200 American nationals in
China under coercive measures, including wrongful detentions and exit
bans.</p>
<p>The State Department has listed two other detained individuals as
priority cases: Businessman Kai Li, accused of espionage in 2016, and
Mark Swidan, convicted of drug trafficking in 2019.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,” Miller said.
“It’s something that we have been working on for some time.”</p>
<p>Miller declined to say if Lin’s release had been the result of a
swap, according to a report by Reuters.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked if
Beijing had received anything from the U.S. in return for Lin’s release,
according to Reuters. The embassy also told Reuters that Chinese
authorities handle criminal suspects in accordance with the law and
“treat them equally regardless of their nationality.”</p>
<p>Later this week, a U.S. congressional hearing is set to be held on
Americans who have been arbitrarily imprisoned in China.</p>

id="boeing-says-its-weighing-temporary-layoffs-to-save-cash-during-machinists-strike">Boeing
says it’s weighing temporary layoffs to save cash during machinists
strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>seattle — Boeing plans to freeze hiring and reduce travel and is
considering temporary layoffs to save cash during a factory worker
strike that began last week, the company told employees Monday. </p>
<p>The company said the moves, which include reduced spending on
suppliers, were necessary because “our business is in a difficult
period.” </p>
<p>Chief financial officer Brian West detailed 10 immediate cutbacks in
a memo to employees. They include a freeze on hiring across all levels,
a pause in pay increases for managers and executives who get promoted,
and a cancellation of all travel that isn’t critical. </p>
<p>“We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs
for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,” West
said. </p>
<p>Boeing’s business is in a difficult spot, he said, adding: “This
strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.” </p>
<p>About 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers began a strike early Friday. The
walkout came after workers rejected an offer of a 25% increase in pay
over four years. The union originally sought a pay hike of at least
40%. </p>
<p>Representatives of the company and the union are scheduled to meet
Tuesday with federal mediators. The union has started to survey its
members to learn what they want most in a new contract. </p>
<p>Striking workers are picketing at several locations around Washington
state, Oregon and California. </p>
<p>Outside Boeing’s huge factory in Everett, Washington, Nancie
Browning, a materials-management specialist at Boeing for more than 17
years, said last week’s offer was worse than the one that prompted a
two-month strike in 2008. She said that without annual bonuses that
workers have come to depend on, the proposed pay increase was more like
9%, not 25%. </p>
<p>“We just want a piece of the pie like everybody else,” she said. “Why
should we work all this overtime and bust our backs while these guys
[Boeing executives] are sitting up in their suites just raking in the
cash?” </p>
<p>The bonuses have emerged as a flash point for union members. Workers
say they range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year. </p>
<p>Boeing says it is hard to calculate bonuses in a way that is fair to
33,000 people who perform different jobs. So instead, the company
proposes to ditch the payouts and replace them with automatic
contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee’s 401(k) retirement
account. </p>
<p>Workers are bitter that in contract extensions over the past 16
years, Boeing ended its traditional pension plan and lowered health care
benefits. </p>
<p>“We want our pension back,” said Jacob Bustad, a machinist with
Boeing for 14 years who was also on the picket line in Everett. “We just
keep losing and we never gain, while the people at the top just get more
and more money. Boeing has done really good for me and my family, but
these last years have been hard.” </p>
<p>Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and
burned through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone as it
stood poised to post another money-losing year. The strike will delay
deliveries of new planes, which are an important source of cash for the
company. </p>
<p>Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division,
cited the company’s $60 billion in total debt in urging blue-collar
workers to accept the contract offer last week. She called it the best
offer Boeing had ever made — and it was endorsed by the union’s local
president and negotiators. </p>
<p>But workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders, which
had not happened since 1995. </p>
<p>Additional cost-cutting moves spelled out in the chief financial
officer’s memo included eliminating first- and business-class service
for anyone on travel that is deemed critical and stopping spending on
outside consultants. </p>
<p>West also said Boeing plans to make “significant reductions in
supplier expenditures” and will stop most supplier purchase orders
related to the 737, 767 and 777 airplane models. </p>
<p>After the strike started, Moody’s put Boeing on review for a possible
credit downgrade, and Fitch said a strike longer than two weeks would
make a downgrade more likely. Both agencies rate Boeing debt one notch
above noninvestment or junk status.</p>

than washing and grooming the body. We usually do it alone, in our
private bathrooms, with locked doors. Seen in a historical context, that
is unusual. Bathing in the presence of others has been the rule rather
than the exception. As late as the first half of the twentieth century,
many households, even in the most advanced industrial societies, did not
have running water at home, let alone a private bathroom.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A bathroom requires a domestic water supply, but also a sewer drain, and
an energy source to heat the water. Of course, it’s possible to have a
hot bath at home without these infrastructures. Ever since Antiquity,
the rich have built private baths in their houses. Most often, they
could do that because less well-off people - either servants or slaves -
filled and emptied their bathtubs with bucketloads of water and
collected firewood to heat them.
</p>
<p>
However, for most people, it was more practical to take their bodies to
the water rather than the other way around. For some, that meant bathing
in rivers, lakes, and springs. For others, especially in urban
environments, it meant visiting the public bathhouse.

<h2 id="is-bathing-unsustainable">
Is Bathing Unsustainable?
</h2>
<p>
Modern bathing practices are a textbook example of an unsustainable
lifestyle based on fossil fuels. Hot water production is the second
largest energy use in many homes (after space heating and/or cooling),
and much of it is used for bathing or showering.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The modern bathroom also uses a lot of water and adds extra energy use
through space heating and waste-water treatment. Building and renovating
bathrooms requires resources, too.
</p>
<p>
Sustainability advocates follow two strategies to address these
problems. The first strategy concentrates on technological solutions,
such as low-flow showerheads, water boilers heated by solar collectors,
waste-water heat recovery systems, and greywater recycling. The second
strategy counts on behavioral or social changes by questioning modern
standards of cleanliness: bathing or showering shorter and less
frequently, taking cold showers, or doing a cat wash at the sink.
<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
These strategies are unlikely to bring much results. Many technological
fixes are difficult or impossible to install in existing buildings,
especially in cities. For example, as the number of floors increases, an
apartment building quickly runs out of roof space to install solar
collectors for all residents. On the other hand, promoting discomfort as
a sacrifice for sustainability is unlikely to engage broader
environmental practices.
<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Communal bathing makes it easier to disconnect bathing practices from
fossil fuels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Communal bathing could be a third approach, but it’s rarely mentioned.
That’s remarkable because, in terms of resource efficiency, it’s hard to
beat. Building and operating a bathhouse for 1,000 people requires much
less energy than building and operating 1,000 individual bathrooms. A
public bathhouse is also more efficient concerning materials, money, and
space.
<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Just as importantly, public bathing makes applying the sustainable
technologies mentioned above more feasible. That further reduces energy
consumption and makes it possible to disconnect bathing practices from
fossil fuels. Finally, a public bathhouse can achieve significantly
improved sustainability without promoting discomfort. On the contrary,
pooling resources to build something for a community rather than for
every household separately allows for a high level of sustainable
extravagance. That may be an easier sell than cold showers.

Bathing in Rivers, Lakes, and Hot Springs
</h2>
<p>
Nature has provided humans with bathing facilities through streams,
rivers, pools, lakes, waterfalls, and rain showers. Humanity spent much
time in tropical Africa, where bathing did not require artificially
heated water for comfort. When we moved into colder climates, Nature
presented us with another solution: hot springs. Many tens of thousands
of thermal springs exist around the planet — only a few present-day
countries lack them entirely.
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bathing in hot springs was common in ancient civilizations all over the
world. However, it’s a practice that goes back even further in time.
Archeological evidence abundantly shows that many prehistoric
settlements established themselves near hot springs.
<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
It’s impossible to prove rock solid that people used those waters for
bathing, but why wouldn’t they, especially in cold regions?
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Enjoying a hot bath is a practice that predates recorded history.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Today’s bathing culture relies on fossil fuels, but if we consider the
historical context, enjoying a hot bath is not unsustainable. In the
case of hot springs, the entire infrastructure and operation — water
supply, drainage, and heat source — are already in place.
</p>
<p>
Our ancestors also invented the steam or sweat bath to take advantage of
cold water in all seasons and climates. Rather than heating water, it
heats people so they can bathe comfortably in cold water. The earliest
steam huts, from prehistoric times, were little more than small log
cabins or tent-like structures covered with woolen blankets or hides.

The Birth of the Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
Artificial bathing facilities made from brick or stone appeared around
4,000 years ago.
<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
They could be an open-air pool, a bathhouse, or a private bathroom. Many
bathhouses and bathing pools were built on top of natural hot springs,
modifying the natural environment to make it more convenient, safe, and
attractive.<sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
People also began to divert water into urban bathing facilities using
canals, pipes, and aqueducts. They started building baths that used
artificially heated water as well.
</p>
<p>
The Ancient Romans are most famously associated with the public
bathhouse, although they took much inspiration from the Ancient Greeks.
Greek bathhouses comprised rooms with individual hip baths against the
walls. Sitting up straight, the bathers threw hot water over themselves
or had this done by a servant. In contrast, Roman bathers shared the
water in large bathtubs or pools. Both used steam baths as well.
<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>

<p>
At the height of the Empire, there were around 1,000 public baths in the
city of Rome alone for a population of about 1 million people - one
bathhouse per 1,000 people.
<sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
The most prominent bathhouses were the “thermae,” which could hold up to
a few thousand people bathing at the same time. These facilities, which
only appeared in the largest cities, were richly decorated with mosaics,
marble floors and pools, granite columns, and statues. However, most
Ancient Roman bathhouses were smaller neighborhood baths called
“balnea.”

The Preindustrial Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
The public bathhouse’s history continues after the Roman Empire’s
demise. In the East, the Roman bathhouse evolved into the hammam, which
ditched the pools and concentrated more on sweating as a cleaning
method.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
After a sweat bath, people threw water over themselves. Reminiscent of
the small Roman baths known as balnea, hammams spread in large numbers
in all cities of the Islamic world as they facilitated bodily
cleanliness and the accomplishment of body ablutions before praying.
<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In Western Europe, many Roman baths fell into disrepair. However, the
public bathhouse returned in full swing during the late Middle Ages,
when a new period of urbanization set in.
<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
In the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, a lot of European cities had a
public bathhouse per 2,000 to 5,000
citizens.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>
Many were steam baths inspired by the hammam. A second type of bathhouse
offered wooden bathtubs to seat a small group of people. The medieval
bathhouse was known as a “stew,” which refers to the oven that either
heated water for the bathtubs or filled the room with steam.

Northern Europe and Russia - never conquered by Roman or Islamic Empires
- stuck to sweat and hot air baths. For example, public “banyas” existed
in towns throughout Muscovy during the Middle Ages.
<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
Asia also developed independent bathing cultures. For instance, in late
medieval Japan, people shared private hot baths among families,
neighbors, and friends for economic reasons. For these “cooperative
baths” of mostly four to ten individuals, every bather brought a portion
of firewood to heat the water. That practice evolved into larger public
baths - “sento” - which experienced rapid growth from the fifteenth
century
onwards.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>

Bathing for Pleasure
</h2>
<p>
Nowadays, sustainability advocates who promote shorter or less frequent
showers implicitly regard bathing as a strictly utilitarian practice.
However, for most of history, bathing was never just about hygiene.
Apart from getting clean, people also visited public baths to relax,
have fun, and socialize. Rather than a quick affair, the bathing process
— no matter its form — often went on for hours.
<sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>

<p>
The Ancient Greeks sat together in individual bathtubs, having
conversations, for which the space’s acoustics were optimally suited.
<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>
In Ancient Rome, public baths were places where people went almost daily
to be seen, mingle, relax, gossip, dine, or play sports and study.
Bathers accessed beauty treatments such as massages, shaving,
hairdressing, and depilating. They celebrated parties and anniversaries
and honored foreign guests.

The medieval European bathhouse continued these traditions with less
splendor but not necessarily with less revelry. In particular, medieval
stews with wooden bathtubs were often a place of amusement that also
furnished food, drink, music, and various types of bodily care.
<sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
In Japan, during the 16th century, public baths became places to gather
and socialize, with large groups of people eating, drinking, and
singing.

River bathing, which continued around cities and in rural areas until
the 20th century, was a kind of play in which swimming was a potential
element.
<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the same time, bathing was considered essential to prevent and cure
diseases, following the Hippocratic ideas that people could maintain or
restore the balance of bodily fluids by exposing the body to cold, hot,
moist, or dry circumstances. The layout of preindustrial baths reflected
these ideas, featuring pools and spaces of different temperatures.

Communal Luxury
</h2>
<p>
While these elements of pleasure, social interaction, and health
continue today in mineral spas, there is a crucial difference with
earlier bathing practices. The present-day spa is far too expensive to
substitute for a private bathroom. In contrast, the historical public
bathhouse was an egalitarian institution.
</p>
<p>
Roman public baths had no or low entrance fees and were open to
everyone. There were no areas reserved for higher-ranking patrons.
Combined with the splendid architecture and opulent decoration of the
baths, this ensured that even the most humble servant would have a taste
of luxury.
<sup id="fnref5:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
These customs continued into the European Middle Ages and were shared by
bathing cultures across the world.
<sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
For example, in Japan, the bathhouse aided in “slowly deconstructing the
existing social hierarchy and created a new cultural flow between the
elite and the commoners.”

The Fuel Use of Roman Bathhouses
</h2>
<p>
How sustainable was that communal luxury? Most research about the energy
use of bathhouses concerns Ancient Roman baths. Historians have
sometimes faulted the large bathhouses from the Empire for their
wastefulness, arguing that their widespread use caused deforestation.
<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>
However, in recent years, archeological research, thermal analysis, and
heat transfer studies have made it increasingly clear that Ancient Roman
bathhouses, in spite of their opulence, were remarkably energy-efficient
buildings.
<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first reason was the hypocaust system. It consisted of one or more
underground furnaces that distributed hot air under the floor and into
the hollow walls (some baths had heated ceilings, too). Because of the
large radiant surfaces, the spaces in the building could be heated at a
lower temperature, saving energy. Although the water for the pools was
reheated periodically in an insulated boiler close to the furnace, the
heat in the floors and the walls helped to keep it warm for an extended
period.
<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A study of the Stabian Baths, one of the oldest surviving thermae, shows
a fuel consumption of between 5 and 8 kg of firewood per hour, depending
on the season.

That corresponds to a wood supply of slightly more than 60 ash trees per
year, which was unlikely to cause deforestation.
<sup id="fnref3:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
Firewood consumption was probably even lower because Roman baths
routinely supplemented wood with other locally available fuels, often
waste products: reeds, harvest by-products (olive pits, orchard
trimmings, chaff), and animal wastes (dung and bones).
<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Many Roman baths were heated almost exclusively by solar energy on sunny
days.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Following the same methodology, a study of a later bathing complex - the
Forum Baths in Ostia - shows that the Romans continued improving their
bathhouses’ energy efficiency.
<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>
The Forum Baths were three times larger than the Stabian Baths - 923m2
versus 310m2 of heated spaces - but their calculated annual wood
consumption is not even twice as high: roughly 100 trees per year.
<sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref4:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
The newer bathhouse had thicker walls (two meters instead of one meter),
as well as much larger glazed windows, which increased the share of
solar radiation.
<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>
Earlier research has shown that the Forum baths were heated almost
exclusively by solar energy on sunny days.
<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The studies above assume that the Romans heated their baths for 24 hours
daily and only shut them down for maintenance. Roman bathhouses likely
continued to be heated through the night, as it was more practical and
energy-efficient. Many baths were open daily, and it could take a whole
day to heat them from a cold state. In later centuries, medieval stews
and hammams often used the heat or the ashes of the furnace to bake
bread and other foods at night.
<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>
Hammams and medieval stews were less energy-efficient than Roman baths.
Hammams had heated floors but no heated walls and few windows, while
medieval stews often had none of these.

Roman Bathhouse Versus Private Shower
</h2>
<p>
How does the energy use of the Roman bathhouse compare to that of the
modern shower? Academic research does not provide an answer, but a quick
calculation shows that the Roman bathing experience, which lasted for
hours, was more energy-efficient than the present-day private shower,
which lasts, on average, 9 minutes. The daily energy use of the Forum
baths corresponds to the daily energy use of 557 showers.
<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>
While we don’t know how many people visited the Forum Baths daily, they
likely surpassed that number: the baths could host up to 500 bathers
simultaneously.
<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

energy-efficient than the present-day private shower, which lasts, on
average, 9 minutes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Furthermore, in the calculation above, the energy use for the shower
only concerns water heating, while the fuel use for the public baths
also - and mainly - includes space heating.
<sup id="fnref5:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
For example, assuming that the water in the pools of the Stabian baths
was changed only once per day, heating the water accounted for less than
10% of the total energy use, corresponding to the energy use of only 52
showers. The low energy use for water heating is partly explained by the
excellent thermal insulation of the heated floors and walls, meaning
that space and water heating cannot be separated. However, it is also
because the Romans shared the water in pools, while every shower
requires freshly heated water.
</p>
<p>
The Roman bathhouse also compares favorably to the typical backyard
sauna, for which the fuel consumption hovers between 5 and 15kg of
firewood per session.
<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>
Only sixteen such sauna sessions require as much fuel as the Stabian
baths used daily. The sauna has no heated floor and walls. Furthermore,
historically, it was often built partly underground to save fuel, but
nowadays, it’s usually a badly insulated building standing in a cold
climate.

The Public Baths of the Industrial Revolution
</h2>
<p>
Bathing practices have changed quite a lot since Roman and late medieval
times, particularly in most of the Western world. Few of us will have
the time or even the need to linger in a bathhouse for several hours
daily, and some of us may feel uncomfortable bathing in public.
<sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>
However, a bathhouse can also take a form more in line with modern
bathing habits. The public bathhouse of the Industrial Revolution
demonstrates this.
</p>
<p>
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, cities received large
numbers of immigrants who came to work in factories. Most of these
people were housed in overcrowded tenement buildings without running
water, leading to unsanitary conditions.
<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
Recurring epidemics and new medical insights led to a “gospel of
cleanliness” that resulted in a new wave of public bathhouses across the
Western world. Many of these baths only disappeared between the 1950s
and 1980s.
</p>
<p>
The public hygiene movement began in England and peaked there in the
1840s. By 1896, more than 200 municipalities in Britain were maintaining
public baths. The English bathhouse emulated the splendor of Roman baths
in its architecture and decoration: it was “large, handsome, and
costly.”
<sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
However, it did not copy the Ancient bathing customs. It now reserved
different sections of the bathhouse for different social classes.
Furthermore, while the pools still provided social interaction, the
bathtubs were now placed in individual compartments. Finally, the modern
bathhouse instituted maximum time limits for using the pool and the
bathtubs.
<sup id="fnref2:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup><sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>

The Shower Bathhouse
</h2>
<p>
Germany, the first to follow the British on the continent, also built
monumental bathhouses.
<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>
However, in the 1880s, Berlin physician Oscar Lasser argued that the
large baths were too costly to build in the necessary numbers. He
proposed the introduction of smaller bathhouses with nothing but showers
in individual compartments. Until then, the shower was only attached to
a bathtub or used in barracks and prisons, where soldiers and inmates
were showered with cold water.
<sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The shower bathhouse became the dominant public bath type in most of
Western Europe and also in North America, where the sanitary reform
movement took off in the 1890s.
<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup><sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>
It cleared away the last vestiges of the Ancient bathing culture by
ditching the pools and switching to a more practical architecture. For
better or worse, the public bathhouse from the Industrial Revolution was
the “antithesis of the preindustrial bathhouse.”
<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
Although bathers still made use of communal infrastructure, there was no
more space for pleasure, social interaction, public nakedness, and
social mixing.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

was the antithesis of the preindustrial bathhouse.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the higher social classes gradually gained access to their private
water supply and bathrooms, the public bath became increasingly
associated with poverty. Although shower bathhouses did not have
separate sections for different social classes, they were mainly built
in low-income neighborhoods, aimed at the poor only. Bathers were led to
their shower cubicle by an attendant, who opened the tap, decided on the
water temperature, and started a timer. People had at most 20 minutes to
undress, shower, and dress
again.<sup id="fnref4:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>

Bring Back the Public Bathhouse?
</h2>
<p>
In Europe and North America, the public bathhouse disappeared once
everyone got their private bathroom - although we still bathe together
in sports centers and continue using communal bathrooms in hostels or
campings. The public bathhouse survives elsewhere but is in decline
almost everywhere. For example, Cairo had only eight hammams in 2000,
compared to more than seventy at the beginning of the 19th
century.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>
In 1968, greater Tokyo boasted 2,687 public bathhouses. In 2022, only
462 were left.
<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup><sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Historically, the bathhouse was born out of the need for efficiency:
bathing was too resource-intensive to organize individually. That is no
longer the case thanks to the advance of central infrastructures -
fossil fuels, electricity, water supply, sewers. However, in the context
of the present environmental crisis, the resource efficiency of the
public bathhouse has become relevant once again. It’s a solution that
could reduce energy use relatively quickly without the need for new
technologies or sacrificing comfort. Resilience is another argument for
the bathhouse.

What Type of Public Bathhouse Do We Want?
</h2>
<p>
The metamorphosis of the public bath in the 19th and 20th centuries,
which also affected public baths outside the Western world, presents a
challenge to anyone wanting to revive public bathing for sustainability.
What type of bathhouse do we want? Of course, the Roman bath and the
shower bathhouse are both extremes, and many intermediate forms are
imaginable. Nevertheless, any designer of a future bathhouse will have
to make decisions that are likely to be controversial.
</p>
<p>
For example, one could argue that the shower bathhouse not only fits
modern bathing practices but also maximizes resource efficiency. That is
especially true when the government, rather than the bather, controls
shower duration and water temperature. In that way, the public bathhouse
could become a technology to enforce frugality upon the whole
population. However, to put it mildly, such an approach is unlikely to
generate enthusiasm for reviving public bathhouses. Neither does it do
much to improve social interaction.
<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Advocating for the return of the preindustrial public bathhouse, which
centers around social interaction and communal luxury, may be more
successful in luring people away from their private bathrooms, but it
also runs into obstacles. The public bathhouse has faced resistance for
2,000 years, mostly because of conflicting views about health and
morals.
<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>
For example, concerns about debauchery and prostitution - real and
imagined - run throughout the history of the bathhouse in all cultures.
<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>
Separating males and females does not fully address those worries.

<p>
Any plea for reviving public baths will also have to deal with the fear
of contagious disease. For example, a “lockdown” of society, as many
governments applied during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and 2021, is
incompatible with public bathhouses. Such a measure only works when
everybody has a private bathroom.
<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>
The link between communal bathing and health is complex. Science has
confirmed many of the health benefits of cold, hot, and steam baths and
has also shown the importance of social interaction. However, bringing
people together will always raise health risks, too.
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-a-low-tech-bathhouse">
How to Build a Low-tech Bathhouse?
</h2>
<p>
There’s another distinction between bathhouses built before and after
the Industrial Revolution: preindustrial baths worked with renewable
fuels, while industrial baths ran on fossil fuels. Many modern
bathhouses had an on-site coal power plant, which heated the space and
the water and provided electricity for lighting. Fossil fuel-powered
bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil fuel-powered private
bathrooms, but we can do better than that.
</p>
<p>
A large bathhouse heated by a hypocaust system and large windows is
still hard to beat as a carbon neutral technology, at least based on
sustainable wood production.
<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup><sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>
However, biomass combustion creates air pollution, while we could also
power a bathhouse with renewable energy sources that don’t have that
problem. The most apparent solution for space and water heating is flat
plate solar collectors in which the sun heats water. Heat-generating
windmills are a low-tech alternative to solar thermal collectors in less
sunny climates.
<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>
Other potential heat sources are geothermal energy and factory waste
heat.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fossil fuel-powered bathhouses are more energy efficient than fossil
fuel-powered private bathrooms, but we can do better than that.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A solar or wind-powered bathhouse’s biggest drawback is its dependency
on favorable weather conditions. To compensate for that, solar or wind
power can be combined with thermal energy storage, such as insulated
water tanks. Storing heat in a thermal mass for longer periods is much
cheaper and more sustainable than storing electricity in chemical
batteries. However, it requires space that only communal bathing can
offer. Steam baths and saunas are more difficult to disconnect from
biomass combustion, but some innovative examples exist.
<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Clustering bathing facilities in a shared infrastructure also creates
sufficient space for a bathhouse to have extensive heat insulation (a
decisive factor in energy consumption) and provide for its water supply
(for example, by catching and storing rainwater) as well as wastewater
treatment (for example through phytoremediation using plants).
</p>
<p>
Architects have applied some of these ideas in countries where public
baths are still used. For example, in a mountain village in China, a
community bathhouse for 5,000 people is largely off-the-grid, pumping up
its water from a well, heating it with solar collectors, and filtering
the run-off wastewater from the showers and the toilets in basins filled
with bamboo plants.
<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>

</div>
<p>
However, a public bathhouse also fits the more high-tech vision of a
centralized energy infrastructure based on solar PV panels and wind
turbines that provide electricity. In such a configuration, public
bathhouses could absorb excess electricity during abundantly sunny or
windy days. Rather than curtailing the electricity from surplus solar
and wind power, we could use it to power electric heat pumps and store
the heat in the thermal mass of public baths.
<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>
While this approach is less resource-efficient than off-grid bathhouses
operating without electricity, it still beats a scenario in which a
centralized renewable power grid supplies energy to many private
bathrooms.

The spread of water supply and sewer networks took a lot of time,
especially in older European cities. Before 1900, only the most
expensive Paris flats had a bathroom.
<sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Plumbed-in
private baths appeared in the wealthiest British households in the
1860s. Still, it was not until the 1950s that working-class homes were
routinely supplied with hot and cold running water.
<sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In
the newer cities of the USA, installing a water supply and sewer
infrastructure was easier. From the 1870s, American plumbing outstripped
that of every other country. More than half of all American houses had a
complete bathroom in 1940. For comparison, in the whole of France, only
one house or apartment in ten had a shower or bath in 1954.

How much water public bathing can save depends on how exactly people
bathe together. Shared pools and bathtubs bring water savings, but
individual showers and bathtubs do not, even if placed in a communal

The first written reference to the steam bath dates back to the fifth
century BC, when Greek historian Herodotus compared the Scythian sweat
bath north of the Black sea to the Greek steam bath of his time.
However, it’s very likely that its origins go back to prehistoric times.
Not surprisingly, the steam bath and the hot air bath initially spread
in regions with cold and long winters: northwestern Europe, Russia,
Alaska, and Canada. It was also used by Native Americans, and spread to
Central and South America as well.

One of the earliest archeological records of human-made bathing
facilities dates back to around 2300 BC in what is now Pakistan. The
inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro, the probable capital of the Indus
civilization, built wells and drainage systems allowing for private
bathrooms in most residential buildings, as well as a large, communal
bathing pool. The private bathrooms had a 1m2 shallow platform, where
people threw buckets of water over themselves. The “Great Bath” was a
brick basin with steps on either side and a capacity for 160 m3 of
water. As the city was located in a hot desert climate, there was no
need for heating the water. Sources: Graeber, David, and David Wengrow.

The egalitarian nature of the public bath was reinforced by the fact
that people were partly or completely naked. “One stripped not only of
their clothes but also of their social rank and material wealth, which
become largely invisible”, concludes a historian of the Japanese public
bath.

The study assumes that the baths were heated for 24 hours per day and
only shut down for maintenance. The fuel used for heating up the bath
initially (calculated at 35 kg in the case of the Stabian Baths) is
added only once to the total yearly energy use. The results are also
based on the assumption that the water of the baths was changed once per
day (and thus had to be heated from a cold state once per
day). <a href="#fnref:37" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

Whether or not the (small) windows in the Stabian baths had glass or
shutters is not entirely clear. The study concludes that energy use is
pretty similar with both glazed and unglazed windows. However, the Forum
baths, with windows several meters high, would have required almost 1.5
times more wood to heat rooms with unglazed windows during the month of
May, and more than twice as much in the coldest
month. <a href="#fnref:40" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

A fuel use of 7.5 to 12 kg/hr averages at 9.75 kg/hr, which corresponds
to 234 kg firewood per day. One kg of wood contains roughly 5 kWh of
thermal energy, which brings the daily fuel use of the Forum baths to
1,170 kWh. A shower of 8.9 minutes (the average in the netherlands)
takes 2.1 kWh of thermal energy.
<sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Conclusion: the daily energy use of the Forum Baths equals that of 557
showers. The daily fuel use of the smaller and less energy efficient
Stabian baths corresponds to the energy use of 378
showers. <a href="#fnref:43" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

The energy use of a sauna is more variable than the energy use of a
shower, and I could not find any reliable academic research. The data I
use are a rough estimation based on numbers that I found on internet
forums and websites. Also note that climate explains part of the
difference in energy efficiency: the sauna is often located in a cold
climate, while most Roman baths stood around the
Mediterranean. <a href="#fnref:45" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

The Stuttgart Bathhouse, for example, had two large pools, 300 dressing
rooms, 102 bath tubs, two Russian-Roman baths, two cold water baths, a
sun bath, and a bath for dogs. By the end of the century, almost every
German city had erected at least one monumental bathhouse, which often
included a restaurant and barber shop as well.

This is especially true in Western Europe, where opposition grew so
strong that the bathhouse eventually disappeared in some regions between
the sixteenth and the nineteenth century.
<sup id="fnref8:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
The reasons for the temporal demise of bathing in Western Europe - a
unique event in world history - are controversial among historians. Some
point to the pressure of the Catholic and Protestant church, who
increasingly perceived the medieval stews as places of immorality and
sin.
<sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>
Others see the cause in epidemics, or point to changing medical views -
doctors no longer considered hot water and steam healthy.
<sup id="fnref9:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
Opposition started even before organized religion appeared. Ancient
Roman philosopher Seneca was critical of the larger Roman baths and
wrote several rants against them. He complained about the noise in the
thermae, and accused them of extravagance and hedonism. See, for
example: Moral letters to Lucilius by Seneca. Letter 86. On Scipio’s
villa.
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_86</a> <a href="#fnref:58" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

In Ancient Rome, some bathhouses allowed mixed bathing, while others
separated male and female bathers. Prostitution was legal, but the fact
that a man’s wife had bathed with other men was a legitimate reason for
divorce.
<sup id="fnref9:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>
In Muslim Spain, substantial fines were assessed to men who either
slipped into the bathhouse on days assigned to women, or who were caught
spying through the windows of the structure. Women risked their legal
rights if they did the same. Abusing a woman in a bathhouse, even
verbally, carried the death penalty. See: Powers, James F. “Frontier
municipal baths and social interaction in thirteenth-century Spain.” The
American Historical Review 84.3 (1979): 649.667. In the Low Countries
during the middle ages, authorities distinguished “honest” from
“dishonest” stews. To maintain the quality of the “honest” bathhouses,
they abolished, mixed bathing, set rules for bathmaids, and made
prostitution in the bathhouse illegal.

There’s no doubt that public bathhouses were a vector in historical
epidemics. Medical tracts even advised against visiting the bathhouse.
However, almost all baths remained open, very likely because they were
seen as a service too essential to withdraw. At least, that was the case
in the medieval Low Countries and in the Roman Empire, see:

Moreover, the hypocaust was further improved in the middle ages, meaning
that it could be made even more energy efficient than in Roman times.

For example, researchers at the University of Stuttgart have devised a
hybrid storage system consisting of a pressurized water and steam tank
that serves as a storage for solar energy. The steam can be released in
a sauna anytime, while the water serves to heat the space. See:

A very low-tech example is “Solauna”, which works with solar heat alone,
basically by building a very large and well-insulated solar box cooker.

id="releasing-windows-as-open-source-is-the-only-viable-way-forward-for-microsoft-and-its-going-happen">Releasing
Windows as open source is the only viable way forward for Microsoft, and
it’s going happen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week, Julio Merino published an article I wish someone had
written ages ago: a fair, unbiased look at the differences between
Windows NT in its original form and UNIX roughly at the time of the
initial releases of Windows NT. Merino, who has a long career in tech
and has made contributions to several operating systems, does a great
job cutting through the fanboyism and decades’ worth of conventional
wisdom, arriving at the following conclusion that I think many of us
here will share even without diving into the great depth of his article.
NT was groundbreaking technology when it launched. As I presented above,
many of the features we take for granted today in systems design were
present in NT since its inception, whereas almost all other Unix systems
had to gain those features slowly over time. As a result, such features
don’t always integrate seamlessly with Unix philosophies. Today,
however, it’s not clear to me that NT is truly “more advanced” than,
say, Linux or FreeBSD. It is true that NT had more solid design
principles at the onset and more features that its contemporary
operating systems, but nowadays… the differences are blurry. Yes, NT is
advanced, but not significantly more so than modern Unixes. What I find
disappointing is that, even though NT has all these solid design
principles in place… bloat in the UI doesn’t let the design shine
through. The sluggishness of the OS even on super-powerful machines
is painful to witness and might even lead to the demise of this OS. ↫
Julio Merino You should definitely read the whole thing, and not just
the conclusion, as it will give you some great insight into some of the
differences between the two approaches, and how the UNIX and Windows NT
worlds learned from each other and grew together. It’s well-written,
easy to read, and contains a ton of information and details about
especially Windows NT most people are probably not aware of. Reading
through the article helped my crystallise a set of thoughts I’ve been
having about the future of Windows, and in particular, the future of
Windows NT as a short-hand for the kernel, lower-level frameworks, and
everything else below the graphical layer. I think there’s a major
change coming to Windows NT, something so big and unheard of it’s going
to be the most defining moment in Windows NT history since its very
first release. There’s a few facts that lie at the root of my
conclusion. First, ever since the very beginning, Windows NT has been
developed in roughly the same way: behind closed doors by a group of
specialists inside Microsoft, and every now and then we got a massive
dump of new code in the form of a major Windows release. It’s only
recently that Microsoft has started taking a more rolling release
approach to Windows development, with smaller updates peppered
throughout the year, with different release branches users can subscribe
to. Second, despite many of us almost equating Microsoft with Windows –
or perhaps with Windows and Office – the reality of it is that Windows
hasn’t been the primary driver for revenue for Microsoft for a while
now. In Microsoft’s fiscal year of 2023, Windows made up just 10% of the
company’s total revenue that year, which amounts to $22 billion out of a
total revenue of $211 billion. Azure alone is almost four times as large
at $80 billion, and even LinkedIn – yes, LinkedIn – is good for $15
billion in revenue, making Windows only about a third more profitable
than the most soulless social network in human history. Third, despite
Windows’ decreasing revenue share, the operating system is becoming ever
larger in scope. Not only does it need to cover the literally infinite
possible combinations of x86 hardware in both the desktop/laptop and
server space, it now also needs to cover what is surely going to be a
growing market for ARM hardware, starting with laptops, but surely
expanding to desktops and servers, too. Microsoft needs to foot the bill
for all of this development, and for how much longer can the company
justify spending an inordinate amount of money on a massive army of
Windows developers, when the revenue they bring in is such a small part
of the company, and a part that’s decreasing every year, to boot?
Fourth, the competition Windows faces is surprisingly strong. Not only
are macOS, Chrome OS, and even the Linux desktop doing better than ever,
mobile computing is also competing with Windows, and that’s a space
Microsoft is simply not present in at all. This is especially pressing
in the developing world, where often people’s first and only computing
experience is mobile – through Android, mostly – and Microsoft and
Windows simply don’t play any role. Given these facts, there’s only one
reasonable course of action for Microsoft. I think the company is going
to address all of these issues by releasing large parts of Windows NT as
open source. I base this on a gut feeling bourne out of the above facts,
and not on any form of insider information, and there is a 99.9% chance
that I am wholly, completely, and utterly wrong. Still, deep down, I
feel like releasing Windows as open source makes the most sense
considering the challenges the operating system and its parent company
are facing. You and I are going to witness Windows NT’s source code
being published as open source on GitHub by Microsoft within 5-7 years,
accompanied by an open governance model wherein contributions are
welcomed and encouraged. Even if such a step will not be taken by
Microsoft, I am convinced that, in the future, when today’s employees
and executives write and publish their memoirs, it will contain a lot of
discourse on the very serious consideration that took place within the
company in the past to do so. You can quote me on this. And then laugh
at me when it inevitable turns out I’m wrong.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-completes-withdrawal-from-junta-ruled-niger">US
military completes withdrawal from junta-ruled Niger</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DAKAR, Senegal — The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger is
complete, an American official said Monday. </p>
<p>A small number of military personnel assigned to guard the U.S.
Embassy remain, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Niger’s ruling junta ended an agreement that
allowed U.S. troops to operate in the West African country. A few months
later, officials from both countries said in a joint statement that U.S.
troops would complete their withdrawal by the middle of September. </p>
<p>The U.S. handed over its last military bases in Niger to local
authorities last month, but about two dozen American soldiers had
remained in Niger, largely for administrative duties related to the
withdrawal, Singh said. </p>
<p>Niger’s ouster of American troops following a coup last year has
broad ramifications for Washington because it’s forcing troops to
abandon critical bases that were used for counterterrorism missions in
the Sahel. groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group operate
in the vast region south of the Sahara desert. </p>
<p>One of those groups, Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, known as
JNIM, is active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and is looking to
expand into Benin and Togo. </p>
<p>Niger had been seen as one of the last nations in the restive region
that Western nations could partner with to beat back growing jihadi
insurgencies. The U.S. and France had more than 2,500 military personnel
in the region until recently, and together with other European countries
had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance and
training. </p>
<p>In recent months Niger has pulled away from its Western partners,
turning instead to Russia for security. In April, Russian military
trainers arrived in Niger to reinforce the country’s air defenses.</p>

city cancels cultural festival after political furor over Haitians</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Springfield, Ohio — An Ohio city at the center of a political furor
over Haitian migrants canceled its annual celebration of cultural
diversity on Monday in response to days of violent threats that have
closed schools and government offices. The governor, meanwhile, said
resources would be surged to Springfield to help city officials deal
with the fallout.</p>
<p>Springfield’s two-day CultureFest, which highlights diversity, arts
and culture, had been scheduled to begin Sept. 27 but was canceled “in
light of recent threats and safety concerns,” the city announced.</p>
<p>“We deeply regret having to cancel CultureFest, as we know it is a
beloved event for our community,” City Manager Bryan Heck said in a
statement. “However, the safety of our residents and visitors must come
first.”</p>
<p>Springfield has been the focus of intense attention in recent days
after former President Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance, and the
Republican presidential campaign have amplified debunked claims about
Haitian immigrants eating domestic pets and waterfowl.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has denounced the false rumors,
saying there is no evidence of it. He said at a news conference in
Springfield on Monday that dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway
Patrol will be stationed in Springfield schools starting Tuesday,
sweeping each building every morning before the arrival of faculty or
students. Security cameras have also been stationed at various spots in
the city.</p>
<p>Springfield City Hall, several schools, and state motor vehicle
offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving
bomb threats. At least 33 separate bomb threats were made in recent
days, all of them hoaxes, DeWine said. He said some of the threats came
from overseas but declined to name the country.</p>
<p>“We cannot let the bad guys win. Our schools must remain open. They
are going to remain open,” DeWine said.</p>
<p>Two colleges in Springfield held classes virtually on Monday.
Wittenberg University said it received two threats over the weekend,
“both of which were targeted toward members of the Haitian Community.”
Clark State College said it would operate virtually through Friday “due
to recent events in Springfield.”</p>
<p>Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the
predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles
(70 kilometers) from the state capital of Columbus, where they have
found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill
job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care
facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, appearing in Philadelphia at the National HBCU
Week Conference on Monday, addressed the situation in Springfield,
condemning what he called the “lies and hate.”</p>
<p>“It’s wrong. It’s simply wrong. And it must stop,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="a-california-port-gambles-on-dirty-hydrogen">A California Port
Gambles on Dirty Hydrogen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Officials at the Port of Stockton, an inland port in the Central Valley
of California, were facing a problem. Under pressure from California
regulators to convert all port vehicles to zero-emissions models over
the next decade or so, they had made some progress, but had hit a wall.
</p>
<p>
“Right now we only have one tool, and that is to electrify everything,”
Jeff Wingfield, the port’s deputy director, told me. The Port of
Stockton has actually been something of a national leader in
electrifying its vehicles, having converted about 40% of its
cargo-handling equipment from diesel-powered to battery-electric
machines to date. But there aren’t electric alternatives available for
everything yet, and the electric machines they’ve purchased have come
with challenges. Sensors have malfunctioned due to colder weather or
moisture in the air. Maintenance can’t be done by just any mechanic; the
equipment is computerized and requires knowledge of the underlying code.
“We’ve had a lot of downtime with the equipment unnecessarily. And so
when we’re trying to sell that culture change, you know, these things
can set back the mindset and just the overall momentum,” said Wingfield.
</p>
<p>
The port also needs its tenant companies to make the switch, but
according to Wingfield, they are hesitant to invest in the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224576/tesla-semi-crash-fire-highway-california-i-80" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric
truck models</u></a> available today. They’re more interested in
hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, he said, which are also zero-emissions, and
there’s even a vendor selling them right down the street. The problem
was there was no source of hydrogen within an hour and a half of the
port.
</p>
<p>
It was these conditions that got Wingfield and his colleagues excited
about BayoTech, a company that wanted to build a new hydrogen plant
there — even though BayoTech was going to make hydrogen from methane,
the main component of natural gas, in a carbon emissions-intensive
process. Hydrogen fuel-cell powered trucks don’t release any of the
carbon or toxic pollutants that diesel trucks release, but the process
of making the hydrogen fuel can still be dirty.
</p>
<p>
While the port was considering BayoTech’s proposal, California
leadership was committing the state to building out a climate-friendly
hydrogen industry. In July, the Biden administration
<a href="https://archesh2.org/arches-officially-launches/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>awarded
California $1.2 billion</u></a> for a $12.6 billion plan to build new,
zero-emissions hydrogen supply chains. “California is revolutionizing
how a major world economy can clean up its biggest industries,” Governor
Gavin Newsom said. “We’re going to use clean, renewable hydrogen to
power our ports and public transportation – getting people and goods
where they need to go, just without the local air pollution.”
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, the port approved the fossil fuel-based hydrogen plant in
August.
</p>
<p>
The case illustrates the complexities of this moment in the energy
transition. At its center is a question: Should we gamble with higher
emissions today on the premise that it could help lower emissions in the
future? It’s a gamble that many climate advocates, guided by warnings
from scientists about the consequences of continued fossil fuel use,
fear will do more harm than good.
</p>
<p>
The port, which was the lead agency for the environmental review
process,
<a href="https://www.portofstockton.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Recirculated-Draft-Initial-Study%E2%80%94Mitigate-Negative-Declaration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated</u></a>
that if all of the fuel BayoTech produced was used as a replacement for
diesel, it would result in a net decrease in emissions of 4,317 metric
tons of CO2 per year, which is like taking 1,000 cars off the road.
Still, the plant will emit about 18 kilograms of carbon for every
kilogram of hydrogen it produces — more than four times higher than
<a href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/library/policies-acts/clean-hydrogen-production-standard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Department of Energy’s standard for “clean” hydrogen</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Climate and environmental groups in Stockton oppose the project. They’ve
raised a number of concerns about it and the conditions under which it
was approved, but one is the missed opportunity. “At a time when
incentives are lining up for cleaner production methods,” Davis Harper,
the carbon and energy program manager at the local group Restore the
Delta, told me, “and at a time when the state in particular is really
trying to transition away from methane, to approve a new steam methane
reforming project in a community that’s already suffering from so many
cumulative impacts of industrial pollution — it’s a major regression.”
</p>
<p>
Between operations at the port, highways, warehouses, and other
industrial activity, Stockton
<a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/census-tract/6077000100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ranks
in the 96th percentile for pollution burden</u></a> in California, and
in the 100th percentile for cases of asthma. In addition to carbon
dioxide, the BayoTech plant will release nitrogen oxides, carbon
monoxide, and particulate matter. Harper and other local advocates want
the community to have more of a say in shaping regional economic
development and defining what its hydrogen future looks like. “I think
it puts a stain on what the opportunity for hydrogen might be in the
community,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But Wingfield told me it wasn’t an either/or scenario. “I mean, nobody
was approaching us with a green hydrogen project,” he said. Even if
someone was, Wingfield said green hydrogen was still too expensive and
that no one would buy it. The port is supporting state-wide efforts to
develop a more sustainable supply of hydrogen in the future, he said,
“but it is slow, and for us, we need something now.”
</p>
<p>
There’s a chicken-and-egg challenge to getting a clean hydrogen economy
going. In addition to a new supply of fuel, it will require investments
in new vehicles, fueling stations, and modes of delivering the gas — and
that’s just for trucking. Decarbonization experts also see potential to
use hydrogen for cargo ships, steelmaking, and aviation. “I agree, you
know, don’t wait around for the green projects that are being planned to
come online,” Lew Fulton, the director of the energy futures research
program at the U.C. Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, told me.
“There’s a whole bunch of things we need to learn by doing. And so from
that point of view, you could argue, well, in the first few years, it
doesn’t matter that much what kind of hydrogen it is.”
</p>
<p>
When I asked Catharine Reid, BayoTech’s chief marketing officer, what
brought the company to Stockton, she told me California is a key market
and the San Joaquin Valley is currently a dead-zone for the fuel. The
Regional Transit District recently purchased five new fuel-cell buses,
but to fuel them, it will have to truck in hydrogen from other parts of
the state. BayoTech’s business model is designed to address this kind of
local need. The company builds small, modular plants and sites them as
close to the point of consumption as possible to avoid the cost and
emissions associated with transporting the fuel. The project in Stockton
will produce just 2 tons of hydrogen per day, or enough to fill the
tanks of about 50 trucks. By contrast, the average hydrogen plant in
California, which mostly delivers the gas to oil refineries and
fertilizer plants,
<a href="https://bof.fire.ca.gov/media/10190/introduction-to-the-hydrogen-market-in-california-draft-for-comment_ada.pdf" target="_blank"><u>produces
closer to 200 tons per day</u></a>. “We anticipate that that demand will
be snapped up quickly,” said Reid.
</p>
<p>
The port approved the plant using an abbreviated environmental review
process — another aspect that troubled the advocates I spoke to — which
required BayoTech to mitigate some of its most significant impacts. To
reduce pollution, the company will install equipment that cuts the
plant’s nitrogen oxide emissions. It has also committed to using
zero-emissions vehicles for at least 50% of deliveries. But the biggest
pollutant that will come out of the plant is carbon dioxide — just over
12,000 metric tons of it per year. That’s not much compared to the
average hydrogen plant. The smallest existing hydrogen plant in
California, Air Products’ Sacramento facility, has the capacity to
produce more than twice as much hydrogen as BayoTech will, but emitted
nearly four times as much carbon in 2021,
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/carb-pollution-mapping-tool" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to state data</u></a>. One of BayoTech’s selling points is its
technology’s efficiency.
</p>
<p>
The company has also committed to developing a community benefits plan,
which is still in the works, though BayoTech has already signed an
agreement to use local union labor and committed to donate $200,000 over
the next four years to the community.
</p>
<p>
Part of BayoTech’s agreement with the port is that it will lower its
emissions by
<a href="https://blog.bayotech.us/book-and-claim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>purchasing
carbon credits from producers of so-called “renewable natural
gas,”</u></a> or RNG, which can mean methane captured from landfills or
from cow manure pits. It’s considered low-carbon because the methane
would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, where it would warm the
planet far more than carbon dioxide. In theory, credit sales help
finance systems to capture the gas and use it for energy instead.
</p>
<p>
I asked Reid why, when there was so much focus on and funding available
for clean hydrogen, like California’s $12.6 billion initiative and
lucrative new federal tax credits, the company was investing in the
fossil-fueled kind. She suggested that once the federal tax credit rules
are finalized, the plant may in fact be eligible for the subsidies.
That’s because the guidelines might allow hydrogen plants that buy RNG
credits to qualify. “It’s a well established system that’s validated,”
Reid said of the credits, “and the environmental benefits are there.”
</p>
<p>
It’s true that this system of RNG credits is well-established. It’s
already written into California climate policy. The state has a low
carbon fuel standard designed to drive down the average carbon intensity
of transportation fuels over time. When it comes to calculating the
carbon intensity of hydrogen for the regulations, there’s a workaround.
If the hydrogen is made from natural gas, but the supplier purchases RNG
credits, they can report their hydrogen as having a very low or even
<em><em>negative</em></em> carbon intensity.
</p>
<p>
But the environmental benefits of these credits are the subject of much
debate. Notably, fuel producers can buy credits from all over the
country, and they don’t have to prove that their purchase had an
additional effect on emissions beyond what might have happened
otherwise. Though these credits may have some environmental benefit,
they are certainly not causing carbon to be removed from the atmosphere,
as implied by a negative carbon intensity. In an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hydrogen-tax-credit-final-methane-offsets" target="_self"><u>op-ed
for Heatmap</u></a>, scholars Emily Grubert and Danny Cullenward urged
the Treasury Department not to adopt this same carbon accounting scheme
for the federal tax credit, writing that it “would undermine the tax
credit’s entire purpose.” They estimate that a fossil hydrogen project
could qualify as zero-emissions by offsetting just 25% of its natural
gas use. This could make it much harder for truly green hydrogen — like
the kind made from electricity and water — to compete.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, California’s new $12.6 billion clean hydrogen initiative
appears to renounce RNG credits. A
<a href="https://archesh2.org/publications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frequently
asked questions page</u></a> for the plan says that it “will not include
the use of plastics, dairy biogas, or fossil methane paired with
biomethane credits.”
</p>
<p>
Still, the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic
Development praised the BayoTech project in public comments, writing
that it would “contribute to achieving California’s ambitious climate
and pollution reduction goals.”
</p>
<p>
The letter seemed to be mistaken about what it was supporting, however,
noting that the facility would “utilize woody biomass, helping to
address two needs — utilization of a waste stream and production of
renewable hydrogen.” When I reached out to the governor’s office,
spokesperson Willie Rudman told me the reference to woody biomass was an
accident, “resulting from a mix-up with another project.” Still, the
office supports the project, he said, due to “commitments made by the
developer to utilize renewable natural gas as the feedstock, which can
be transported to the production facility via existing natural gas
pipelines.”
</p>
<p>
When I noted that this, too, was a mix-up, and that BayoTech would be
buying RNG credits, not using the fuel directly, Rudman responded that
this was a cost-effective and perfectly acceptable practice under
California’s low-carbon fuel standard.
</p>
<p>
If you view BayoTech’s plant as a bridge to get the hydrogen economy
underway, Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the
University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the
Environment, told me, it’s important to know how to get to the other
side. “Is this just a lifeline for the oil and gas industry, to give
them another product that they can sell, which those profits then go
back into drilling more oil and gas?” He said he wasn’t categorically
opposed to the idea of using natural gas to produce hydrogen for now, as
long as there were built-in mechanisms to convert the facility to
zero-emissions down the line.
</p>
<p>
Wingfield of the Port of Stockton asserted that BayoTech’s plant would
become cleaner over time, but the port has no such commitment in
writing, and it’s also not entirely clear how. BayoTech’s Reid was not
sure whether the Stockton plant would find a local source of RNG. She
said the company was looking, but that it was rare to find alignment
between BayoTech’s business model — putting hydrogen production very
close to demand — and RNG suppliers. The only other route to cleaner
production, other than completely replacing the plant with one that runs
on electricity, would be to install carbon capture equipment. But Reid
said the amount of carbon the plant produces will be so small that it
may not justify the expense. “We continue to talk to players in the
industry and evaluate what they’re bringing out commercially to see if
there’s a match with our production units,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Construction on the plant will begin in a few months, Reid told me, and
won’t take long. BayoTech expects to be delivering hydrogen in 2025.

<h2 id="apple-releases-iosipados-18-macos-15-and-a-ton-more">Apple
releases iOS/iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and a ton more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s Apple operating system release day, so if you’re in the Apple
ecosystem, it’s like Christmas morning, but for your devices. The two
major platforms are, of course, iOS/iPadOS 18: ‌iOS 18‌ adds new
customization options for the Home Screen, with the option to arrange
apps and widgets with open spaces and add new tints to app icons.
Control Center has been entirely overhauled with support for multiple
pages, third-party controls, and the option to put controls on the Lock
Screen and activate them with the Action Button. ↫ Juli Clover at
MacRumors And macOS 15: ‌macOS Sequoia‌ features iPhone Mirroring, which
allows you to control and monitor your ‌iPhone‌ right from your Mac. You
can use your ‌iPhone‌’s apps and get your ‌iPhone‌’s notifications all while
your ‌iPhone‌ is tucked away and locked. Window tiling has been improved
to make it easier to arrange multiple windows on your Mac’s display, and
there are new keyboard and menu shortcuts for organizing your windows.
In Safari, Highlights will now show you the information you want most
from websites, and there’s a new Viewer mode for watching videos without
distractions. ↫ Juli Clover at MacRumors It doesn’t stop there, though,
as Apple also released watchOS 11, visionOS 2, tvOS 18, and the most
import ant most hotly anticipated out of all of Apple’s platforms,
HomePod Software 18. It’s genuinely kind of staggering how Apple manages
to update all of these various platforms at the same time, each coming
with a ton of new features and bugfixes, and ship them out to consumers
– generally without any major issues or showstoppers. Especially in the
case of iOS and macOS, that’s definitely a major difference with the
Windows and Android worlds, where users are confronted with strict
hardware requirements, lack of update availability altogether, or just
stick with previous versions because the new versions contain tons of
privacy or feature regressions. Do note that Apple’s AI/ML features
announced during WWDC aren’t shipping yet, and that iPhone Mirroring is
not available in the EU because someone told Tim Cook “no” and he threw
a hissy fit.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not
guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate
an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran’s
Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani. </p>
<p>Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to
commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for
hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in
Brooklyn. </p>
<p>The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling
to the United States to recruit people for the plot. </p>
<p>Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal
documents from one target and organize protests in the United States,
prosecutors said. </p>
<p>The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not
conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president,
according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of
anonymity. </p>

Service chief ‘fully committed’ to timely US ballot deliveries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said on Monday he is
“personally fully committed” to ensuring all 2024 presidential election
ballots are delivered in a timely fashion and vowed to respond to
concerns raised by state and local officials.</p>
<p>A group of about three dozen election officials from the National
Association of State Election Directors and other groups on Wednesday
raised serious concerns about USPS’s ability to deliver millions of
ballots for the 2024 presidential election, citing questions “about
processing facility operations, lost or delayed election mail, and
front-line training deficiencies impacting USPS’s ability to deliver
election mail in a timely and accurate manner.”  </p>
<p>DeJoy said in a letter released on Monday that he would hold a call
with state officials to address specific concerns.</p>
<p>The officials said that, despite repeated meetings with USPS election
staff, “we have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate
our concerns.”  </p>
<p>DeJoy said the USPS Office of Inspector General is auditing its
plants and delivery units and will report any election mail issues they
discover “and we will address those issues expeditiously.”</p>
<p>Starting Oct. 1, USPS will deploy ballot monitors and others in
processing, retail and delivery units “to reinforce and amplify our
policies and procedures on the ground”</p>
<p>USPS said on average it is currently delivering mail in 2.7 days but
continues “to recommend as a common-sense measure that voters should
mail their completed ballot before Election Day, and at least one week
prior to their state’s deadline.”</p>
<p>The inspector general has said 46% of votes were cast by mail in the
November 2020 presidential election, compared with 21% in the 2016
election.</p>
<p>USPS said in the 2020 general election, it delivered 99.89% of
ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. Voting by
mail in some states is set to start in the coming weeks.</p>

With COP29 now less than two months away, key players are working hard

six-fold increase</a> in energy storage capacity by 2030 at the summit
in November, according to <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. The Global Green
Energy Storage Pledge will ask more than 190 countries to back the goal,
which would see storage capacity reach 1,500 gigawatts, up from 230 GW
in 2022.

Azerbaijan to prioritize conversations at COP29 about how to go forward
with the phase out, which was agreed at last year’s summit in Dubai. One

use the finance negotiations to “block any meaningful progress on

<li>Study: U.S. to see rise in weather-related supply chain disruptions

finds that the risk of weather-related supply chain disruptions will
rise more in the U.S. than in any other country over the next 15 years.
This is because the country is starting from a pretty low baseline risk,
thanks to the interconnectivity of all the states. “If a heatwave or
period of extreme rainfall hits one part of the U.S., it is easily able
to import goods and services from other areas,” <em><em>CarbonBrief
</em></em><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/us-supply-chains-face-biggest-jump-in-weather-shocks-due-to-climate-change/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_DCgZWuFXDykbfipV2ghK9fAAQixBfMlksBGCtgilghs6Wdnq1FEfasG6KGUbXXMt_CHPe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.
But the risk won’t stay that low forever, and indeed the authors note
that the U.S. “is subject to the strongest relative increases in
consumption risks” through 2040 as weather shocks increase.

<h2 id="chrome-on-the-mac-uses-less-battery-than-safari">Chrome on the
Mac uses less battery than Safari</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s one of the most pervasive common wisdoms shared all over the
web, no matter where you go – it’s one of those things everybody seems
to universally agree on: Chrome will absolutely devastate your battery
life on the Mac, and you should really be using Safari, because Apple’s
special integration magic pixie dust sprinkles ensures Safari sips
instead of gulps electricity. Whether you read random forum posters,
Apple PR spokespeople, or Apple’s own executives on stage during events,
this wisdom is hard to escape. Is it true, though? Well, Matt Birchler
decided to do something entirely revolutionary and entirely unheard of:
a benchmark. Back in the olden days of yore, we would run benchmarks to
test the claims from companies and their PR departments, and Birchler
decided to dust off this old technique and develop a routine to put the
Chrome battery claims to the test. After 3 days of continuous testing on
a freshly installed 14” MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro processor and 16 GB
RAM running the latest stable releases of both browsers, Birchler came
to some interesting conclusions. In my 3-hour tests, Safari consumed
18.67% of my battery each time on average, and Chrome averaged 17.33%
battery drain. That works out to about 9% less battery drain from Chrome
than Safari. Yes, you read that right, I found Chrome was easier on my
battery than Safari. While I did experience some variability in each 3
hour test run, Chrome came out on top in 5 of the 6 direct comparisons.
↫ Matt Birchler His methodology seems quite sound and a good
representation of what most laptop users will use their browser for:
YouTube, social media, a few news websites, and editing a Google Doc, in
a 20 minute loop that was repeated for three hours per test. Multiple of
these three hour tests were then ran to counter variability. I highly
doubt using different websites will radically change the results, but I
obviously am curious to see a similar test ran on Windows and Linux, x86
and ARM, for a more complete picture that goes beyond just the Mac.
Conventional wisdom is sometimes wrong, and I think we have a classic
case of that here. While there may have been a time in the past where
Chrome on the Mac devastated battery life, it seems Chrome and Chromium
engineers have closed the gap, and in some cases even beat Safari. Now,
this doesn’t mean everybody should rush and switch to Chrome, since
there are countless other reasons to use Safari over Chrome other than
supposed battery life advantages. With Apple PR arguing that alternative
browser engines should not be allowed on iOS because Chrome would
devastate iOS’ battery life, tests like these are more important than
ever, and I hope we’re going to see more of them. Tech media always just
seems to copy/paste whatever manufacturers and corporations claim
without so much as a hint of skepticism, and this benchmark highlights
the dangers of doing so, in case you didn’t already know believing
corporations was a terribly idea.</p>

Automation is driving the next wave of commoditization, threatening to

</h4>
<p>
<strong>Part 1</strong>  As we have said before, the software industry
has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a
successful sales model of “pile ’em high, sell ’em cheap.” This has
worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be
commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial
bottleneck.…

<h2 id="shogun-and-hacks-win-top-series-emmy-awards">‘Shogun’ and
‘Hacks’ win top series Emmy Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — “Hacks” won the comedy series at Sunday’s Emmy Awards,
topping “The Bear,” which took home several of the night’s honors.</p>
<p>“Shogun” won the best drama series win, collecting a whopping 18
Emmys for its first season, just one of several historic wins.</p>
<p>Hiroyuki Sanada won best actor in a drama for “Shogun” on Sunday
night at the Emmy Awards, and Anna Sawai won best actress as they became
the first two Japanese actors to win Emmys.</p>
<p>Their wins gave the FX series momentum going into one of the night’s
top awards, where “Shogun” won best drama series.</p>
<p>“The Bear” came back for seconds in a big way at the ceremony four
times including best actor, best supporting actor and best supporting
actress in a comedy, while British upstart “Baby Reindeer” won four of
its own, including best limited series.</p>
<p>The star of FX’s “The Bear” Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a
comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as
best supporting actor.</p>
<p>A surprise came when Liza Colón-Zayas won best supporting actor over
major competition.</p>
<p>“How could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence
of Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett,” Colón-Zayas said as tears welled in
her eyes as she accepted the award on the stage of the Peacock Theater
in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>She is the first Latina to win in the category.</p>
<p>“To all the Latinas who are looking at me,” she said, “keep believing
and vote.”</p>
<p>Netflix’s darkly quirky “Baby Reindeer” won best actor and best
writing for the show’s creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting
actress for Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor.</p>
<p>Accepting the best limited series award, Gadd urged the makers of
television to take chances.</p>
<p>“The only constant across any success in television is good
storytelling,” he said. “Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So
take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in
order to achieve.”</p>
<p>“Baby Reindeer” is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd
describes being sexually abused along with other emotional
struggles.</p>
<p>Accepting that award, he said, “no matter how bad it gets, it always
gets better.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have
been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has.</p>
<p>Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she
took best actress in a limited series for “True Detective: Night
Country.”</p>
<p>The creator of “The Bear” was also a repeat winner. Christopher
Storer took his second straight Emmy for directing, an award handed out
by reunited “Happy Days” co-stars Ron Howard and Henry Winkler.</p>
<p>White said backstage that he was watching in the wings as Colón-Zayas
won and “that was just the greatest.”</p>
<p>He also shouted out two acting wins the show had already scored at
last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmy Awards, when Jamie Lee Curtis won best
guest actress in a comedy for playing his mother, and Jon Bernthal won
best guest actor for playing his big brother.</p>
<p>“The Bear” won six times including most of the top comedy categories
at the strike-delayed Emmys in January.</p>
<p>While the third season of FX’s “The Bear” has already dropped, the
trio won their second Emmys for its second, in which White’s chef Carmen
“Carmy” Berzatto attempts to turn his family’s grungy Chicago sandwich
shop into an elite restaurant. It could still win more Sunday night
including best comedy series.</p>
<p>The father-son hosting duo of Eugene and Dan Levy in their monologue
at the top of the show mocked the very dramatic “The Bear” being in the
comedy category.</p>
<p>“In honor of ‘The Bear’ we will be making no jokes,” Eugene Levy
said, to laughs.</p>
<p>Jean Smart won best actress in a comedy for “Hacks.” She has won for
all three seasons of “Hacks,” and has six Emmys overall.</p>
<p>She beat nominees including Ayo Edebiri, who as co-star of “The Bear”
moved from supporting actress, which she won in January, to lead
actress.</p>
<p>Coming into the show the big story was “Shogun,” which had already
taken the most Emmys for a show in a single season with 14 at the
Creative Arts ceremony.</p>
<p>The FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan can still win
best drama series.</p>
<p>If “Shogun” faces competition for the best drama prize, it could come
for the sixth and final season of “The Crown,” the only show among the
nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the
retired “Succession.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing
Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of
the show.</p>
<p>“Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human
being, has been my great privilege,” Debicki said. “It’s been a
gift.”</p>
<p>Billy Crudup won best actor in a drama for “The Morning Show.”</p>
<p>Streep wasn’t the only Oscar winner trumped by a little-known name.
Robert Downey Jr., the reigning best supporting actor winner for
“Oppenheimer,” was considered the favorite to win best supporting actor
in a limited series for “The Sympathizer,” but that award went to
Lamorne Morris for “Fargo.”</p>
<p>“Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house!” Morris said
from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy.</p>
<p>Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history,
including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler
Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi
Watson.</p>

“The Bear.”</p>

town in Kansas finds itself at the center of abortion debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURG, Kan. — The Rev. Anthony Navaratnam stood before his
congregation and urged them to pray for the women from surrounding
states who will flock to the new abortion clinic in town that opened in
August.</p>
<p>“God is giving us an opportunity to be missionaries in Pittsburg,
Kansas,” he told those at Flag Church, which hosted a training on how to
protest outside of the clinic.</p>
<p>The debate over reproductive rights has landed in this college town
of 20,000 in the southeast corner of one of the few states left in the
region still allowing abortions. It is near Missouri, Oklahoma and
Arkansas and not terribly far from Texas.</p>
<p>A place this size, especially one in a historically red state, was
unlikely to have an abortion clinic before Roe v. Wade was overturned in
2022. Since then, Kansas has become one of five states that people are
most likely to travel to in order to get an abortion when they’re unable
to at home, said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury
College who researches abortion policies.</p>
<p>Abortions spiked in Kansas by 152% after Roe, according to a recent
analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.
Using Myers’ count, six of the clinics in Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico,
North Carolina and Virginia that have opened or relocated post-Roe are
in communities with fewer than 25,000 people. Two others are in
communities of fewer than 50,000.</p>
<p>“Kansas is really the only one in this region that can provide care
to many people in these surrounding states,” said Kensey Wright, a
member of the board of directors for the Roe Fund in Oklahoma, which
supports Kansas abortion clinics through grants.</p>
<p>“Without abortion clinics in that state, we would be without hope,”
Wright said.</p>
<p>Providing abortions for out-of-state people</p>
<p>Housed in a former urology office, Pittsburg’s Planned Parenthood
clinic sits across the street from a medical clinic run by a Catholic
health care system. Behind the clinic are houses.</p>
<p>Clinic manager Logan Rink said her mother used to work in this
building as a nurse — a connection that’s “small-town stuff.” She loves
this town, and said her neighbors agree the clinic is needed. But she
was guarded in her optimism, saying ” the reception that we are going to
get from the community is going to be favorable in some ways and
probably not always.”</p>
<p>Experts said smaller-sized clinics can be less overwhelming for women
who are coming from rural areas, like those surrounding Pittsburg. But
there is no anonymity in these smaller communities, where religious and
family ties often run deep. Pittsburg was established in 1876, and
settled largely by immigrants from Catholic-leaning countries who came
to work at surrounding coal mines. There’s a typical main street and a
state university with about 7,400 students.</p>
<p>“In a small town, it’s not just that you’ll know that person. Your
family will know them. You will have known them for 40 years,” said
Dr. Emily Walters, a supporter of the Pittsburg clinic who works as an
anesthesiologist at a hospital in neighboring Missouri. “Your stories
will be intertwined.”</p>
<p>She wondered aloud, “How do I see you at a protest and then see you
the next day at the grocery store and still be able to be polite and
civil with each other?”</p>
<p>Walters also chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party in an area
that is increasingly Republican and has no Democratic state legislators
— a change from 20 years ago when there were six. The county also has
become increasingly religious in the same span; it now has twice as many
white evangelical Protestants as the national average, and slightly more
Catholics, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.</p>
<p>Just five weeks after Roe was overturned in 2022, voters in Kansas
had to decide whether to strip the right to an abortion from the state
constitution, which could have led to an outright ban. Despite the
Republican and religious leanings, 55% of Crawford County voters were
part of the 59% of voters statewide who killed the proposal.</p>
<p>It’s in line with an Associated Press-NORC poll from 2024 that showed
6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to
obtain a legal abortion if they don’t want to be pregnant for any
reason. But the rural counties that surrounded Pittsburg chose otherwise
at the ballot box.</p>
<p>“I remember people were stealing yard signs, putting up different
ones in people’s yards,” said Anastin Journot, an 18-year-old from
Independence, Kansas, who is majoring in elementary education at
Pittsburg State. She said she was alarmed by Roe getting overturned,
remembering she thought: “What if I’m in a situation where I’m needing
to get an abortion and it’s not an option?”</p>
<p>Abortion in Kansas is generally legal up until the 22nd week of
pregnancy. The clinic’s southern location puts it closer to states that
have banned abortions instead of sending people to Kansas’ larger
cities, where hours have been expanded and appointments are still in
short supply.</p>
<p>About 60% to 65% of people who call Planned Parenthood clinics in
Kansas for an abortion appointment are turned away because there isn’t
enough capacity, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned
Parenthood Great Plains. Already, Wales said, the bulk of people seeking
abortions in Kansas are from out of state — mostly Texas, which is about
five hours south. After that, it’s Missouri, a few minutes’ drive east
and Oklahoma, less than an hour away. She said some come from as far
away as Louisiana and even Florida, which now prohibits the procedure
after six weeks.</p>
<p>Clinics “strategically placed near (a state’s) border can really help
ease the congestion,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at
the University of California San Francisco who studies abortion.</p>
<p>Most of the area that’s 100 miles from the new clinic has been
designated as medically underserved for primary care by the federal
government, and the number of obstetricians and gynecologists for every
100,000 female residents is less than half of the U.S. average.</p>
<p>For now, though, the focus at the Pittsburg clinic will be on
abortion. Wales said Planned Parenthood wants to slowly add more
services over the next two to three months, and one future goal for the
clinic is to provide gender-affirming care. Neighboring states have
restricted that, too.</p>
<p>“Pittsburg is going to lift up a whole lot of states in the South and
help people get care,” Wales said.</p>
<p>But those additions, she added, will come after staff gets used to
the patients and the presence of protesters and opposition.</p>
<p>Protesters are at the ready</p>
<p>Donations are up at Vie Medical Clinic, the town’s crisis pregnancy
center, executive director Megan Newman said. Such centers are typically
religiously affiliated and encourage clients to continue their
pregnancies.</p>
<p>People opposed to the Planned Parenthood clinic also are picking up
pamphlets about Vie so they can hand them out to those seeking
abortions. “When we got word that Planned Parenthood was coming, you
could just kind of feel that in the town,” Newman said.</p>
<p>Jeanne Napier, a 68-year-old who attends a local Baptist church,
vowed as she shopped at the local mall that she’ll “be there every day
with signs.”</p>
<p>Her daughter, Terri Napier, said in a phone interview she believes
part of her parents’ opposition to the clinic is from watching her
struggle about 20 years ago. She was in an abusive relationship with
someone who has since died. She got pregnant. The family was fearful of
bringing a child into the situation.</p>
<p>She had an abortion and spiraled into drug use. “I was at war with
forgiving myself,” said the 43-year-old, who is now clean.</p>
<p>Jeanne Napier said she felt like she encouraged the abortion. “And I
hate that,” she said, “because I wish I could take that sin upon myself,
so it’s real personal. I had an active play in terminating a life, and
we don’t have that right.”</p>
<p>Brianna Barnes, a 19-year-old journalism major at Pittsburg State who
is from Wichita, has protested and prayed outside of a clinic in her
hometown.</p>
<p>“If someone made eye contact with us, we just smiled at them, kind of
showing that love and care because no one responds well to screaming,
yelling, violence no matter what side it’s on,” she said just after
arriving on campus for the fall semester. Most of the students the AP
talked to voiced support for the clinic.</p>
<p>Her mother, Crystal Barnes, 42, turned to her daughter: “You’re going
to be the odd man out being a Catholic, and conservative, especially
with things like abortion. It is so heated.”</p>
<p>The Friday before the clinic opened, crews installed a wooden facade
outside, the air filled with the smell of fresh-cut lumber. Walters, the
local anesthesiologist, had stopped by to check on the progress.</p>
<p>Walters’ support comes from a personal place. When she was 20 and the
same number of weeks pregnant, she went to an emergency room, bleeding.
She said she was sent home to miscarry instead of having her labor
induced or having a procedure to remove the fetus.</p>
<p>That experience — “horrific, and wouldn’t be considered standard of
care, in modern practice,” she said — left her with a deep empathy for
women in tough positions.</p>
<p>Just before the 2022 vote, an ad backed by 400 Kansas doctors who
support abortion rights ran in some of the state’s largest papers,
including The Kansas City Star. Walters’ name was listed first. During
that time, her home address appeared online, a frightening prospect in a
state where abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was shot dead in 2009 at
his Wichita church by an anti-abortion extremist.</p>
<p>“It is critical health care for women,” she said. “It is going to be
disruptive to Pittsburg. And that part hurts my heart.”</p>

id="which-candidate-is-better-for-tech-innovation-venture-capitalists-divided-on-harris-or-trump">Which
candidate is better for tech innovation? Venture capitalists divided on
Harris or Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Being a venture capitalist carries a lot of prestige in
Silicon Valley. Those who choose which startups to fund see themselves
as fostering the next big waves of technology.</p>
<p>So when some of the industry’s biggest names endorsed former
President Donald Trump and the onetime venture capitalist he picked for
a running mate, JD Vance, people took notice.</p>
<p>Then hundreds of other venture capitalists — some high profile,
others lesser-known — threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala
Harris, drawing battle lines over which presidential candidate will be
better for tech innovation and the conditions startups need to
thrive.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist and Harris backer Stephen DeBerry says some of his
best friends support Trump. Though centered in a part of Northern
California known for liberal politics, the investors who help finance
the tech industry have long been a more politically divided bunch.</p>
<p>“We ski together. Our families are together. We’re super tight,” said
DeBerry, who runs the Bronze Venture Fund. “This is not about not being
able to talk to each other. I love these guys — they’re almost all guys.
They’re dear friends. We just have a difference of perspective on policy
issues.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the more than 700 venture capitalists who’ve
voiced support for a movement called “VCs for Kamala” will match the
pledges of Trump’s well-heeled supporters such as Elon Musk and Peter
Thiel.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of practical reasons for VCs to support Trump,”
including policies that could drive corporate profits and stock market
values and favor wealthy benefactors, said David Cowan, an investor at
Bessemer Venture Partners. But Cowan said he is supporting Harris as a
VC with a “long-term investment horizon” because a “Trump world reeling
from rampant income inequality, raging wars and global warming is not an
attractive environment” for funding healthy businesses.</p>
<p>Several prominent VCs have voiced their support for Trump on Musk’s
social platform X. Public records show some of them have donated to a
new, pro-Trump super PAC called America PAC, whose donors include
powerful tech industry conservatives with ties to SpaceX and Paypal and
who run in Musk’s social circle. Also driving support is Trump’s embrace
of cryptocurrency and promise to end an enforcement crackdown on the
industry.</p>
<p>Although some Biden policies have alienated parts of the investment
sector concerned about tax policy, antitrust scrutiny or overregulation,
Harris’ bid for the presidency has reenergized interest from VCs who
until recently sat on the sidelines.</p>
<p>“We buy risk, right? And we’re trying to buy the right type of risk,”
Leslie Feinzaig, founder of “VCs for Kamala” said in an interview. “It’s
really hard for these companies that are trying to build products and
scale to do so in an unpredictable institutional environment.”</p>
<p>The schism in tech has left some firms split in their allegiances.
Although venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, founders
of the firm that is their namesake, endorsed Trump, one of their firm’s
general partners, John O’Farrell, pledged his support for Harris.
O’Farrell declined further comment.</p>
<p>Doug Leone, the former managing partner of Sequoia Capital, endorsed
Trump in June, expressing concern on X “about the general direction of
our country, the state of our broken immigration system, the ballooning
deficit, and the foreign policy missteps, among other issues.” But
Leone’s longtime business partner at Sequoia, Michael Moritz, wrote in
the Financial Times that tech leaders supporting Trump “are making a big
mistake.”</p>
<p>Much of the VC discourse about elections is in response to a July
podcast and manifesto in which Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump and
outlined their vision of a “Little Tech Agenda” that they said
contrasted with the policies sought by Big Tech.</p>
<p>They accused the U.S. government of increasing hostility toward
startups and the VCs who fund them, citing Biden’s proposed higher taxes
on the wealthy and corporations and regulations they said could hobble
emerging industries involving blockchain and artificial
intelligence.</p>
<p>Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio who spent time in San Francisco
working at Thiel’s investment firm, voiced a similar perspective about
“little tech” more than a month before he was chosen as Trump’s running
mate.</p>
<p>“The donors who were really involved in Silicon Valley in a pro-Trump
way, they’re not big tech, right? They’re little tech. They’re starting
innovative companies. They don’t want the government to destroy their
ability to innovate,” Vance said in an interview on Fox News in
June.</p>
<p>Complicating the allegiances is that a tough approach to breaking up
the monopoly power of big corporations no longer falls along partisan
lines. Vance has spoken favorably of Lina Khan, who Biden picked to lead
the Federal Trade Commission and has taken on several tech giants.
Meanwhile, some of the most influential VCs backing Harris — such as
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod
Khosla, an early investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — have sharply
criticized Khan’s approach.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose California district encompasses
part of Silicon Valley, said Trump supporters are a vocal minority
reflecting a “third or less” of the region’s tech community. But while
the White House has appealed to tech entrepreneurs with its investments
in clean energy, electric vehicles and semiconductors, Khanna said
Democrats must do a better job of showing that they understand the
appeal of digital assets.</p>
<p>Naseem Sayani, a general partner at Emmeline Ventures, said
Andreessen and Horowitz’s support of Trump became a lightning rod for
those in tech who do not back the Republican nominee. Sayani signed onto
“VCs for Kamala,” she said, because she wanted the types of businesses
that she helps fund to know that the investor community is not
monolithic.</p>
<p>“We’re not single-profile founders anymore,” she said. “There’s
women, there’s people of color, there’s all the intersections. How can
they feel comfortable building businesses when the environment they’re
in doesn’t actually support their existence in some ways?”</p>

unharmed after second assassination attempt, authorities say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Former U.S. President Donald Trump thanked the Secret
Service and local police late Sunday, after what the FBI said was an
apparent assassination attempt at his golf club in West Palm Beach,
Florida.</p>
<p>“I would like to thank everyone for your concerns and well wishes –
It was certainly an interesting day!” Trump said on his Truth Social
service. “The job was done outstanding.”</p>
<p>The incident, in which Trump was not hurt, came two months after he
was shot in the ear during a campaign event in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Members of Trump’s security detail were securing areas of the golf
course ahead of where Trump was playing Sunday when they spotted a
gunman in the bushes. Secret Service agents fired at the suspect, who
fled the area and was later arrested.</p>
<p>The local sheriff said the suspect left behind an “AK-47-style rifle”
with a scope, a GoPro camera and two backpacks.</p>
<p>“The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic
job,” said Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s
Office, in a briefing held by law enforcement shortly after. “What they
do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the
president was at. And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out
of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the
individual took off.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said in a Sunday evening statement that he
was relieved Trump was unharmed.</p>
<p>“As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence
or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to
continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability
and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s
continued safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump in the
November presidential election, said she was “deeply disturbed by the
possible assassination attempt of former President Trump.”</p>
<p>“As President Biden said, our Administration will ensure the Secret
Service has every resource, capability, and protective measure necessary
to carry out its critical mission,” Harris said in a statement.</p>
<p>Various national media sources, including The Associated Press, The
New York Times and Fox News Channel, cited unnamed law enforcement
officials who identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of
Hawaii. Those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>Social media posts show Routh backing Trump’s 2020 election campaign,
but more recent posts expressing support for Biden and Harris.</p>
<p>Routh also repeatedly discussed the war in Ukraine and appeared to
try to recruit soldiers to aid in Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Trump has not announced any changes to his schedule and is set to
speak live on X on Monday night from his Mar-a-Lago resort to launch his
sons’ crypto platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leaders of a congressional bipartisan task force
investigating the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump said they have
requested a briefing by the Secret Service.</p>

Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-reviving-newgvn">GSoC 2024: Reviving NewGVN</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-16, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
This summer I participated in GSoC under the LLVM Compiler
Infrastructure. The goal of the project was to improve the NewGVN pass
so that it can replace GVN as the main value numbering pass in LLVM.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
Global Value Numbering (GVN) consists of assigning value numbers such
that instructions with the same value number are equivalent. NewGVN was
introduced in 2016 to replace GVN. We now highlight a few aspects in
which NewGVN is better than GVN.
</p>
<p>
A key advantage of NewGVN over GVN is that it is complete for loops,
while GVN is only complete for acyclical code. NewGVN is complete for
loops because when it first processes loops, it assumes that only the
first iteration will be executed, later corroborating these
assumptions—this is known as the optimistic assumption. In practice, the
optimistic assumption boils down to assuming that backedges are
unreachable and, consequently, that when evaluating phi instructions,
the values carried by them can be ignored. For instance, in the example
below, <code>%a</code> is optimistically evaluated to <code>0</code>.
This leads to evaluating <code>%c</code> to <code>%x</code>, which in
turn leads to evaluating <code>%a.i</code> to <code>0</code>. At this
point, there are two possibilities: either the assumption was correct
and the loop actually only executes once, and the value numbers computed
so far are correct, or the instructions in the loop need to be
reevaluated. Assume, for this example, that NewGVN could not prove that
only one iteration is executed. Then <code>%a</code> once again
evaluates to <code>0</code>, and all other registers also evaluate to
the same. Thanks to the optimistic assumption, we were able to discover
that <code>%a</code> is loop-invariant and, moreover, that it is equal
to <code>0</code>.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm"><span style="color:#66d9ef">define</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> @optimistic(<span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %x, <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %y){entry: <span style="color:#66d9ef">br</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">label</span> %looploop: %a = <span style="color:#66d9ef">phi</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, %entry], [%a.i, %loop] ... %c = <span style="color:#66d9ef">xor</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %x, %a %a.i = <span style="color:#66d9ef">sub</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %x, %c <span style="color:#66d9ef">br</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i1</span> ..., <span style="color:#66d9ef">label</span> %loop,<span style="color:#66d9ef">label</span> %exitexit: <span style="color:#66d9ef">ret</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %a}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
On the other hand, GVN fails to detect this equivalence because it would
pessimistically evaluate <code>%a</code> to itself, and the previously
described evaluation steps would never take place.
</p>
<p>
Another advantage of NewGVN is the value numbering of memory operations
using
<a href="https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/docs/MemorySSA.html">MemorySSA</a>.
It provides a functional view of memory where instructions that can
modify memory produce a new memory version, which is then used by other
memory operations. This greatly simplifies the detection of redundancies
among memory operations. For example, two loads of the same type from
equivalent pointers and memory versions are trivially equivalent.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm"><span style="color:#66d9ef">define</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> @foo(<span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %v, <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">ptr</span> %p) {entry:<span style="color:#75715e">; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry)</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">store</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %v, <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">ptr</span> %p, <span style="color:#66d9ef">align</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span><span style="color:#75715e">; MemoryUse(1)</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> %a = <span style="color:#66d9ef">load</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span>, <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">ptr</span> %p, <span style="color:#66d9ef">align</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span><span style="color:#75715e">; MemoryUse(1)</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> %b = <span style="color:#66d9ef">load</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span>, <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">ptr</span> %p, <span style="color:#66d9ef">align</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span><span style="color:#75715e">; 2 = MemoryDef(1)</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">call</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> @f(<span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %a)<span style="color:#75715e">; MemoryUse(2)</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> %c = <span style="color:#66d9ef">load</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span>, <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">ptr</span> %p, <span style="color:#66d9ef">align</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> %d = <span style="color:#66d9ef">sub</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %b, %c <span style="color:#66d9ef">ret</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">i32</span> %d}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
In the example above (annotated with MemorySSA), <code>%a</code> and
<code>%b</code> are equivalent, while <code>%c</code> is not. All three
loads are of the same type from the same pointer, but they don’t all
load from the same memory state. Loads <code>%a</code> and
<code>%b</code> load from the memory defined by the store (Memory
<code>1</code>), while <code>%c</code> loads from the memory defined by
the function call (Memory <code>2</code>). GVN can also detect these
redundancies, but it relies on the more expensive and less general
MemoryDependenceAnalysis.
</p>
<p>
Despite these and other improvements NewGVN is still not widely used,
mainly because it lacks partial redundancy elimination (PRE) and because
it is bug-ridden.
</p>
<h1 id="implementing-pre">
Implementing PRE
</h1>
<p>
Our main contribution was the development of a PRE stage for NewGVN
(<a href="https://github.com/ManuelJBrito/llvm-project/tree/Benchmarks">found
here</a>). Our solution relied on generalizing Phi-of-Ops. It performs a
special case of PRE where the instruction depends on a phi instruction,
and an equivalent value is available on every reaching path. This is
achieved in two steps: phi-translation and phi-insertion.
</p>
<p>
Phi-translation consists of evaluating the original instruction in the
context of each of its block’s predecessors. Phi operands are replaced
by the value incoming from the predecessor. The value is available in
the predecessor if the translated instruction is equivalent to a
constant, function argument, or another instruction that dominates the
predecessor.
</p>
<p>
Phi-insertion occurs after phi-translation if the value is available in
every predecessor. At that point, a phi of the equivalent values is
constructed and used to replace the original instruction. The full
process is illustrated in the following example.

</div>
<p>
Our generalization eliminated the need for a dependent phi and
introduced the ability to insert the missing values in cases where the
instruction is partially redundant. To prevent increases in code size
(ignoring the inserted phi instructions), the insertion is only made if
it’s the only one required. The full process is illustrated in the
following example.

<p>
Integrating PRE into the existing framework also allowed us to gain
loop-invariant code motion (LICM) for free. The optimistic assumption,
combined with PRE, allows NewGVN to speculatively hoist instructions out
of loops. On the other hand, LICM in GVN relies on using LoopInfo and
can only handle very specific cases.

<h1 id="missing-features">
Missing Features
</h1>
<p>
The two main features our PRE implementation lacks are critical edge
splitting and load coercion. Critical edge splitting is required to
ensure that we do not insert instructions into paths where they won’t be
used. Currently, our implementation simply bails in such cases. Load
coercion allows us to detect equivalences of loaded values with
different types, such as loads of <code>i32</code> and
<code>float</code>, and then coerce the loaded type using conversion
operations.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty in implementing these features is that NewGVN is designed
to perform analysis and transformation in separate steps, while these
features involve modifying the function during the analysis phase.

Results
</h1>
<p>
We evaluated our implementation using the automated benchmarking tool
<a href="https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix Test Suite</a>
from which we selected a set of 20 C/C++ applications (listed below).

<p>
The default <code>-O2</code> pipeline was used. The only change betweeen
compilations was the value numbering pass used.
</p>
<p>
Despite the missing features, we observed that our implementation, on
average, performs 0.4% better than GVN. However, it is important to
mention that our solution hasn’t been fine-tuned to consider the rest of
the optimization pipeline, which resulted in some cases where our
implementation regressed compared to both GVN and the existing NewGVN.
The most severe case was with jpegxl, where our implementation, on
average, performed 10% worse than GVN. It’s important to note that this
was an outlier; excluding jpegxl, most regressions were at most 2%.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to study these
cases in more detail.

<h1 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h1>
<p>
In the future, we plan to implement the aforementioned missing features
and fine-tune the heuristics for when to perform PRE to prevent the
regressions discussed in the results section. Once these issues are
addressed, we’ll upstream our implementation, bringing us a step closer
to reviving NewGVN.
