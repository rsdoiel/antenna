## /tmp should not exist

date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News

I commented on Lobsters that&#160;/tmp&#160;is usually a bad idea, which caused some surprise. I suppose&#160;/tmp&#160;security bugs were common in the 1990s when I was learning Unix, but they are pretty rare now so I can see why less grizzled hackers might not be familiar with the problems. I guess that’s some kind of success, but sadly the fixes have left behind a lot of scar tissue because they didn’t address the underlying problem:&#160;/tmp&#160;should not exist. ↫ Tony Finch Not only is this an excellent, cohesive, and convincing argument against the existence of /tmp, it also contains some nice historical context as to why things are the way they are. Even without the arguments against /tmp, though, it just seems entirely more logical, cleaner, and sensible to have /tmp directories per user in per user locations. While I never would&#8217;ve been able to so eloquently explain the problem as Finch does, it just feels wrong to have every user resort to the exact same directory for temporary files, like a complex confluence of bad decisions you just know is going to cause problems, even if you don&#8217;t quite understand the intricate interplay.

## Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound

date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News

Apple announced a trio of major new hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 in September, including clinical-grade hearing aid functionality, a hearing test, and more robust hearing protection. All three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and they could mark a watershed moment for hearing health awareness. Apple is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an over-the-counter hearing aid. ↫ Chris Welch at The Verge Rightfully so, most of us here have a lot of issues with the major technology companies and the way they do business, but every now and then, even they accidentally stumble into doing something good for the world. AirPods are already a success story, and gaining access to hearing aid-level features at their price point is an absolute game changer for a lot of people with hearing issues &#8211; and for a lot of people who don&#8217;t even yet know they have hearing issues in the first place. If you have people in your life with hearing issues, or whom you suspect may have hearing issues, gifting them AirPods this Christmas season may just be a perfect gift. Yes, I too think hearing aids should be a thing nobody has to pay for and which should just be part of your country&#8217;s universal healthcare coverage &#8211; assuming you have such a thing &#8211; but this is not a bad option as a replacement.

## System76 unveils ARM Ampere Altra workstation

date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News

System76, purveyor of Linux computers, distributions, and now also desktop environments, has just unveiled its latest top-end workstation, but this time, it&#8217;s not an x86 machine. They&#8217;ve been working together with Ampere to build a workstation based around Ampere&#8217;s Altra ARM processors: the Thelio Astra. Phoronix, fine purveyor of Linux-focused benchmarks, were lucky enough to benchmark one, and has more information on the new workstation. System76 designed the Thelio Astra in collaboration with Ampere Computing. The System76 Thelio Astra makes use of Ampere Altra processors up to the Ampere Altra Max 128-core ARMv8 processor that in turn supports 8-channel DDR4 ECC memory. The Thelio Astra can be configured with up to 512GB of system memory, choice of Ampere Altra processors, up to NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation graphics, dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and up to 16TB of PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage. System76 designed the Thelio Astra ARM64 workstation to be complemented by NVIDIA graphics given the pervasiveness of NVIDIA GPUs/accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The Astra is contained within System76&#8217;s custom-designed, in-house-manufactured Thelio chassis. Pricing on the System76 Thelio Astra will start out at $3,299 USD with the 64-core Ampere Altra Q64-22 processor, 2 x 32GB of ECC DDR4-3200 memory, 500GB NVMe SSD, and NVIDIA A402 graphics card. ↫ Michael Larabel This pricing is actually remarkably favourable considering the hardware you&#8217;re getting. System76 and its employees have been dropping hints for a while now they were working on an ARM variant of their Thelio workstation, and knowing some of the prices others are asking, I definitely expected the base price to hit $5000, so this is a pleasant surprise. With the Altra processors getting a tiny bit long in the tooth, you do notice some oddities here, specifically the DDR4 RAM instead of the modern DDR5, as well as the lack of PCIe 5.0. The problem is that while the Altra has a successor in the AmpereOne processor, its availability is quite limited, and most of them probably end up in datacentres and expensive servers for big tech companies. This newer variant does come with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, but doesn&#8217;t yet have a lower core count version, so even if it were readily available it might simply push the price too far up. Regardless, the Altra is still a ridiculously powerful processor, and at anywhere between 64 and 128 cores, it&#8217;s got power to spare. The Thelio Astra will be available come 12 November, and while I would perform a considerable number of eyebrow-raising acts to get my hands on one, it&#8217;s unlikely System76 will ship one over for a review.

## Eyeballs

I recently got contact lenses, for the first time in 34 years, as someone who has required corrective eyewear since the age of 6.
I have attributed the decision mostly to my ongoing midlife/existential crisis — as a way to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m NOT set in my ways and I CAN do new things — and for whatever reason I had increasingly been thinking that my eyeglasses are my whole personality and I was interested in experimenting with a different look.

## Microsoft maintains its own Windows debloat scripts on GitHub

date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News

It&#8217;s no secret that a default Windows installation is&#8230; Hefty. In more ways than one, Windows is a bit on the obese side of the spectrum, from taking up a lot of disk space, to requiring hefty system requirements (artificial or not), to coming with a lot of stuff preinstalled not everyone wants to have to deal with. As such, there&#8217;s a huge cottage industry of applications, scripts, modified installers, custom ISOs, and more, that try to slim Windows down to a more manageable size. As it turns out, even Microsoft itself wants in on this action. The company that develops and sells Windows also provides a Windows debloat script. Over on GitHub, Microsoft maintains a repository of scripts simplify setting up Windows as a development environment, and amid the collection of scripts we find RemoveDefaultApps.ps1, a PowerShell script to &#8220;Uninstall unnecessary applications that come with Windows out of the box&#8221;. The script is about two years old, and as such it includes a few applications no longer part of Windows, but looking through the list is a sad reminder of the kind of junk Windows comes with, most notably mobile casino games for children like Bubble Witch and March of Empires, but also other nonsense like the Mixed Reality Portal or Duolingo. It also removes something called &#8220;ActiproSoftwareLLC&#8220;, which are apparently a set of third-party, non-Microsoft UI controls for WPF? Which comes preinstalled with Windows sometimes? What is even happening over there? The entire set of scripts makes use of Chocolatey wrapped in Boxstarter, which is &#8220;a wrapper for Chocolatey and includes features like managing reboots for you&#8221;, because of course, the people at Microsoft working on Windows can&#8217;t be bothered to fix application management and required reboots themselves. Silly me, expecting Microsoft&#8217;s Windows developers to address these shortcomings internally instead of using third-party tools. The repository seems to be mostly defunct, but the fact it even exists in the first place is such a damning indictment of the state of Windows. People keep telling us Windows is fine, but if even Microsoft itself needs to resort to scripts and third-party tools to make it usable, I find it hard to take claims of Windows being fine seriously in any way, shape, or form.

## Booting Sun SPARC servers

date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News

In early 2022 I got several Sun SPARC servers for free off of a FreeCycle ad: I was recently called out for not providing any sort of update on those devices… so here we go! ↫ Sidneys1.com Some information on booting old-style SPARC machines, as well as pretty pictures. Nice palate-cleanser if you&#8217;ve had to deal with something unpleasant this weekend. This world would be a better place if we all had our own Sun machines to play with when we get sad.

## GSoC 2024: The 1001 thresholds in LLVM

date: 2024-10-21, from: LLVM Blog

<p>Hey everyone! My name is Shourya and I worked on LLVM this summer through GSoC. My project is called <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/MnheN07A">The 1001 thresholds in LLVM</a>. The main objective of this project was to study how varying different thresholds in llvm affect performance parameters like compile-time, bitcode-size, execution-time and llvm stats.</p><h1 id="background">Background</h1><p>LLVM has lots of thresholds and flags to avoid &ldquo;costly cases&rdquo;. However, it is unclear if these thresholds are useful, their value is reasonable, and what impact they really have. Since there are a lot, one cannot do a simple exhaustive search. An example of work in this direction includes the introduction of a C++ class that can replace hardcoded values which offers control over the threshold, e.g., one can increase the recursion limit via a command line flag from the hardcoded &ldquo;6&rdquo; to a different number. As such there is a need to explore different thresholds in llvm, understand what it means for a threshold to be hit, profile different thresholds and select optimal values for different thresholds.</p><h1 id="what-we-did">What We Did</h1><p>This work provides a tool that can efficiently explore these knobs and understand how modifying them affects metrics like compile time, size of the generated program, or any statistic that LLVM emits like “Number of loops vectorized”. (Note that execution-time is currently not evaluated because input-gen does not work on optimized IR and is thus part of future work.)</p><p>We first built a clang matcher for which we looked for the following patterns :</p><ol><li>Const knob_name = knob_val</li><li>Cl::init</li><li>Enum {knob_name = knob_val}</li></ol><p>to first identify the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J8G06FVoI6dyoz36_zCz1Z1udcLLg5If5gdSpcII-S8/edit?usp=sharing">knobs</a> in the codebase and then used a custom python tool (optimised to deal with I/O and cache bottlenecks) to collect the different stat values in parallel and stored them in a json file. After manual selection of interesting knobs, we have so far conducted three studies in which we measure compile-time and bitcode-size along with various other statistics, and present them in the form of interactive graphs. Two of them (on 10,000 and 100 bitcode files) look at average statistics for each knob value while the third one (on 10,000 bitcode files) studies how each file is affected individually by changing knob values. We see some very interesting patterns in these graphs, for instance in the following two graphs, representing the jump-threading-threshold, we can observe improved statistics (top graph) and decreased average compile time (bottom graph) if the knob value is increased.</p><div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;"> <img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/the-1001-thresholds-in-llvm-2024-08-31-figure1.png"><br /></div><div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;"> <img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/the-1001-thresholds-in-llvm-2024-08-31-figure2.png"><br /></div><h1 id="results">Results</h1><p>The per file study proves that there is no one single magic knob value and the optimum, with regards to compile time or code size, depends on the file that is currently being compiled. For instance here we can see that different knob values (for the knob licm-mssa-optimization-cap) give good cumulative compile time improvements for different files. In detail, most files benefit from a knob value of 300 while 60 is the best knob value for the second most files.</p><div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;"> <img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/the-1001-thresholds-in-llvm-2024-08-31-figure3.png"><br /></div><p>We further show that the presence of an oracle that can tell the best knob value for each file can significantly improve the cumulative compile time.</p><div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;"> <img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/the-1001-thresholds-in-llvm-2024-08-31-figure4.png"><br /></div><p>In this project, we explored various thresholds in LLVM—specifically, 93 thresholds (a 100 file study for each can be found <a href="https://sh0g0-1758.github.io/GSOC-X-LLVM/100.html">here</a>) using the Clang matcher—and observed that these thresholds are largely file-specific. This indicates that there is no universally optimal value, or even a set of values, that can be applied across different scenarios. Instead, what is needed is an adaptive mechanism within LLVM, an oracle, that can dynamically determine the appropriate threshold values during compilation.</p><p>We also experimented with varying thresholds cumulatively by leveraging file-specific information through an LLVM pass. However, after discussions with the mentors, this approach was set aside due to the significant changes it would necessitate across other parts of the LLVM codebase.</p><p>As a result, we have not yet categorized different thresholds, such as identifying optimal threshold values for specific file types (e.g., I/O-intensive files). Nonetheless, we provide a tool that can efficiently collect this data (LLVM statistics, bitcode-size and compile-time) and help visualize it with the help of interactive graphs as well as histograms that examine these variations on a per-file basis. Additionally, a correlation table between knob values and performance metrics further illustrates the significant impact this study could have on improving LLVM&rsquo;s overall performance.</p><h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1><p>The early results show that we need a better understanding of knob values to maximise various objectives. Our results will provide the community with the first step in developing a guided compilation model attune to the file that is being compiled. We further intend to show how these knobs interact with each other and whether modifying multiple knobs together compounds the benefits or not. One more area of work could be on <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2024-04/slides/LightningTalks/Ivanov-AutomaticProxyAppGeneration.pdf">input-gen</a> that would enable us to collect and study execution-time in our performance parameters.</p><h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1><p>This project would not have been possible without my amazing mentors, Jan Hückelheim, Johannes Doerfert, the LLVM Foundation admins, and the GSoC admins.</p><h1 id="links">Links</h1><p><a href="https://github.com/Sh0g0-1758/GSOC-X-LLVM/tree/oracle">Code</a></p><p><a href="https://sh0g0-1758.github.io/GSOC-X-LLVM/">Studies</a></p><p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/MnheN07A">GSoC Project Page</a></p>
