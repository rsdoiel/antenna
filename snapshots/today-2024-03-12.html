Hossenfelder</a> does the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true">good
Dr. Pangloss</a> proud in her report on
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y"><i>A 3D nanoscale
optical disk memory with petabit capacity</i></a> by Miao Zhao <i>et
al</i>. Their abstract claims that:<br />
<blockquote>
we increase the capacity of [optical data storage] to the petabit level
by extending the planar recording architecture to three dimensions with
hundreds of layers, meanwhile breaking the optical diffraction limit
barrier of the recorded spots. We develop an optical recording medium
based on a photoresist film doped with aggregation-induced emission dye,
which can be optically stimulated by femtosecond laser beams. This film
is highly transparent and uniform, and the aggregation-induced emission
phenomenon provides the storage mechanism. It can also be inhibited by
another deactivating beam, resulting in a recording spot with a
super-resolution scale. This technology makes it possible to achieve
exabit-level storage by stacking nanoscale disks into arrays, which is
essential in big data centres with limited space.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I discuss this technology.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> What the authors mean by “petabit
level”
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The ODS has a capacity of up to 1.6 Pb for a DVD-sized disk area through
the recording of 100 layers on both sides of our ultrathin single disk.
</blockquote>
1.6 petabit is 200TB per disk, which is 2,000 times the capacity of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray">triple-level Blu-ray
media</a>. So this is a big increase. But weirdly, the caption to their
Figure 1 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">claims
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The capacity of a single 3D nanoscale disk is approximately equivalent
to that of a petabit-level Blu-ray library (15.2 Pb, DA-BH7010, Hualu,
China) or an HDD data array (12.64 Pb, EMC PowerVault ME5084, Dell,
USA).
</blockquote>
A decade ago,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
Blu-ray library</a> put 10,000 100GB disks in a single rack for 1
Peta<i>byte</i> or 8 Peta<i>bit</i> capacity. This is 5 times as much as
the authors’ claim for a single disk. The caption’s claim of 15.2Pb for
the DA-BH7010 is 9.5 times their claim of the capacity of a single disk.
Note also that they compare the volume of a single disk to the volume of
complete read-write systems, which is comparing apples to oranges. I
guess if your meaning of “approximately” is “within an order of
magnitude” that makes sense.<br /> <br />

(second state) with the yellow and pink lines (third state) in Figure 3c
shows that the second and third states are readily distinguishable by
their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">emissions
when illuminated by &gt;1mw 480nm</a>.<br /> <br /> There are a number
of reasons to be less enthusiastic about the potential of this
technology than Hossenfelder. It is true that they have demonstrated the
ability to read and write petabit-scale data on a CD-sized medium. To do
the reading they use two lasers, a 480nm pulsed and a 592nm continuous
laser. To do the writing they used two lasers, a 515nm
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_locking">femtosecond
laser</a> and a 639nm continuous-wave laser. I haven’t been able to find
a price for a 515nm femtosecond laser, but
<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=14348">here</a>
is a 1550nm femtosecond laser for $48,880. The femtosecond laser they
actually
(<a href="https://www.acculasers.com/en/product/fs_lasers/">Acculasers
ACL-AFS-515-CUS</a>) used is a substantial box with fans and an AC power
input.<br /> <br /> The authors make claims of the density of the
<i>medium</i> but not of the <i>system</i>. Clearly, current femtosecond
lasers are too expensive and too large to use in equivalents of the
decade-old
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook
Blu-Ray technology</a>. Something like Microsoft Research’s system that
uses femtosecond lasers to write in Silica allows the cost of the lasers
to be amortized over an entire data-center aisle of media. If you are
going to build something like this, there is no reason to use the CD
form factor.<br /> <br /> The repetition rate of the femtosecond laser
was 42MHz. I believe it writes one bit per pulse, so the write bandwidth
is limited to around 5MB/sec, meaning that writing an entire disk would
take around 10.5 hours. A system using this technology would be
write-once, and have a long read latency while the robot fetched the
needed disk. It would thus only be suitable for the niche archival
market, and in this market the slow write rate would require many drives
writing in parallel. This all makes this claim by the authors
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">somewhat
hyperbolic</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the development of next-generation industry-oriented nanoscale ODS that
is much less expensive than state-of-the-art optical disk libraries and
HDD data arrays will fulfil the vast data storage requirements of the
big-data era.

Six years on flash has finally impacted the bulk storage market, but it
isn’t predicted to ship as many bits as hard disks for another four
years, when it will be a 40-year-old technology. Actual demonstrations
of DNA storage are only 12 years old, and similar demonstrations of
silica media are 15 years old. History suggests it will be decades
before these technologies impact the storage market.<br />

Hossenfelder makes several mistakes in her report:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“new disk memory that could bring disk memory into the Petabyte range” -
no, that is the Peta<i>bit</i> range.
</li>
<li>
Optical disks “were outcompeted by hard disks”. - no, write-once
removable media and on-line storage are two completely different
markets. Optical disks lost out to the cloud and to a lesser extent by
flash.
</li>
<li>
“the information density on compact disks or any optical storage is
ultimately limited by the frequency of the laser light” - well yes, but
she is talking about a paper describing a 2000-times increase in
capacity <i>using laser light</i>.
</li>
<li>
“in modern flash drives the information is stored in little magnetizable
cells that are a few atoms in size” - no, flash isn’t a magnetic
technology. She also misses that modern flash is a volumetric not a
planar technology, just like the technology in the paper.
</li>
<li>
“figured out how to write data in multiple layers” - no, Blu-ray is a
multi-layer technology more than a decade old. They figured out how to
write a lot more layers of much smaller bits.
</li>
<li>
“this could work up to hundreds of layers” - well, they only
demonstrated 100 layers, so hundreds plural is speculation. To get to
the petabyte range needs at least 500 layers or much smaller bits. Note
that modern flash has over 100 layers.
</li>
</ul>

<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
It’s practically accepted as truth at this point: Millennials would be
the first generation to be worse off than their parents. But recent
research casts some doubt on that assessment. We’ll consider some
economic findings that reframe things a bit. Plus, prices were up 3.2%
annually in February, and month-over-month price increases seem to be
going in the wrong direction. That’s not something the Federal Reserve
will be happy about.

Astronauts From Four Countries Return to Earth After Six Months in
Orbit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida — Four astronauts from four countries caught
a lift back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday to end a half-year mission
at the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Their capsule streaked across the U.S. in the predawn darkness and
splashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Panhandle.</p>
<p>NASA’s Jasmin Moghbeli, a Marine helicopter pilot, led the returning
crew of Denmark’s Andreas Mogensen, Japan’s Satoshi Furukawa and
Russia’s Konstantin Borisov.</p>
<p>They moved into the space station last August. Their replacements
arrived last week in their own SpaceX capsule.</p>
<p>“We left you some peanut butter and tortillas,” Moghbeli radioed
after departing the orbiting complex on Monday. Replied NASA’s Loral
O’Hara: “I miss you guys already and thanks for that very generous
gift.”</p>
<p>O’Hara has another few weeks at the space station before leaving
aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.</p>
<p>Before leaving the space station, Mogensen said via X, formerly known
as Twitter, that he couldn’t wait to hear “birds singing in the trees”
and also craved crunchy food.</p>
<p>NASA prefers multiple travel options in case of rocket trouble.
Boeing should start providing astronaut taxi service with a two-pilot
test flight in early May.</p>

<p>Do we have enough fuel to get to our destination? This is probably
one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets
ready to embark on a road trip. If the trip is long, you will need to
visit gas stations along your route to refuel during your travel. NASA
is grappling with similar issues as it gets ready to embark on a
sustainable mission back to the Moon and plans future missions to
Mars.</p>

Inflation Rises in February in Sign Price Pressures Remain Elevated</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Consumer prices in the United States picked up last
month, a sign that inflation remains a persistent challenge for the
Federal Reserve and for President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, both
of which are counting on a steady easing of price pressures this
year. </p>
<p>Prices rose 0.4% from January to February, higher than the previous
month’s figure of 0.3%, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Compared with
a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.2% last month, faster than
January’s 3.1% annual pace. </p>
<p>Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called “core” prices
also climbed 0.4% from January to February, matching the previous
month’s increase and a faster pace than is consistent with the Fed’s 2%
target. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it
typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely
headed. </p>
<p>Pricier gas pushed up overall inflation, with pump prices rising 3.8%
just from January to February. Grocery prices, though, were unchanged
last month and are up just 1% from a year earlier. The cost of clothing,
used cars and rent also increased in February, raising the inflation
figure. </p>
<p>Despite February’s elevated figures, most economists expect inflation
to continue slowly declining this year. At the same time, the uptick
last month may underscore the Fed’s cautious approach toward interest
rate cuts. </p>
<p>Overall inflation has plummeted from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022,
although it’s now easing more slowly than it did last spring and summer.
The prices of some goods — from appliances to furniture to used cars —
are falling after clogged supply chains during the pandemic sent prices
soaring higher. There are more new cars on dealer lots and electronics
on store shelves. </p>
<p>By contrast, prices for dental care, car repairs and other services
are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic. Car insurance
has shot higher, reflecting rising costs for repairs and replacement.
And after having sharply raised pay for nurses and other in-demand
staff, hospitals are passing their higher wage costs on to patients in
the form of higher prices. </p>
<p>Voter perceptions of inflation are sure to occupy a central place in
this year’s presidential election. Despite a healthy job market and a
record-high stock market, polls show that many Americans blame Biden for
the surge in consumer prices that began in 2021. Although inflationary
pressures have significantly eased, average prices remain far above
where they stood three years ago. </p>
<p>In his State of the Union speech last week, Biden highlighted steps
he has taken to reduce costs, like capping the price of insulin for
Medicare patients. The president also criticized many large companies
for engaging in “price gouging” and so-called “shrinkflation,” in which
a company shrinks the amount of product inside a package rather than
raising the price. </p>
<p>“Too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging
more and more for less and less,” Biden said. </p>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in congressional testimony last week
that the central bank is getting closer to cutting rates. After meeting
in January, Fed officials said in a statement that they needed “greater
confidence” that inflation was steadily falling to their 2% target
level. Since then, several of the Fed’s policymakers have said they
believe prices will keep declining. One reason, they suggested, is that
consumers are increasingly pushing back against higher prices by seeking
out cheaper alternatives. </p>
<p>Most economists expect the Fed’s first rate cut to occur in June,
although May is also possible. When the Fed cuts its benchmark rate,
over time it reduces borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, credit
cards and business loans. </p>
<p>One factor that could keep inflation elevated is the still-healthy
economy. Although most economists had expected a recession to occur last
year, hiring and growth were strong and remain healthy. The economy
expanded 2.5% last year and could grow at about the same pace in the
first three months of this year, according to the Federal Reserve’s
Atlanta branch. </p>
<p>Last week, the Labor Department said employers added a robust 275,000
jobs in February, the latest in a streak of solid hiring gains, and the
unemployment rate stayed below 4% for the 25th straight month. That is
the longest such streak since the 1960s. </p>
<p>Still, the unemployment rate rose from 3.7% to 3.9%, and wage growth
slowed. Both trends could make the Fed feel more confident that the
economy is cooling, which could help keep inflation falling and lead the
central bank to begin cutting rates.</p>

<li>Report: BYD struggles to ramp up overseas EV sales</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Chinese EV maker BYD has reportedly hit a speed bump on
the road to international expansion. Having dominated the Chinese market
and established itself as the top-selling EV maker in the world, BYD set
an internal goal of selling 400,000 cars overseas this year. But a
global slowdown in EV sales growth has hampered that effort,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=50a9e2c998&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a><em>
The Wall Street Journal</em>. “As of the end of last year, more than
10,000 BYD passenger cars were waiting in warehouses in Europe,” the
<em>Journal</em> added, “and the certificates authorizing them to be
sold in the European Union are set to expire soon, meaning it may not be
possible to sell them in Europe.” At the same time, quality control
issues have been cropping up in some vehicles, and higher prices in
Europe are making it more difficult for the company to compete with
better-known brands.

<li>U.K. emissions hit 145-year low</li>

<p>
<strong></strong>Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK fell last year to
their lowest level since 1879, according to
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=abaf433330&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>
from <em>Carbon Brief</em>. The decline is attributed mainly to a drop
in gas demand thanks to higher electricity imports and warmer
temperatures. As recently as 2014, the power sector was the UK’s largest
source of emissions, but now it has been eclipsed by transportation,
buildings, industry, and agriculture. “Transport emissions have barely
changed over the past several decades as more efficient cars have been
offset by increased traffic,” <em>Carbon Brief </em>explained.
Remarkably, coal use in the country is at its lowest level since the
1730s, “when George II was on the throne.” The emissions drop is good
news but “with only one coal-fired power station remaining and the power
sector overall now likely only the fifth-largest contributor to UK
emissions, the country will need to start cutting into gas power and
looking to other sectors” to meet net zero by 2050. Meanwhile, the
British government today

<h2 id="ai-and-the-nyt">AI and the NYT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Zach Seward, a friend from my days at
<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/about/">Harvard</a> and NYU, got a
kickass
<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/">job</a>,
starting up the AI effort at the NYT. He’s just the right guy for it.
Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong
startup journalism background. I couldn’t think of anyone I’d want more
to be in this position.
</p>
<p>
Now that he’s published
<a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter">notes</a>
for a talk he gave at SXSW, it’s time to share some of the ideas I have
for the NYT re AI.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn’t do. Not sure why. I’d
like to be able to connect to
<a href="https://ai.nytimes.com/">ai.nytimes.com</a> and ask it to give
me a rundown on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615">lawyer</a> who’s
testifying in Congress today about how our president is “elderly.” I
don’t want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the
response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that
answers the questions I have about this dude. Maybe the AI will factor
out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY">BS</a> the
NYT adds to their stories and just give me the facts without all the
spin.
</li>
<li>
More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the
<a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library">big
library</a> in Jamaica (Queens) going back through microfilm of the NYT
from before I was born. So far all we’ve done is replicate the microfilm
user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that
ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source
material, used to answer very specific questions.
</li>
<li>
Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their
blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians,
journalists and others to study in the future. At some point the NYT and
other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and
intelligence of the readers, why not start now?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">means</a> I care.
When I stop criticizing you’ll know that I’ve given up.
</p>
<p>
Alan Kay <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961">said</a> of the
Mac, it’s the first personal computer worth criticizing. That’s the
spirit.

But finally have something of an answer: if it packs a GPU, a processor
that boasts a neural processing unit and can handle VNNI and Dp4a
instructions, it qualifies – at least according to Robert Hallock,

<h1 id="2024-02-28-use-of-a-calendar">
2024-02-28 Use of a calendar
</h1>
<p>
In the last millennium, I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs
Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs
Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line
utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I
wanted an online calendar.
</p>
<p>
The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:
</p>
<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>
<p>
Back then, Google didn’t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I. I switched to
<a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.
</p>
<p>
Today,
<a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="tadzik">@tadzik</span></a> posted a link to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event
description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload
it to a CalDAV server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice!
</p>
<p>
Example usage, from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>
<p>
My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the
correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL
is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs
failed silently, some of them created new collections with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename
as the collection name… and I didn’t get an warnings or error messages.
I mean, it makes sense. It’s like a filesystem, you can save whatever
you want. But it’s not what the calendar apps expect.
</p>
<p>
So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like
<code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into
Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them
is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of
<code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That’s the one!

<p>Authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary visited former

Hungarian state media that Trump “will not give a penny in the
Ukraine-Russia war. Therefore, the war will end, because it is obvious
that Ukraine can not stand on its own feet.” Russian state media gloated
at the news, and that Trump’s MAGA allies in Congress are already

In any case, I run into the following error every so often in my Nginx
<code>error.log</code>:

<p>
The funny thing is, I <em>don’t</em> have that error when I’m running
CLI commands, like <code>vendor/bin/drush</code>, and can even install
and manage the Drupal site and database on the CLI.
</p>
<p>
The problem, in my case, was that I had applied <code>php-fpm</code>
configs using Ansible, but in my playbook I hadn’t restarted
<code>php-fpm</code> (in my case, on Ubuntu 22.04,
<code>php8.3-fpm</code>) after doing so. So FPM was running with
outdated config and didn’t know that the MySQL/MariaDB drivers were even
present on the system.

<h2 id="us-intelligence-chiefs-deliver-grim-warning-on-ukraine">US
Intelligence Chiefs Deliver Grim Warning on Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The frozen military conflict between Ukraine and Russia
is starting to thaw and will likely tilt in Moscow’s favor if the United
States fails to quickly come through with additional military aid,
according to top U.S. intelligence officials, in a grim assessment
delivered to U.S. lawmakers.</p>
<p>Monday’s warning comes nearly a month after the U.S. Senate voted in
favor of a stand-alone foreign aid bill that would send $60 billion in
aid to Ukraine as it tries to hold on to territorial gains more than two
years after Russian forces invaded.</p>
<p>But the lawmakers in the House of Representatives have refused to
bring the bill up for a vote, leaving other Western nations scrambling
to provide Ukraine with enough weapons and ammunition to hold off a
renewed Russian offensive.</p>
<p>The $60 billion “is absolutely critical to Ukraine’s defense right
now,” Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told members of the
Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>“Ukraine’s retreat from Avdiivka and their struggle to stave off
further territorial losses in the past few weeks have exposed the
erosion of Ukraine’s military capabilities with the declining
availability of external military aid,” she said. “Without that
assistance, it is hard to imagine how Ukraine will be able to maintain
the extremely hard-fought advances it has made against the
Russians.”</p>
<p>The director of the Central Intelligence Agency told lawmakers the
war is at a crossroads, and that what happens next likely hinges on the
provision of U.S. aid.</p>
<p>“The Ukrainians are not running out of courage and tenacity. They’re
running out of ammunition,” said the CIA’s William Burns. “And we’re
running out of time to help them.”</p>
<p>Both Haines and Burns reiterated previous assessments: that up until
now, Ukraine’s military has inflicted serious damage on Russia’s
forces.</p>
<p>U.S. officials believe at least 315,000 Russian troops have been
killed or wounded, and that two-thirds of Russia’s prewar tank inventory
has been destroyed. The Russian military, which had been undergoing a
modernization program, has been set back years.</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion has also served to galvanize the West, with Sweden
and Finland joining the NATO military alliance.</p>
<p>But Haines and Burns told lawmakers that none of those strategic
defeats have managed to change the calculus of Russian President
Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“Putin continues to judge that time is on his side,” Haines said,
cautioning that the Russian leader is as entrenched as ever.</p>
<p>“He continues to see NATO enlargement and Western support for Ukraine
as reinforcing his long-held belief that the United States and Europe
seek to restrict Russian power and undermine him,” she said, telling
lawmakers that Putin’s response has been to push ahead with efforts to
grow the Russian military, pouring more money into ammunition production
and into the purchase of military supplies from Iran and North
Korea.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials also see signs Putin is continuing to
move forward with plans to modernize and fortify Russia’s nuclear
weapons arsenal, already thought to be the largest and most diverse in
the world.</p>
<p>And there are signs that Russia is willing to take chances to gain an
advantage.</p>
<p>“We remain concerned that Moscow will put at risk long-standing
global norms against the use of asymmetric or strategically
destabilizing weapons, including in space and in the cyber domain,”
Haines said.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers echoed the concerns, urging colleagues to pass the
legislation to get Ukraine the military supplies it needs.</p>
<p>“My fear is the decision thus far by the House of Representatives not
to even take up legislation that would support Ukraine in the fight
against Putin aggression has been one of the most short-sighted
decisions on a national security issue that I can possibly imagine,”
said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“The impact and long-term consequences of us abandoning Ukraine …
it’s a 50-year mistake that would haunt this country,” added independent
Senator Angus King.</p>
<p>And U.S. intelligence officials warned of a cascading global impact
if the additional aid for Ukraine fails to materialize.</p>
<p>“The consequence of that will not just be for Ukraine or for European
security but across the Indo-Pacific,” said the CIA’s Burns. “If we’re
seen to be walking away from Ukraine, not only is that going to feed
doubts amongst our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, it’s going
to stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies
ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>The intelligence officials said while China remains wary, for now, it
has been emboldened by Russia.</p>
<p>In particular, the intelligence officials said Russia was forced to
grant China some long-sought concessions in exchange for support for
Moscow’s war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Iran and North Korea have likewise benefited, they said, warning the
impact remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The changing dynamics have “the potential to undermine, among other
things, long-held nonproliferation norms,” Haines said.</p>
<p>But she added that while Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are
growing closer, the prospects for a true alliance are, for now,
remote.</p>
<p>“Parochial interests, a desire to avoid entanglements, and weariness
of harm and instability from each other’s actions will likely limit
their cooperation … absent direct conflict between one of these
countries and the United States,” Haines said.</p>
<p>Israel – Gaza</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence officials also addressed concerns about the
ongoing conflict in Gaza, where Israeli forces continue to pursue
fighters of the Hamas terror group despite warnings from the United
Nations and aid groups about the devastating impact on civilians.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to work hard at this — I don’t think anybody
can guarantee success,” the CIA’s Burns told lawmakers when asked about
ongoing efforts to get a temporary cease-fire.</p>
<p>Burn recently traveled to the Middle East to meet with officials from
Israel, Egypt and Qatar.</p>
<p>He said the deal currently under consideration would provide for the
return of about 40 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, most of them
wounded or ill women or older men, in exchange for a six-week-long
cease-fire that would allow the U.S. and its allies to surge in
desperately needed aid.</p>
<p>“I understand Israel’s need, and the president [Joe Biden] has
emphasized this, to respond to the brutish attack that Israelis suffered
on the 7th of October [by Hamas],” Burns told Republican Senator Tom
Cotton.</p>
<p>“But I think we all also have to be mindful of the, you know,
enormous toll that this has taken on innocent civilians in Gaza,” he
added.</p>
<p>Gaza fallout</p>
<p>Haines further warned lawmakers that the crisis in Gaza has
“galvanized violence by a range of actors,” and that it “is likely that
the Gaza conflict will have a generational impact on terrorism.”</p>
<p>But Haines said for now, Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah,
appear reluctant to try to push too hard to manipulate the fighting for
their benefit.</p>
<p>“We continue to assess that Hezbollah and Iran do not want to cause
an escalation of the conflict that pulls us or them into a full-out
war,” she said.</p>
<p>Still, Haines acknowledged other Iranian-linked groups, like the
Houthis in Yemen, have become “aggressive actors,” launching dozens of
attacks on international shipping.</p>

State Department Requests $4 Billion To Outcompete China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States must employ “all the tools at our
disposal” to outcompete China, a top U.S. State Department official said
on Monday, as the Biden administration unveiled its budget request for
the 2025 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The request includes $4 billion over five years in mandatory funding
for this purpose, including $2 billion to create a new international
infrastructure fund to provide a credible, reliable alternative to
Chinese infrastructure funding, Deputy Secretary of State for Management
and Resources Rich Verma told a news briefing.</p>
<p>The other $2 billion was earmarked for “game-changing investments” to
help Indo-Pacific countries push back against “predatory efforts,” he
said, adding that those would include efforts to improve governance and
the rule of law.</p>
<p>The State Department requested a separate $4 billion in discretionary
funding to cover foreign assistance and diplomatic engagement in the
region.</p>
<p>U.S. efforts to fund infrastructure in developing countries have long
been dwarfed by China’s massive Belt and Road Initiative, a 10-year-old
project to build infrastructure and energy networks connecting Asia with
Africa and Europe through overland and maritime routes.</p>
<p>According to a report by U.S. researchers last November, Chinese
financial institutions lent $1.34 trillion to developing countries from
2000 to 2021.</p>
<p>“We must employ all the tools at our disposal to outcompete China,
wherever possible,” Verma said, also referring to China by the initials
of its official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>He said the request for fiscal 2025 would allow the U.S. “to continue
to invest in the foundations of our strength at home, align with
like-minded partners to strengthen our shared interests and address the
challenges posed by the PRC, and harness those assets to compete with
the PRC and defend our interests.”</p>
<p>Verma said the infrastructure fund would support “transformative,
quality and sustainable hard infrastructure projects.”</p>
<p>At the 2023 G20 Summit in India, U.S. officials said President Joe
Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi co-hosted a group of G20
leaders to accelerate investments in high-quality infrastructure
projects and development of economic corridors through a Partnership for
Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).</p>
<p>This came after the Group of Seven rich Western countries’ leaders
pledged in 2022 to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over
five years to finance needed infrastructure in developing countries and
counter the Belt and Road project.</p>
<p>Overseas finance has won Beijing friends across the developing world,
while drawing criticism from the West and in some recipient countries,
including Sri Lanka and Zambia, that infrastructure projects it funded
saddled them with debt they were unable to repay.</p>

<h2
id="former-us-officials-work-for-chinese-client-stirs-concern-over-disclosure-loopholes">Former
US Official’s Work for Chinese Client Stirs Concern Over Disclosure
Loopholes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When a Chinese drone company came under U.S. government
scrutiny over its alleged ties to China’s military, the company turned
to one of America’s pre-eminent lawyers: Loretta Lynch, a former
attorney general in the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Lynch, who ran the U.S. Department of Justice from 2015 to 2017 and
is now a partner at the Paul, Weiss law firm, wrote a letter to a senior
Defense Department official last July on behalf of SZ DJI Technology Co
Ltd, asking that her client be removed from a list of Chinese military
companies.</p>
<p>Advocating for foreign clients is legal and U.S. law includes a
public disclosure exemption for lawyers.</p>
<p>But the letter, seen by Reuters, is an example of what transparency
advocates and some members of Congress - dozens of whom have supported
bills to change rules - say are gaps in the law that allow lawyers and
lobbyists, including former officials, to avoid disclosing their
advocacy for companies possibly subject to U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>The Paul, Weiss law firm declined to comment on the letter, and Lynch
did not respond to Reuters emails. DJI also declined to comment, but it
has said previously that it is not a military company and that it was
prepared to formally challenge its inclusion on the list.</p>
<p>The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a decades-old law
requiring public disclosure of work done on behalf of non-U.S. entities,
includes a list of exemptions, including for commercial activities and
legal representation.</p>
<p>The work by the onetime top U.S. law enforcement officer on behalf of
a company the Department of Defense says poses “threats to national
security” comes as U.S. agencies warn about companies with links to
China’s Communist Party and as lawmakers push to tighten FARA’s
disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments say DJI supported
biometric surveillance and tracking of Muslim Uyghur minorities in
China.</p>
<p>The Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment on
Lynch’s letter. DJI remained on the Pentagon list when it was updated in
late January.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also declined comment on the letter and
broader FARA enforcement.</p>
<p>Almost a dozen critics of FARA told Reuters the law’s loopholes have
allowed less transparency for other companies with alleged ties to
China’s military, including surveillance technology firm Hikvision and
biotech firm WuXi AppTec.</p>
<p>Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, says reforms to the law are needed, given the blurry lines
between many Chinese companies and the Chinese government, and to keep
former members of the U.S. government from effectively lobbying on their
behalf.</p>
<p>“It is appalling that former senior U.S. officials use their
connections to serve the interests of U.S. adversaries,” Risch said.</p>
<p>However, the American Civil Liberties Union and others assert that
broadening disclosure requirements could act as a barrier to legally
protected free speech.</p>
<p>In 2022 the ACLU and 13 other groups wrote to the Justice Department
about their concerns, cautioning that problems with the law could
“enable selective enforcement for bad faith or malicious reasons.”</p>
<p>Others argue that stricter FARA rules on disclosure could give
authoritarian countries like Russia and China cover for their own
stifling of free speech.</p>
<p>Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law school professor,
said some countries, such as Russia, label citizens and reporters as
foreign agents to limit their activities.</p>
<p>“I do have concerns over some past investigations and prosecutions
that targeted individuals who appeared to be engaging in First Amendment
activities,” Turley told Reuters.</p>
<p>Requesting a meeting</p>
<p>The Pentagon in 2022 placed DJI on its Chinese Military Companies
list, a designation that serves as a warning about the risks of
conducting business with those entities.</p>
<p>In her letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Taylor-Kale on
behalf of DJI, Lynch urged the department to promptly remove the drone
maker.</p>
<p>“The wide use and dependence on DJI products by a variety of U.S.
stakeholders reinforces the importance and urgency of deleting DJI from
the list,” Lynch wrote.</p>
<p>She added that DJI requested “a meeting to discuss this matter.”
Reuters could not establish whether that meeting occurred.</p>
<p>Also signing the letter, labeled “confidential treatment requested,”
were former Assistant United States Attorney Michael Gertzman and
Associate White House Counsel in the Obama administration Roberto
Gonzalez – now both partners at Paul, Weiss.</p>
<p>Gertzman and Gonzalez did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>FARA enforcement has intensified in recent years, with the Justice
Department prosecuting individuals for their work on behalf of Chinese
interests and pushing some law firms to register.</p>
<p>Paul, Weiss attorneys have acknowledged growing enforcement tied to
China.</p>
<p>In a 2022 memo to clients about a U.S. court’s dismissal of a FARA
case against casino magnate Steve Wynn, Lynch, Gonzalez and other Paul,
Weiss attorneys wrote: “The targeting of lobbying on behalf of China by
the DOJ is further evidence of the Biden Administration’s intention to
use all of the legal tools at its disposal in a multi-faceted strategy
to counter the perceived threat posed by China.”</p>
<p>Paul, Weiss did not respond to questions about the memo and a White
House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>At the Justice Department’s request, the Sidley Austin law firm in
2022 retroactively registered its lobbying on behalf of Hikvision, a
company the U.S. says has been implicated in human rights violations
toward Uyghurs.</p>
<p>Sidley Austin declined to comment on its registration. While the firm
had not originally filed under FARA it had disclosed under the Lobbying
Disclosure Act, which has less rigorous disclosure requirements,
according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has called for the repeal of an LDA exemption
from FARA filing.</p>
<p>Hikvision did not respond to a request for comment but has previously
denied reports that the company is complicit in human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Congressional pressure again has begun to tick up.</p>
<p>On March 5, the House of Representatives select committee on China
asked the Justice Department to review trade association Biotechnology
Innovation Organization’s lobbying on behalf of Chinese biotech firm
WuXi AppTec for possible FARA requirements.</p>
<p>BIO told Reuters that its advocacy was fulfilling its duty to let
Congress and patients know the impact of potential policies and “nothing
more.”</p>
<p>WuXi AppTec, when asked by Reuters about the House committee’s
request, said it objected to “inaccurate assertions and preemptive
actions against our company without due process,” adding it was
confident lawmakers would see it as a trusted partner.</p>
<p>Reform is up to Congress</p>
<p>Some experts, including those who have concerns about extending
FARA’s reach, agree the law is vague and presents particular challenges
for attorneys.</p>
<p>David Laufman, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who previously
oversaw the Justice Department’s FARA enforcement, said while lawyers
may not need to register under FARA if they avoid policy discussions
with government officials, the only way to know for certain is to seek
an opinion from the Justice Department.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, life goes on for attorneys. We have to represent
our clients,” he said.</p>
<p>Reforms to the law would be up to Congress. Several bipartisan bills
to close FARA loopholes have been proposed.</p>
<p>One, proposed last year in the House and Senate, could require
retroactive FARA registration by anyone who acts as an “agent for a
foreign principal.”</p>

id="palaus-president-relieved-by-security-pact-funding-approval">Palau’s
President Relieved by Security Pact Funding Approval</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Critical funds to counter China in the Pacific are
finally on their way to three U.S. allies: Palau, Micronesia and the
Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Senate passed a funding package that provides $7
billion over 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) as
part of a partial government funding bill. It was signed into law by
President Joe Biden over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Extending Compact-related assistance is a critical component of the
administration’s Pacific Partnership, Indo-Pacific, and National
Security Strategies,” said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a
statement. “We look forward to working with our partners in the Freely
Associated States over the next two decades of COFA-related
cooperation.”</p>
<p>The compacts are agreements that give the U.S. strategic access to
these regions of the Pacific Ocean. In return, the U.S. provides grants
to fund education, health care and infrastructure in these nations,
whose citizens are then entitled to study, work and live in the U.S.
without a visa.</p>
<p>The United States has had compact agreements in effect with
Micronesia and the Marshalls since 1986 and with Palau since 1994.</p>
<p>The compacts’ renewals were signed last year but funding stalled as
U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach agreement on full-year spending. Palau
has been forced to borrow to pay for basic government services like
education and health care while waiting for $890 million — its share of
the funds.</p>
<p>“It’s not Oct. 1, but it’s at least within this fiscal year, and
really just in time,” Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. told VOA in an
interview on Monday.</p>
<p>“[This] allows us to stop borrowing to keep government operations
going; it allows us to hire those critical police officers, health care
workers and education teachers that we need,” he said.</p>
<p>Palau’s economy tanked after Chinese tourism dropped by more than 50%
in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The island nation maintains
diplomatic relations with Taiwan under repeated pressure from Beijing to
switch alliances.</p>
<p>Whipps says he recently met with investors from Singapore and Japan,
as well as United Airlines with a request for direct service to Japan.
He said now that COFA is funded, he can promise a stable and secure
environment to financiers.</p>
<p>“[It’s important that we’re] opening up new markets so that we’re
diversified and more resilient, not so dependent on the Chinese tourism,
which could be weaponized,” said Whipps.</p>
<p>Coordinated push</p>
<p>The final passage comes after a coordinated pressure campaign, from
members of Congress as well as the Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The COFA agreements send a clear message of U.S. commitment to the
Pacific region and take a much-needed international strong stand for the
ideals of democracy and freedom,” American Samoa Representative Aumua
Amata Coleman Radewagen said in a statement after the House passed COFA
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I’ve appreciated the partnership of my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle and thank the many advocates – in Hawaii and in COFA
communities across the country – whose hard work made this victory
possible,” Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono said in a statement after the
Senate passed COFA, Friday.</p>
<p>The leaders of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands joined Whipps in
February in drafting a letter to congressional leaders warning of the
consequences of not funding the compacts.</p>
<p>Like Palau, the Marshall Islands maintains diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, while Micronesia has diplomatic relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>“There have been ‘carrot and stick’ efforts from the PRC [People’s
Republic of China] to shift our alliances, including discontinuing
support of Taiwan,” Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine wrote in the
February letter.</p>
<p>At a Nuclear Remembrance Day ceremony in the Marshall Islands on
March 1, President Heine said the funding delay had created doubt.</p>
<p>“At some point, our nation needs to seriously consider other options
available to us if the U.S. is unable or unwilling to keep its
commitments to us. Our nation has been a steadfast ally of the United
States, but that should not be taken for granted,” she told the
audience.</p>
<p>Delay sends signal</p>
<p>Experts say Washington’s funding delay sent a signal to the rest of
the Pacific that undermines U.S. credibility.</p>
<p>“They see our agreements with these three Pacific nations as the
bellwether for our entire engagement with the region,” Kathryn Hendel
Paik, Center for Strategic and International Studies senior fellow, said
Monday in an interview with VOA.</p>
<p>“Our waffling on this has really made them question a relationship
that they were already starting to be skeptical on because,
historically, we have not always been there for the Pacific and we’ve
not always showed up the way we should have,” she said.</p>
<p>Charles Paul, Marshall Islands ambassador to the U.S., told VOA via
Zoom on Monday, “We’re looking forward to having the compacts
approved.”</p>
<p>He added that the agreement includes about $700 million to address
the health impacts of radiation introduced in the 67 American
atmospheric nuclear tests between 1946 and 1958.</p>
<p>In a 13-minute video posted Saturday on Facebook, Wesley Sinima,
president of the Federated States of Micronesia, said the funding delay
stirred up “doubt and uncertainty.” He added, however, that the final
agreement will “contribute to greater peace and prosperity” for the
Micronesian people and “greater security and stability for the
Indo-Pacific region and the world.”</p>
<p>As for Palau, President Whipps said he’s been invited to Washington
in the coming weeks for an exchange of diplomatic notes to finalize the
compacts. He hopes to attend.</p>

Commits $100 Million More to Multinational Force for Haiti Amid
Violence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced
on Monday the United States would commit an additional $100 million to a
United Nations-backed multinational security force intended to assist
Haitian police in combating gangs, along with $33 million in
humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>This would bring the total of U.S. contribution to the security force
to $300 million.</p>
<p>In February, the United States pledged $200 million to support the
Kenya-led Multinational Security Support mission, or MSS, in Haiti. The
U.S. said that the deployment of the mission will help the Haitian
National Police create the security conditions necessary to conduct free
and fair elections.</p>
<p>Monday, Blinken joined Caribbean leaders in Kingston, Jamaica, to
discuss a proposal to “expedite a political transition” to resolve the
unfolding crisis in Haiti, including possible deployment of the
U.N.-backed multinational security forces.</p>
<p>The proposal, developed in partnership with the Caribbean Community,
known as CARICOM, and Haitian stakeholders, comes as Haitian Prime
Minister Ariel Henry faces pressure to resign or agree to a transitional
council.</p>
<p>According to a statement by U.S. officials, the transition would
occur via “the creation of a broad-based, independent presidential
college,” a reference to a proposed committee that would oversee Haiti
ahead of elections.</p>
<p>In Kingston, Blinken said that the Haitian people are confronting “a
political crisis, escalating violence, unrest,” an “untenable situation”
that requires urgent action both politically and in terms of
security.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA that the United
States aims to accelerate the deployment of the U.N.-backed mission U.N.
Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission in Haiti, because
escalating gang violence is endangering its government.</p>
<p>“We continue to look to expedite that mission as soon as possible,”
Miller said during a Monday briefing, adding the U.S. has been in
conversation about the deployment with the government of Kenya and other
countries.</p>
<p>“I can assure you that the United States will do its part to fund
that important mission,” Miller said.</p>
<p>UN reaction</p>
<p>At the United Nations, all 15 U.N. Security Council members strongly
condemned “the increasing violence, criminal activities, mass
displacement of civilians and human rights abuses” in a Monday
statement.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ chief of staff is
representing the U.N. at the CARICOM meeting in Kingston.</p>
<p>“The MSS mission is a critical step toward creating an environment
conducive to free and fair elections, as well as alleviating the
humanitarian crisis,” said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.</p>
<p>The expedient MSS deployment is a top priority for U.S. President Joe
Biden’s administration, she said.</p>
<p>Canada has committed $91.2 million, and others, including Benin,
France, Germany, Jamaica and Spain, have announced financial, personnel
and logistical support.</p>
<p>Sunday, the U.S. military airlifted nonessential embassy personnel
from Haiti and deployed additional U.S. forces to reinforce embassy
security. This operation is in response to escalating gang violence that
has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and threatens to
bring down the government.</p>
<p>The State Department said the security situation in Haiti is
“unpredictable and dangerous,” and the U.S. Embassy’s ability to assist
U.S. citizens is “severely limited.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The State Department’s travel advisory for Haiti has remained at
Level Four — do not travel to Haiti — since July 2023.</p>
<p>“U.S. Embassy Port-au-Prince has been on Ordered Departure status
since July 27, 2023. Adjustments during this time are not uncommon, nor
do they represent a change in our overall posture,” a State Department
spokesperson told VOA.</p>
<p>Concerns from critics</p>
<p>Some critics note that while both Democratic and Republican lawmakers
support ensuring a more stable Haiti, some are concerned about the Biden
administration’s policy toward the nation.</p>
<p>Ana Rosa Quintana-Lovett, a senior policy director for the Vandenberg
Coalition think tank in Washington, said Haiti’s political future is not
being driven by Haitians but rather by the international donor
community.</p>
<p>She told VOA Monday that Haitian Prime Minister Henry’s “leadership
is untenable” and that Henry fails to grasp that he does not have the
support of the Haitian people.</p>
<p>“The United States needs to understand that whatever diplomatic
messages they are publicly releasing, frankly, are falling on (Henry’s)
deaf ears,” she added.</p>
<p>She also pointed out congressional concerns over proposed Kenyan-led
multinational forces. “Kenyan forces don’t speak Creole, so how are they
going to engage and work with the Haitian National Police? I mean, there
are just so many loopholes in the approach,” she said.</p>
<p>Dire situation</p>
<p>Haiti declared a state of emergency on March 3, following attacks by
gangs on the main prisons in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Prime
Minister Henry was in Kenya at the time, finalizing a deal for a
U.N.-supported peacekeeping mission aimed at addressing Haiti’s gang
violence.</p>
<p>The gangs demanded Henry’s resignation. He is reportedly stranded in
the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Amid escalating gang violence in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian
government extended the state of emergency until April 3, and the
nighttime curfew until Monday.</p>
<p>According to the International Organization for Migration’s office in
Haiti, the violence perpetrated by armed gangs has forced over 360,000
people across Haiti to flee their homes.</p>
<p>UNICEF has warned that critical social services in Haiti are on the
verge of collapse, and that the humanitarian response that millions of
children and civilians rely on as a last resort has been severely
impaired.</p>
<p>Political transition process</p>
<p>Henry was appointed, not elected, after the assassination of
President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Henry had initially promised to step
down by early February but later said security must be reestablished
first to conduct free and fair elections.</p>
<p>On February 29, CARICOM said the Haitian prime minister had committed
to organizing general elections by August 31, 2025. CARICOM stated its
intention to send an assessment team by March 31 of this year to
evaluate electoral needs, aiming to support the planning and
establishment of relevant institutions.</p>

Needs $10B to Replace Weapons Already Sent to Ukraine, Officials
Say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The Pentagon has a funding shortfall of about $10 billion
for U.S. military weapons needed to replace those already sent to
Ukraine, a shortfall that requires additional money from Congress to
fix, top Defense Department officials said Monday.</p>
<p>“We don’t foresee a likely alternative outside of the supplemental
funding [bill] or having that money added into an appropriations bill in
order to achieve the replenishment that we need,” Deputy Secretary of
Defense Kathleen Hicks told reporters.</p>
<p>“We are probably looking at about $10 billion to replace everything,
everything that we’ve given in terms of supplies to Ukraine,” one
official told VOA.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials expected to get the funding to replenish those
stocks in a supplemental request from the Biden administration, which
included billions of additional dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel and
Taiwan. However, Congress has yet to pass a supplemental aid bill
because of arguments on spending and U.S. border security.</p>
<p>The shortfall is tied to the way the Pentagon has accounted for the
aid sent to Ukraine. Last June, the Pentagon said it overestimated the
value of weapons sent to Ukraine by about $6.2 billion over the past two
years.</p>
<p>When calculating its aid package estimates, the Department of Defense
was counting the cost incurred to replace the weapons given to Ukraine,
while it said it should have been totaling the cost of the systems
actually sent, officials told VOA at the time.</p>
<p>The error provided the Pentagon the legal cover needed to send more
aid to Ukraine, but the problem remained that more funds would be needed
to replenish U.S. military stockpiles with newer, costlier weapons.</p>
<p>Failing to replenish U.S. stockpiles would negatively affect the
military’s readiness, another defense official told VOA.</p>
<p>The department still has about $4 billion in authority to send aid to
Ukraine, but Pentagon officials have told reporters that sending
additional aid without the ability to replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles
would be a risk the Defense Department is not willing to take at this
time.</p>
<p>But Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst with the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA there are key weapons
the U.S. could send Kyiv without compromising military readiness,
“because the Army no longer needs them.”</p>
<p>One weapon would be 155-millimeter cluster munitions, which
Montgomery says the U.S. doesn’t use in combat planning.</p>
<p>“That would give 155-mm ammunition to the Ukrainians very quickly,”
he said.</p>
<p>Another weapon that could be immediately sent without incurring a
cost on U.S. military readiness would be M113 armored vehicles.</p>
<p>“We have thousands of them that we’re getting rid of. We could
transfer these to Ukraine,” he told VOA.</p>

<h2 id="where-heat-pumps-win-and-where-they-lose">Where Heat Pumps Win —
And Where They Lose</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTcwNTg4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDUxMTcxOH0.EfoDR6BjMqogYUTSURSlHzSiLZivCxFdUc6tmfw82sw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Some Americans install heat pumps because they care about climate
change. But most people aren’t going to make the switch until it makes
sense economically. Pinpointing where and for whom heat pumps are a good
investment is surprisingly tricky because U.S. housing is so diverse,
with a wide range of building sizes and ages, situated in different
local climates with different utility rates.
</p>
<p>
But for the first time, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab
have sorted through much of this complexity to get deeper to the truth
about the costs, benefits, and challenges of deploying heat pumps in the
U.S.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, they
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2024/benefits-of-heat-pumps-detailed-in-new-nrel-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that heat pumps are a cost-effective choice in roughly 65 million U.S.
homes, or about 60% of the country — and that’s before taking into
account available subsidies. But there are substantial economic barriers
to widespread adoption.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to overstate how detailed the study is. The authors started
with a model of 550,000 statistically representative households —
basically housing archetypes that typify different combinations of
building size, age, occupancy level, local climate, heating usage
patterns, and existing heating systems. Each one represents about 242
real-world households. Then the authors looked at how switching to a
heat pump would affect greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills across
all of these different homes in a wide range of scenarios. They
considered heat pumps with lower and higher efficiency ratings, and
whether or not the building owner pursued insulation upgrades. They
looked at different scenarios for how quickly the grid would
decarbonize, how sensitive the results were to energy prices, and how
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self">subsidies
from the Inflation Reduction Act</a> affect the economics.
</p>
<p>
The paper has many interesting findings beyond the top-line result. Here
are five things that stood out.
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Heat pumps will lower greenhouse gas emissions immediately, period.
</h2>
<p>
Eric Wilson, a senior research engineer at NREL and the study’s lead
author, told me one of his motivations was to try to settle the question
of whether heat pumps reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
“I see a lot of people saying, well, the grid is still dirty in this
state, and maybe it makes sense to wait five years to put in a heat pump
because it could increase emissions,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But he found that in each of the 48 contiguous U.S. states, switching to
a heat pump reduces emissions today, even if that heat pump is one of
the cheaper, less-efficient models. Heat pumps are just so much more
efficient than other options that they still reduce emissions despite
today’s relatively dirty grid.
</p>
<p>
On average, each home could cut between 2.5 to 4.4 tons of carbon over
the approximately 16 years the equipment lasts, meaning widespread
adoption could result in a 5% to 9% drop in national economy-wide
emissions. The effect is much more pronounced in some states, like those
in the Northeast, where a lot of homes currently use fossil fuels for
heating. A household in Maine that installs a high efficiency model,
combined with completing insulation upgrades, would reduce emissions by
an average of 11 tons per year — or about the equivalent of taking two
cars off the road for a year.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The best heat pumps need to get a lot cheaper.
</h2>
<p>
The study breaks down the costs of switching to a heat pump in a few
different ways.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s the up-front costs of upgrading to a heat pump, which are
relatively high. A lower-rated, less efficient heat pump system may be a
cheaper option than a new furnace or boiler for about 43% of households.
But a higher-performing heat pump is almost always more expensive,
costing an extra $8,000 to $13,000 before government subsidies (more on
them later). That alone might keep heat pumps out of reach for many
households.
</p>
<p>
Next, there’s the potential for bill savings — which is significant.
Using state average electricity and gas rates in the winter of 2021 to
2022, the study found that 86% of households can save money on their
utility bills by switching to a medium-efficiency heat pump, and a
whopping 95% of households will see their bills go down if they install
the highest efficiency system.
</p>
<p>
So in theory, if homeowners do have the extra cash to put down, there’s
a chance they could make up for high up-front costs in bill savings over
time. But how good a chance?
</p>
<p>
Putting this all together, the authors looked at what percentage of
households that upgraded to heat pumps would see a positive cash flow,
calculated as the “net present value,” from the initial investment.
Here, the results were less rosy. In many cases, high up-front costs
cancel out potential savings. For example, despite the near-certain bill
savings from buying one of the most efficient heat pump models, only 21%
of households would see an overall economic benefit from the switch.
</p>
<p>
Still, more than half of all homes would see a positive cash flow by
switching to a cheaper, minimum-efficiency heat pump.

</small>
</p>
<p>
These findings underscore the importance of bringing down the cost of
more efficient heat pump models, which are out of reach for many
Americans but can provide significant energy bill savings. The authors
suggest that policymakers can help by deploying incentives more
strategically and pursuing research on “lower-cost, higher performance,
and easier to install equipment.” There also may be opportunities for
bulk purchasing and aggregating installations across an apartment
building or neighborhood.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Heat pumps almost always beat propane, fuel oil, or electric
resistance heaters. Natural gas is more complicated.
</h2>
<p>
When it comes to bill savings, the study found that those who have
systems that run on propane, fuel oil, or electric resistance heaters
will pretty much always lower their bills by switching to a heat pump,
no matter how efficient it is. But those who use natural gas are far
more likely to lower their bills if they can afford to switch to one of
the pricier, better-performing heat pumps — which cuts into the value
proposition.
</p>
<p>
The following maps show the percentage of homes in each state that would
see a positive cash flow from switching to a heat pump, looking at those
switching from natural gas, electric resistance, or fuel oil and
propane, illustrating how the value proposition is most challenging for
those using natural gas.<span></span>

</p>
<p>
The authors also note that fixed charges on natural gas bills can play a
significant role in the economics of switching to a heat pump. Most
natural gas utilities charge customers a fixed amount each month,
regardless of how much gas they use. If a homeowner switches to heat
pumps but continues using gas for cooking, they’ll still have to pay the
full fee, which can be as high as $34 a month, whereas homes that fully
electrify can avoid these fees.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Heat pumps might increase costs for homes without air conditioners.
</h2>
<p>
The results I described in the previous two sections include homes both
with and without existing air conditioning systems of some kind. (With
the exception of the maps, which only consider homes that have air
conditioning already.)

<p>
But since heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, the economics are
actually quite different for those households who already have air
conditioners versus those who don’t. If a household already has A/C,
heat pumps appear more favorable, because a family would be able to
replace two systems — an air conditioner and a furnace — with just one.
If there is no pre-existing air conditioner, the heat pump will not only
have higher up-front costs, but it’s more likely to increase energy
bills, since the family might start using the heat pump for cooling in
addition to heating.

Here are the same maps included in the previous section, but looking
just at homes that do not have air conditioning.<span></span>

</p>
<p>
There are basically zero cases where a house with natural gas heating,
and no A/C, will save by switching to a heat pump. However, that result
doesn’t take into account the benefits of getting air conditioning for
the first time.
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t include the new value that someone has, especially in a
warming world and a world with more heat waves, of now having an air
conditioner in your home,” Kevin Kircher, an assistant professor of
mechanical engineering at Purdue University, told me. “So if you add
that in, I think the economics look better.”
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>All signs point to the economics of heat pumps improving.
</h2>
<p>
None of the results in the previous sections take into account the
various subsidies that states and the federal government offer for heat
pumps. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act included a $2,000 tax
credit for heat pumps and an additional $11,500 in rebates for low- and
moderate-income households. Both will increase the percentage of
households for whom the investment will pencil out.
</p>
<p>
The study also doesn’t take into account the potential for homes to use
smart controls that optimize their systems, or the opportunity for
households to participate in demand response programs which will pay
them to turn down their thermostats by a few degrees when the grid is
taxed. Kircher, the Purdue professor, recently
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261924002034?casa_token=b1I2w61GKBoAAAAA:D51GrUXBwuRVh3We1XBqra_IRltnXLWwpvni4pwSbumyjprx0bhq50BLmm3E9xFUobRn1qxGG7c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published
a study</a> of a real-world house in a cold climate where smart controls
reduced heating energy costs by 23-34%.
</p>
<p>
Finally, one big takeaway from the study was that the results are very
sensitive to the price ratio between natural gas rates and electricity
rates, and there are reasons to believe that may become more favorable.
For example, as more renewable energy is deployed, electricity could
become more affordable. Meanwhile, if the U.S. increases exports of
liquified natural gas, the cost of domestic natural gas could go up. The
study cites a 2022 survey of oil and gas executives which found that 69%
expect ’’the age of inexpensive U.S. natural gas to end by year-end
2025.”
</p>
<p>
“Big modeling like this entails a lot of assumptions about the future
that are really hard to pin down with any real precision,” said Kircher.
“But I think there’s cause for optimism there.”

Assessing Expansion of Chip Export Controls Impacting China’s
Military</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, Philippines — The United States is constantly assessing the
need to expand export controls to stop China from acquiring advanced
computer chips and manufacturing equipment that could be used to boost
its military, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. export controls were launched in 2022 to counter the use of
chips for military applications that include the development of
hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Commerce Department broadened the export
controls, sparking protests from China’s Commerce Ministry that the
restrictions violated international trade rules and “seriously threaten
the stability of industrial supply chains.” </p>
<p>China said it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard its
rights and interests and urged Washington to lift the export controls as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>‘Are we doing enough?’</p>
<p>Asked if the U.S. was planning to further broaden the chip export
controls to China, Raimondo said in a news conference in Manila that it
was constantly under consideration.</p>
<p>“We look at this every single day,” Raimondo said. “Technology is
changing faster than ever, which means we have to wake up every day and
ask ourselves, ‘Are we doing enough?’”</p>
<p>She said her job “is to protect the American people” and to make sure
China cannot access sophisticated U.S. technologies - including
semiconductor technology and artificial intelligence technology - that
could be used to bolster the Chinese military.</p>
<p>The U.S. would continue to sell semiconductors worth billions of
dollars to China, Raimondo said.</p>
<p>“I want to be clear. We have no interest to decouple our economies,”
she said, but added, “We cannot allow China to have access, for their
military advancement, to our more sophisticated technology.”</p>
<p>‘Ironclad’ relationship</p>
<p>Raimondo said she was sent by President Joe Biden to Manila with a
delegation of executives from 22 American companies, which she said plan
to invest about $1 billion in the Philippines, Washington’s oldest
treaty ally in Asia. The U.S. investments would include training large
numbers of Filipinos to attain high-tech skills that could help them
land high-salary jobs, she said.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-Philippine alliance is ironclad. It is sustained over 72
years, and we remain steadfast friends and increasingly partners in
prosperity,” she said.</p>
<p>Raimondo met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and quoted him as saying
“he cannot imagine the Philippines’ future without a close bond with the
United States.”</p>
<p>“I want to say here today: The feeling is mutual,” Raimondo said.
“But President Biden acknowledges we can do more.”</p>
<p>Marcos invited businesses from the U.S., the third-largest trading
partner of the Philippines, to invest in more than 198 planned
infrastructure projects worth $148 billion.</p>

Teachers Can Discuss Sexual Orientation, Gender ID Under ‘Don’t Say Gay’
Bill Settlement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>orlando, fla. — Students and teachers will be able to speak freely
about sexual orientation and gender identity in Florida classrooms,
provided it’s not part of instruction, under a settlement reached Monday
between Florida education officials and civil rights attorneys who had
challenged a state law which critics dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”</p>
<p>The settlement clarifies what is allowed in Florida classrooms
following passage two years ago of the law prohibiting instruction on
sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. Opponents said
the law had created confusion about whether teachers could identity
themselves as LGBTQ+ or if they even could have rainbow stickers in
classrooms.</p>
<p>Other states used the Florida law as a template to pass prohibitions
on classroom instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation.
Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina are among
the states with versions of the law.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the Florida Board of Education
will send instructions to every school district saying the Florida law
doesn’t prohibit discussing LGBTQ+ people, nor prevent anti-bullying
rules on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or disallow
Gay-Straight Alliance groups. The settlement also spells out that the
law is neutral — meaning what applies to LGBTQ+ people also applies to
heterosexual people — and that it doesn’t apply to library books not
being used for instruction in the classroom.</p>
<p>The law also doesn’t apply to books with incidental references to
LGBTQ+ characters or same-sex couples, “as they are not instruction on
sexual orientation or gender identity any more than a math problem
asking students to add bushels of apples is instruction on apple
farming,” according to the settlement.</p>
<p>“What this settlement does, is, it re-establishes the fundamental
principal, that I hope all Americans agree with, which is every kid in
this country is entitled to an education at a public school where they
feel safe, their dignity is respected and where their families and
parents are welcomed,” Roberta Kaplan, the lead attorney for the
plaintiffs, said in an interview. “This shouldn’t be a controversial
thing.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ office described the
deal as a “major win” with the law formally known as the Parental Rights
in Education Act remaining intact.</p>
<p>“We fought hard to ensure this law couldn’t be maligned in court, as
it was in the public arena by the media and large corporate actors,”
said Ryan Newman, an attorney for the state of Florida. “We are
victorious, and Florida’s classrooms will remain a safe place under the
Parental Rights in Education Act.”</p>
<p>The law has been championed by the Republican governor since before
its passage in 2022 by the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature. It barred
instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten
through the third grade, and it was expanded to all grades last
year.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers had argued that parents should broach these
subjects with children and that the law protected children from being
taught about inappropriate material.</p>
<p>But opponents of the law said it created a chilling effect in
classrooms. Some teachers said they were unsure if they could mention or
display a photo of their same-sex partner in the classroom. In some
cases, books dealing with LGBTQ+ topics were removed from classrooms and
lines mentioning sexual orientation were excised from school musicals.
The Miami-Dade County School Board in 2022 decided not to adopt a
resolution recognizing LGBTQ History Month, even though it had done so a
year earlier.</p>
<p>The law also triggered the ongoing legal battles between DeSantis and
Disney over control of the governing district for Walt Disney World in
central Florida after DeSantis took control of the government in what
the company described as retaliation for its opposition to the
legislation. DeSantis touted the fight with Disney during his run for
the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, which he ended earlier this
year.</p>
<p>The civil rights attorneys sued Florida education officials on behalf
of teachers, students and parents, claiming the law was
unconstitutional, but the case was dismissed last year by a federal
judge in Tallahassee who said they lacked standing to sue. The case was
appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Kaplan said they believed the appellate court would have reversed the
lower court’s decision, but continuing the lawsuit would have delayed
any resolution for several more years.</p>
<p>“The last thing we wanted for the kids in Florida was more delay,”
Kaplan said.</p>

id="us-canada-indigenous-groups-have-proposal-to-address-cross-border-mining">US,
Canada, Indigenous Groups Have Proposal to Address Cross-Border
Mining</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>billings, mont. — The U.S., Canada and several Indigenous groups
announced a proposal Monday to address pollution from coal mining in
British Columbia that officials say has been contaminating waterways and
harming fisheries on both sides of the border for years.</p>
<p>The proposal would be executed through a century-old U.S.-Canada
boundary waters treaty, establishing independent boards to study the
pollution’s extent and make cleanup recommendations.</p>
<p>Details were obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the
proposal’s public release. It comes after Indigenous groups in British
Columbia, Montana and Idaho lobbied for more than a decade for the
federal governments in the U.S. and Canada to intervene and stop the
flow of pollution.</p>
<p>Scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency several
years ago confirmed high levels of selenium in fish and eggs in
Montana’s Kootenai River downstream of Lake Koocanusa, which straddles
the U.S. Canada border. The chemical, released when coal is mined and
washed during processing, can be toxic to fish, aquatic insects and the
birds that feed on them.</p>
<p>Some members of the Ktunaxa Nation — which includes two tribes in the
U.S. and four first nations in Canada — depend on those fish populations
for sustenance.</p>
<p>“The fish, especially the smaller ones, you see a lot of damage.
You’re starting to get abnormalities in their bodies, reproductive
issues,” said Tom McDonald, vice chairman of the Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes in northwestern Montana. “It has to stop.”</p>
<p>Selenium concentrations in water entering Lake Koocanusa have been
increasing for decades, and studies have shown it’s coming from coal
mines in the Elk River valley of British Columbia. The Elk River drains
into the Kootenai before it crosses the border into Montana, then flows
into Idaho and eventually joins the Columbia River.</p>
<p>Diplomatic groundwork for Monday’s proposal was laid last year, when
President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in March
2023 that the U.S. and Canada hoped to reach an “agreement in principle”
in the following months to reduce the pollution in the Elk-Kootenai
watershed in partnership with tribes and first nations.</p>
<p>“All the parties know that time is of the essence,” said Stephenne
Harding, senior director for lands at the White House Council on
Environmental Quality. “The pollution levels in this system are
increasing and we need shared solutions to protect people and species.
This process helps bring together all the data and the knowledge … so we
have it in one place where we can make important decisions.”</p>
<p>Gary Aitken Jr., vice chairman of the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, said
tribal leaders have been lobbying for federal intervention for at least
12 years.</p>
<p>“It’s been frustrating,” he said. “We hope it’s a turning point and
that the governments will work in good faith to finally begin” cleanup
work.</p>
<p>The proposal — submitted through a bilateral panel known as the
International Joint Commission — calls for no more than two years of
study to gauge the extent of pollution.</p>
<p>The goal is to develop a plan to reduce pollution impacts “as quickly
as possible,” said U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rachel
Poynter.</p>
<p>“This is a first step, and we recognize that, but it is a critical
key first step,” Poynter said.</p>
<p>Officials from Montana, Idaho and British Columbia also would be
invited to participate.</p>
<p>Senator Jon Tester of Montana issued a statement saying he’s pleased
that officials in Canada are involved after previous complaints from
tribes that they were not cooperating.</p>
<p>“I’ll continue to put pressure on the State Department to hold the
Canadian government accountable,” the Democratic lawmaker added.</p>
<p>A Canadian coal company paid a $60 million fine in 2021 after
pleading guilty in a court case involving pollution discharges in
British Columbia blamed for harming fish populations. Investigators
found Teck Resources Limited discharged hazardous amounts of selenium
and calcite from two coal mines.</p>
<p>Teck Resources spokesperson Chris Stannell said in response to
Monday’s proposal that the company is making progress in improving water
quality. It has built four water treatment plants that are removing at
least 95% of the selenium from treated water, he said, with six more
treatment plants planned by 2027.</p>
<p>Coal from the region is mined through a highly disruptive method
known as mountaintop removal and sold to foundries for steel and metal
production.</p>

ToS update allegedly locks Roku devices until users give in</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roku customers are threatening to stop using, or to even dispose of,
their low-priced TVs and streaming gadgets after the company appears to
be locking devices for people who don’t conform to the recently updated
terms of service (ToS). This month, users on Roku’s support forums
reported suddenly seeing a message when turning on their Roku TV or
streaming device reading: “We’ve made an important update: We’ve updated
our Dispute Resolution Terms. Select ‘Agree’ to agree to these updated
Terms and to continue enjoying our products and services. Press * to
view these updated Terms.” A large button reading “Agree” follows. The
pop-up doesn’t offer a way to disagree, and users are unable to use
their device unless they hit agree. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica
The best part of this story? And by best I mean worst? You have to send
a letter – a paper one, with stamps and everything, like in the before
times – to Roku’s lawyer in California containing the names of all the
people opting out, the devices and services in question, and a damn
purchase receipt. They’re one step away from wanting your passport and
your firstborn child.</p>

id="trump-asks-to-delay-hush-money-trial-until-us-supreme-court-reviews-immunity-claim">Trump
Asks to Delay Hush Money Trial Until US Supreme Court Reviews Immunity
Claim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Donald Trump on Monday asked the New York judge overseeing
his criminal case on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn
star to delay the trial until the U.S. Supreme Court finishes reviewing
his claim of presidential immunity in a separate case.</p>
<p>The first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president is set to
begin on March 25 in a New York state court in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsification of
business records.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say he directed his former lawyer and fixer, Michael
Cohen, to pay porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet before the
2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade
earlier, and then falsely recorded his reimbursement to Cohen as legal
expenses.</p>
<p>Trump denies the encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie
Clifford.</p>
<p>The move was the latest by Trump seeking to delay the four upcoming
criminal trials he faces until closer to, or even after, his expected
Nov. 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments April 25, a month
after the scheduled start of jury selection in Trump’s hush money case.
It is the first of his four criminal cases slated to go to trial.</p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty in all criminal cases, which he has
termed “election interference.”</p>
<p>In their court filing on Monday, Trump’s lawyers said the outcome of
the Supreme Court’s review was relevant to the hush money case because
prosecutors were seeking to present evidence of statements Trump made
while he was president.</p>
<p>Last month, prosecutors said they planned to introduce evidence of a
“pressure campaign” by Trump in 2018 to ensure Cohen did not cooperate
with a federal investigation into the payment to Daniels. Cohen pleaded
guilty that year to violating campaign finance law.</p>
<p>In their court filing on Monday, Trump’s lawyers called prosecutors’
claim of a pressure campaign “fictitious.” They said Trump’s social
media posts about Cohen were “official communications” about “matters of
public concern” and thus immune from state prosecution.</p>
<p>“Without immunity from criminal prosecution based on official acts,
the President’s political opponents will seek to influence and control
his or her decisions via de facto extortion,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which
brought the charges, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Last year, Trump made a similar argument as part of an unsuccessful
push to move the hush money case from state court to federal court. In
denying Trump’s request in July 2023, U.S. District Judge Alvin
Hellerstein wrote that the payment to Daniels “was a purely personal
item.”</p>
<p>“Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a
President’s official acts,” Hellerstein wrote.</p>

id="former-trump-aide-navarro-ordered-to-report-to-us-prison-this-month">Former
Trump Aide Navarro Ordered to Report to US Prison This Month</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Ex-Donald Trump adviser Peter Navarro has been ordered
to report to prison this month, his lawyers said in a court filing,
which could make him the first senior member of the former president’s
administration to do so for efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat. </p>
<p>Navarro, who served as Trump’s trade adviser, is due on March 19 to
begin his four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the U.S. House
of Representatives committee that investigated the January 6, 2021,
Capitol attack, his lawyers revealed in a court filing late Sunday. </p>
<p>They are asking a federal appeals court in Washington to pause the
sentence while Navarro appeals his conviction. His defense team
indicated they would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene if his
request is denied. </p>
<p>Navarro, 74, was found guilty of contempt of Congress last September
for refusing to turn over documents or sit for an interview with the
Democratic-led House committee that investigated the Capitol riot, a
failed attempt by Trump supporters to overturn Trump’s defeat in the
2020 election. He was sentenced in January. </p>
<p>Navarro, a China hawk who also advised Trump on the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, has claimed Trump invoked the legal doctrine of
executive privilege, which shields some presidential records and
communications from disclosure.  </p>
<p>A federal judge found that Trump had not formerly invoked the
privilege. </p>
<p>Steve Bannon, a one-time top strategist to Trump, was also sentenced
to four months in prison for defying a subpoena from the January 6
panel, but a judge has allowed him to remain free while he appeals.</p>

<h2 id="un-chief-fears-global-rollback-in-womens-rights">UN Chief Fears
Global Rollback in Women’s Rights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>United Nations — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday
that women and girls around the world are suffering a rollback in
rights, while millions more are bearing the brunt of wars and
conflict.  </p>
<p>“Hard-fought progress is being reversed,” Guterres told hundreds of
women’s rights advocates, officials and activists at the opening of the
annual two-week session of the Commission on the Status of Women at U.N.
headquarters in New York.  </p>
<p>He said women’s rights are essentially a question of power and he is
worried by negative trends.  </p>
<p>“First, despite enormous progress that all of you have helped realize
– the patriarchy is far from vanquished. It is regaining ground,” said
the secretary-general. “Autocrats and populists are attacking women’s
freedoms and their sexual and reproductive rights. They promote what
they call ‘traditional’ values.”  </p>
<p>He said discrimination against women goes back thousands of years and
it is not something that should be brought back, it should be turned
back.  </p>
<p>“We cannot accept a world in which grandmothers fear their
granddaughters will enjoy fewer rights than they had,” he said. “We must
speak out, loud and clear: Not on our watch.” </p>
<p>Female poverty  </p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, delegates will review how to speed up
achieving gender equality, with a focus on addressing poverty and
investing in women and girls. U.N. Women says more than 100 million
women and girls could be lifted out of poverty if governments prioritize
education and family planning, fair and equal pay, and expanded social
benefits. </p>
<p>The U.N. chief told the meeting that “poverty has a female face,”
because women have less access to land, natural resources and other
financial assets. They earn just 51 cents for every dollar men earn, and
they are more likely to be food insecure. The U.N. says more than 10% of
the world’s women are living in extreme poverty – on less than $2.15 a
day. </p>
<p>“Today, one in 10 women lives in extreme poverty. And at the current
rate of progress, as many as 342 million women will still be living in
poverty in or by 2030,” said Sima Bahous, the executive director of U.N.
Women. “This makes a mockery of our 2030 [development] agenda.” </p>
<p>Women also suffer more when it comes to conflict. The U.N. chief
noted that more than two-thirds of the people killed and injured in
Israel’s military operations in Gaza are reportedly women and
children.</p>
<p>“Families seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment are struggling to
survive, as hunger and malnutrition take hold. This is heartbreaking and
utterly unacceptable,” he said of the war against Hamas. “Once again, I
call for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the unconditional release of
all hostages, and a massive increase in humanitarian aid.”</p>
<p>He also repeated an appeal for a cease-fire in Sudan, where thousands
have been killed in 11 months of fighting between rival generals, and
rape has widely been used as weapon of war.</p>

<h2 id="biden-calls-for-7.3-trillion-us-budget-for-fiscal-2025">Biden
Calls for $7.3 Trillion US Budget for Fiscal 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — U.S. President Joe Biden laid out his 2025
government spending priorities on Monday in a $7.3 trillion plan that
has little chance of being enacted by the politically divided
Congress. </p>
<p>Biden touted the proposal as he traveled to New Hampshire to sell
Americans on his plan to increase taxes on the wealthy and to highlight
his values and priorities to woo voters in a key swing state.  </p>
<p>During a visit to Goffstown, Biden pulled a line from last week’s
State of the Union address to show how he is different from his main
rival, former President Donald Trump. Speaking Monday at the YMCA, at a
charity-run community center, he kicked a particularly sensitive
political football once again — health care and pensions for the
elderly.  </p>
<p>“Even this morning, Donald Trump said cuts to Social Security and
Medicare are on the table again,” he said, adding, “I’m never going to
allow that to happen.” </p>
<p>Biden’s budget for the fiscal year starting October 1 calls for a
liberal wish list of policies favored by many Democrats — sharply higher
taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals and more assistance for
low- and middle-income earners to help them pay for high housing and
child care costs.  </p>
<p>The president’s plan would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to
28%, impose a rate increase on individuals earning more than $400,000 a
year, and force those with more than $100 million in wealth to pay at
least a 25% income tax.  </p>
<p>“I’m a capitalist, man,” Biden said Monday in New Hampshire. “Make
all the money you want — just begin to pay your fair share of
taxes.” </p>
<p>At the same time, Biden wants to increase the government’s authority
to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drug
prices. In the United States, people who need to fill medical
prescriptions often pay more for their pills than patients in other
countries for the same medications. He also called for reinstating a
child tax credit for low- and middle-income earners that has
lapsed.   </p>
<p>White House budget officials say the spending proposal would cut the
government’s chronic annual deficit spending by $3 trillion over the
next decade, slowing but not halting the growth of the burgeoning
national debt that has reached $34.5 trillion.  </p>
<p>The budget, said Shalanda Young, director of the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget, has a stated goal of “lowering costs for families
growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, by investing in
all America to make sure the middle class has a fair shot. And we leave
no one behind,” she told reporters on a Monday morning call.   </p>
<p>The largest item in the national budget is defense. But defense
officials say the numbers aren’t as big as they sound, with a senior
defense official telling reporters during the budget rollout process
that it “is not enough of an increase to cover inflation.” </p>
<p>Consumer advocates disagree with that characterization. Lisa Gilbert,
executive vice president of Public Citizen, argues that priorities are
misplaced.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon “is a three-quarters-of-a-trillion-dollar agency that
has never once passed an audit. It’s infamous for waste, fraud and
bankrolling defense corporations,” Gilbert said. </p>
<p>“It’s impossible not to comment on the $895 billion defense top
line,” she said. “War hawks squealing that a 1% increase to defense
spending is ‘meager’ or ‘catastrophic’ lack perspective altogether. The
true catastrophe is the existing scale of U.S. military spending.” </p>
<p>Biden again called for funding tighter immigration controls at the
U.S.-Mexico border and more aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Funding
for the border restrictions and foreign assistance is currently stalled
in a lengthy congressional debate over how tough the migration
restrictions should be and to what extent the U.S. should continue to
fund Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s two-year invasion.  </p>
<p>Biden’s budget proposal echoed some of the themes he offered at his
State of the Union address last week.   </p>
<p>“Imagine a future with affordable child care. … Imagine a future with
paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and
taking care of a sick family member. Imagine a future of home care and
elder care and people living with disabilities so they can stay in their
homes, and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve.” </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Biden ally, also highlighted
the difference between Biden’s vision and Trump’s in a statement about
the budget proposal. Lawmakers in this deeply divided Congress are
responsible for passing the annual budget.  </p>
<p>“The contrast couldn’t be starker, and the stakes couldn’t be
higher,” said Whitehouse, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “I
look forward to working with the White House and Democrats in Congress
to make the President’s vision a reality.” </p>
<p>That contrast has turned off Republicans, who on Monday panned
Biden’s budget for its “reckless spending.”  </p>
<p>Republicans traditionally favor tax reductions and lower government
spending — as House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve
Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and Republican conference chair Elise
Stefanik noted in a joint statement on Monday.  </p>
<p>“Biden’s budget doesn’t just miss the mark — it is a road map to
accelerate America’s decline,” they said. “While hardworking Americans
struggle with crushing inflation and mounting national debt, the
President would increase their pain to spend trillions of additional
taxpayer dollars to advance his left-wing agenda.” </p>
<p>The political disputes this year have been even more protracted than
usual, with spending levels not yet set for more than half the
government for the 2024 fiscal year that started October 1. Just last
week, Congress approved funding for not quite half the government
agencies and is facing a March 22 deadline to set spending levels for
the rest.  </p>
<p>Last Thursday, Republicans in the House of Representatives issued a
plan to balance the federal budget within the next 10 years by cutting
$14 trillion in federal spending, including two Biden favorites — green
energy subsidies and student loan forgiveness. </p>
<p>The White House called the plan unworkable.  </p>
<p>Trump, virtually assured of the Republican presidential nomination to
face Biden again after losing to him in 2020, offered some of his
economic proposals Monday in an interview on CNBC.  </p>
<p>He called for his 2017 tax cuts that greatly benefited wealthy wage
earners to be extended beyond their scheduled 2025 expiration
date.    </p>
<p>“I think taxes could be cut. I think other things could happen to
more than adjust that. But I’m a big believer in tariffs,” Trump
said.  </p>
<p>He said the imposition of new tariffs on imports helps American
businesses when they are “being taken advantage of” by China and other
nations.  </p>
<p>“Beyond the economics, it gives you power in dealing with other
countries,” Trump said. </p>
<p>He said he was not concerned about any possible retaliatory tariffs
from other countries.  </p>
<p>Democrats generally say the higher tariffs that Trump advocates hurt
consumers, because companies importing foreign goods often add the
tariff costs to the cost of consumer goods sold in the U.S.   </p>
<p>On bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, Trump said he has “seen that
there has been a lot of use of that. And I’m not sure that I’d want to
take it away.”</p>

<p>Unlikely to pass the House and the Senate to become law, the proposal
for fiscal 2025 is an election year blueprint about what the future
could hold if Biden and enough of his fellow Democrats win in November.
The president and his aides previewed parts of his budget going into
last week’s State of the Union address, and they provided the fine print
on Monday.</p>

<p>Journalism talks about Trump’s trials, but they are trials for the
Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he
is</a>) then if he isn’t punished we no longer have the rule of law. So
don’t miss that we are on trial too. And – when journalism frames the
faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the
United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the
Republicans win. We know that, it’s provable. And anything that’s true
should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</p>

id="sen.-bob-menendez-enters-not-guilty-plea-to-latest-criminal-indictment">Sen. Bob
Menendez Enters Not Guilty Plea to Latest Criminal Indictment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife pleaded not guilty on
Monday to new obstruction of justice charges in a New York court.</p>
<p>The new charges were in a rewritten indictment returned last week
against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>“Once again, not guilty your honor,” Menendez responded after Judge
Sidney H. Stein asked him to enter a plea at a 20-minute hearing.
Menendez had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in October.</p>
<p>Menendez and his wife, Nadine, entered the pleas to the indictment
containing new charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction
of justice. Afterward, they briefly spoke to one another before leaving
the courtroom together.</p>
<p>The couple is charged with conspiring with three businessmen to
accept bribes of gold bars, cash and a luxury car in return for the
senator’s help in projects pursued by the businessmen.</p>
<p>Two of the three businessmen they allegedly conspired with also
entered not guilty pleas on Monday. A third, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty
two weeks ago to bribery charges and agreed to testify against the
others at a trial set for May 6.</p>
<p>The new allegations — part of what is now an 18-count indictment —
are related to gifts prosecutors say the couple received from Uribe.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Menendez caused his lawyer to falsely
tell prosecutors overseeing the investigation that he was unaware that
another of his business associates had helped his wife make a $23,000
mortgage payment on her New Jersey home. It said Nadine Menendez caused
her lawyer to tell prosecutors last August that the mortgage payment and
funds provided by Uribe for a Mercedes-Benz were loans when she knew
they were bribes.</p>
<p>Menendez said in a statement last week that prosecutors have “long
known that I learned of and helped repay loans — not bribes — that had
been provided to my wife.”</p>
<p>After his fall arrest, Menendez, 70, was forced to relinquish his
chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would

In collaboration with the other major browser engine developers, Mozilla
is thrilled to announce Speedometer 3 today. Like previous versions of
Speedometer, this benchmark measures what we think matters most for
performance online: responsiveness. But today’s release is more open and
more challenging than before, and is the best tool for driving browser
performance improvements that we’ve ever seen.

that owns it, ByteDance, doesn’t sell off the social media platform.
That effort has rare bipartisan support. We’ll unpack the latest. Later:
what to make of some firmer-than-expected inflation readings and how the
marching band at Prairie View A&amp;M is helping students’ career
prospects.

<h2 id="better-faster-stronger-time-zone-updates-on-android">Better,
faster, stronger time zone updates on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline,
called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to
react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before.
However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline
changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower
deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline’s
infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other
components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond
rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to
Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally,
this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of
Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct
time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring
and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into
making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large
chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.</p>

<h2 id="oh-servers">Oh servers!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server
software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging
communities.
</p>
<p>
And then this happened…
</p>
<p>
We’ve been having serious problems on
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I
made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash
when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you’d get an awful error
message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the
server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and
restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some
work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors.
And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they
still haven’t.
</p>
<p>
We’re going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to
the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to
its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we’re going to upgrade
the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That
won’t happen today and probably not tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Most people probably don’t know that feedland.com is a project I’m doing
with Automattic. It’s running in their cloud. This system should be able
to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can’t, where
feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are
many thousands of users, we should be okay. That’s why I did the work to
convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and
nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last
year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but
it had to be done.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on
our main server in the last few days. I can’t promise it won’t happen
again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases
re-learned.
</p>
<p>
It’s even worse than it appears and as they say – still diggin!

the Environmental Protection Agency over its sweeping methane rules that
target oil and gas operations. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that
is 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide, and oil and gas sites are
a key source of man-made methane emissions. The EPA regulations,
announced late last year, ban polluting practices like routine flaring
of natural gas from new wells, require wells to be regularly monitored
for leaks, and phase out some old and leaky infrastructure. As<em>

Emily Pontecorvo reported</a>, the EPA says the rules will prevent the
equivalent of 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted
between 2024 and 2038, almost as much as was emitted by all power plants
in the country in 2021. Texas is the largest oil-producing state in the
U.S. It challenged the rules late on Friday, accusing the EPA of
“overreach.”

<li>Analysis shows Europe is woefully unprepared for climate change
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Europe is the fastest-warming continent on Earth,
heating at twice the global rate, but is underprepared for the
“catastrophic” risks posed by climate change, according to an
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ffc4109111&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessment
from the European Union Environment Agency</a>. The group considered 36
major climate risks, including ecosystem collapse, drought, and extreme
heat, and concluded that unless preparations are made, hundreds of
thousands of people could die from heat waves, and coastal floods could
cost 1 trillion euros per year. The EEA warned that policymakers need to
do more to shore up critical infrastructure, agriculture, and healthcare
systems to prepare for extreme weather before it’s too late. “Our new
analysis shows that Europe faces urgent climate risks that are growing
faster than our societal preparedness,”

<li>Low-voltage batteries failing in some EVs
</h3>
<p>
<strong> </strong>Some new electric vehicles are experiencing repeated
problems with their 12-volt batteries,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a2a90ea2a2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a><em>
The Wall Street Journal.</em> These are the low-voltage batteries that
have been found under the hoods of most cars for years. They power
things like interior lights and electronics, and seem to be dying
quickly in some brand new EVs, including models from Cadillac, Hyundai,
and Rivian. “The 12-volt battery is in many ways a dated technology for
cars on the road today, which are becoming more like computers on wheels
and have greater power needs,” Ryan Felton reported for the
<em>Journal</em>. “But switching to a higher-voltage system is also
difficult because it would essentially mean wholesale changes to the
supply chain for these parts.” Tesla’s Cybertruck has already moved to a
48-volt system, and the company’s director called it “the future for low
voltage design at Tesla and likely the rest of the industry in due
course.”

<li>Musk Foundation is ‘largely self-serving,’ according to NYT

<p>
<strong></strong>A <em>New York Times</em>

calls into question the integrity of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s charity, the
Musk Foundation, accusing it of failing to give away the minimum amount
of money to justify hefty tax breaks, and being “haphazard and largely
self-serving.” The Musk Foundation has a history of donating millions
less than is required by tax law, and the <em>Times</em> found that
about half of its donations between 2021 and 2022 were linked to Musk in
some way, including a food charity run by his brother and a school where
Musk’s own children attended. “The really striking thing about Musk is
the disjuncture between his outsized public persona, and his very, very
minimal philanthropic presence,” said Benjamin Soskis, who studies
philanthropy at the Urban Institute.

<li>Seedlings from famous Sycamore Gap tree begin to sprout
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Seedlings from England’s famous Sycamore Gap tree,
which was felled by vandals last year, have sprouted. Conservation
experts collected seeds and cuttings from the 300-year-old tree before
it was removed from its home along Hadrian’s Wall and brought them to
the National Trust’s conservation center with hopes of cultivating them
and perhaps planting a new tree in the same location. The first
seedlings began to sprout at the start of 2024. The conservation center
is in a secret location in London. It houses genetic copies of important
plants including the apple tree said to have inspired Sir Isaac Newton’s
theory of gravity, and a tree where Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn,

to</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. “while there’s a way to go before we have
true saplings, we’ll be keeping everything crossed that these plants
continue to grow stronger and can be planted out and enjoyed by many in
the future,” said Andrew Jasper, Director of Gardens and Parklands at
the National Trust.

Consumer trust in Boeing is wearing thin since an airplane door ripped

recent Boeing safety incidents. So how much does faltering trust
actually impact the business of air travel? Plus, President Joe Biden

Federal Reserve Needs to Get Serious About Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY5MjU1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTY0NzU2M30.MemCp_vvKtIEpnCpVAOmmxRjboCUavb624J94ULUY4w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
People <em style="">really</em> hate inflation. Fortunately, prices are
no longer rising nearly as rapidly as they were in 2021 and 2022.
However, we may be on the cusp of a longer epoch of periodic inflation
caused by climate change, one of the biggest long-term threats to price
stability. The Federal Reserve should act accordingly. <br/>
</p>
<p>
America’s central bank has a dual mandate: It calibrates monetary policy
to maximize employment while minimizing inflation. With
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1hVzK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unemployment</a>
reaching record lows, the Fed has been focused on controlling the spike
in inflation we saw from 2021-2022. It quickly raised interest rates
over the last two years in order to cool the economy and put downward
pressure on prices. And voila, after peaking in the summer of 2022,
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflation</a>
has steadily fallen to manageable levels.
</p>
<p>
However, the Fed’s rate hikes may not have been the primary driver
behind disinflation. Inflation, it’s often said, occurs when there’s too
much money chasing too few goods. The Fed’s higher-interest rate policy
primarily hit the <em>too much money</em> side of the ledger, decreasing
demand by making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow.
But there’s mounting evidence that the bigger macro-economic problem was
<em>too few goods</em>. The Roosevelt Institute did a
<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/supply-side-expansion-has-driven-the-decline-in-inflation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">close
analysis</a> of inflation’s decline since 2022, and found that prices of
goods have fallen even while demand has increased. That suggests that
most of the decline in inflation has been from increased supply — that
is, inflation was cured by recovering from pandemic-era supply chain
bottlenecks. Supply chains that got snarled by COVID-19 production
shutdowns and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine slowly sorted themselves out;
as more goods came on to the market, prices eventually stabilized.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s own data found that supply chain pressure
closely tracked inflation. Researchers at the San Francisco Fed
<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2023/06/global-supply-chain-pressures-and-us-inflation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that supply chain issues account for 60 percent of inflation in 2021 and
2022.
</p>
<p>
In order to prevent future inflation flare-ups, we must guard against
other foreseeable supply chain shocks. The pandemic may have been a
once-in-a-lifetime (let’s hope) calamity, but it won’t be the last
supply pileup. Climate change is also expected to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/business/economy/climate-change-supply-chain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wreak
havoc</a> on the global movement of goods. As the planet warms,
droughts, floods, and other extreme weather will
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58073295" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">become</a>
more frequent and more severe. That will lead to a rise in the magnitude
and frequency of supply-chain disruptions as factories are evacuated or
shipping routes become untraversable.
</p>
<p>
For example, in August 2022, Chinese factories were
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/business/economy/climate-change-supply-chain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a>
not due to the pandemic, but because of a brutal drought. These closures
in turn froze international supply chains for cars, electronics and
other goods. Significant waterways for international trade, like the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/business/economy/panama-canal-drought-shipping.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Panama
Canal</a> and the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/river-freight-climate-economies" target="_blank">Rhine</a>,
have seen their water levels periodically dry up so much that shipping
vessels cannot pass through, halting the shipment of goods.
</p>
<p>
We’ll see more of this as warming worsens. As the White House Council of
Economic Advisers
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ERP-2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>,
“As [supply-chain] networks become more connected, and climate change
worsens, the frequency and size of supply-chain-related disasters
rises.” The CEA found that over the last 40 years, the frequency of
natural disasters around the world has tripled, and the number of
billion-dollar disasters each year has risen from five to 20.
</p>
<p>
Food prices are among the most visible — and painful — forms of
inflation for consumers. And we’ve seen climate-related weather events
drive up food prices in the past. As the U.S. Department of Agriculture
recalled in its
<a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/USDAAgriFoodSupplyChainReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022
supply chain report</a>, a severe years-long drought in the southern
plains states in the early 2010s dramatically culled the population of
beef cows and caused historically high beef prices. And global
<a href="https://grist.org/agriculture/heatflation-how-hot-temperatures-drive-inflation-food-prices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heat
waves</a> in recent years have sent the cost of staple crops soaring.
</p>
<p>
While some amount of warming is locked in at this point, doing all we
can to cut emissions as quickly as possible will help minimize future
supply chain disruptions. That requires building massive amounts of new
clean energy infrastructure. In 2022, the federal government passed
major climate legislation as part of the Inflation Reduction Act to
offer hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to encourage the
development of wind farms, solar arrays, and other clean energy sources,
as well as financial incentives for consumers to purchase electric
vehicles, heat pumps, and other clean-energy home upgrades.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the passage of the IRA has coincided with the Fed’s
generationally-high interest rate policy. High interest rates have made
it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/climate/renewable-energy-inflation-climate-cop28.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much
more costly</a> to build renewable energy projects in the U.S. and
around the world — especially expensive projects like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">offshore
wind farms,</a> which have seen multiple cancellations and delays due to
higher-than-anticipated financing costs. High rates are also a heavier
drag on renewable energy projects than fossil fuel projects because the
bulk of the costs for a wind or solar farm are in upfront construction.
</p>
<p>
The Fed expects to begin gradually cutting interest rates over the
coming year if inflation continues to cool. That would ease borrowing
costs throughout the economy, which will help more clean energy projects
get built and make EVs more affordable to more buyers. That’s a win-win:
A swift pivot to a clean-energy economy will reduce emissions, which
will also mitigate future weather-related supply chain shocks. And that
will make it easier for the Fed to fulfill its mandate to manage
inflation in the future: Lower interest rates now will help support
rapid decarbonization, which in turn will reduce climate-induced
inflation down the road.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say that the central bank needs to morph into a “Green
Fed.”
</p>
<p>
“The Federal Reserve is not and will not be a ‘climate policymaker,’”
Chairman Jerome Powell
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/powell-statement-20231024b.htm" target="_blank">said</a>
in October, when the Fed and other agencies unveiled guidance for how
banks should manage climate-related financial risk. “Decisions about
policies to address climate change must be made by the elected branches
of government.”
</p>
<p>
The Fed takes a thousand-foot view of the economy, and can’t set rates
based on the needs of any one industry, no matter how important. But as
climate change reshapes the world around us, all institutions will feel
its effects, including the Fed. While environmental goals won’t drive
Fed policy, managing long-term inflation will mean paying attention to
how the bank’s actions affect the climate. Just as the Fed monitors how
interest rate policy affects key sectors like the housing market, it
should also pay increasing attention to how it affects the clean-energy
sector.
</p>
<p>
When the Inflation Reduction Act passed, the law’s name drew some scorn
as a supposed misnomer for what was fundamentally a climate bill. But
over the long haul, combating climate change <em style="">is</em> a big
part of what we need to do to ward off inflation. If we fall short, then
missed decarbonization opportunities today will increase the threat of
extreme-weather supply-chain bottlenecks tomorrow. And that means more
inflation. Even if it’s not a “climate policymaker,” the Fed will come
to care about climate change.The only question is whether that happens
years from now, when climate inflation arrives in earnest, or now, when
we still have a chance to do something about it.

During my PhD I have focused on Environment Generation/ Curriculum Learning methods for training Autonomous Agents with Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, I work on methods that algorithmically generates diverse training environments (i.e., learning scenarios) for autonomous agents to improve generalization and sample efficiency. Currently, I am working on Large Language Model (LLM) based autonomous agents.&lt;br /&gt;

          &lt;strong&gt;Research Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt; My research delves into the theoretical aspects of deep implicit models, beginning with a unified &quot;state-space&quot; representation that simplifies notation. Additionally, my work explores various training challenges associated with deep learning, including problems amenable to convex and non-convex optimization. In addition to theoretical exploration, my research extends the potential applications to various problem domains, including natural language processing, and natural science.&lt;br /&gt;

I leverage my background in Mechanical Engineering to discover how machine learning and model-based optimal control can create safe, high-performance control systems for robotics and autonomous systems. A particular emphasis of mine has been how to leverage offline datasets (e.g. human player&#39;s racing trajectories) to inform better, more sample efficient control algorithms.&lt;br /&gt;

<h2 id="why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">
2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?
</h1>
<p>
The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined
audience. It is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It’s more
than writing into a booklet, “Dear Diary, …” – and yet we do it even if
there are no comments. Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think
I’m just as happy getting the occasional email or reply on the
fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the words is terrifying. And
once I got that first comment, once I started linking the blog from my
profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to
read and implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was
something I feared. The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart
beats. The heart bleeds.
</p>
<p>
Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments.
First, there’s a comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk
a look? But then the imagined audience is still there and now it’s
worse. How will I react as I am being watched? Blogging turns into a
performance where I feel like I’m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am
I? All the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really don’t
want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren’t very observant being unable to perceive
their own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously.
Words are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to
weight them carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It
doesn’t matter how long or how short the page, how trivial or how
controversial the topic.
</p>
<p>
And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts
unexamined and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the
judgements. How often have I found myself falling short of my own
measure.
</p>
<p>
To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for
me, for my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I
struggle for virtue and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined
reader and myself. As proof. “I struggled!” I struggle. I keep on
struggling to discover what is right and to do what is right.
</p>
<p>
Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things
that I think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my
mind. I write about the things I know because I did not know them
before. And who cares about those laborious system administration blog
posts where I struggle with this or that ephemeral problem. All these
issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People find their answers on Stack
Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized platform where middlemen
gamify the experience so that we can help each other while on the
thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I
do, when I’m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And
there are so many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved
articles and snippets are more like compost heaps, where layer upon
layer of good stuff gets dropped, never to see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a
fire, somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that
is fine. The world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one
thought knows not the next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion
of the sleepless mind. Our books, our journals, our blogs, our posts,
they all participate. Perhaps we fall for those waves of outrage and the
galaxy brain has a seizure as we all throw our weight around in unison,
crushing innocent lives, leaving those we hurt behind, forgetting them
as quickly as we forget about the outrage.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one
sparking a fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and
posts on social media has certainly changed me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and
blogging. And this is why I cannot stop blogging. To blog in that
half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and perhaps they are
not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks onto that
great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of
us can talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to
blog.
</p>
<p>
I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to
think long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing.
I keep failing and so I must keep blogging.

<p>
That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my
posts. The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on
that, too, by the same author:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one. The
ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I’m
sure I’ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost
entirely unsupportable to me now. And yet: Nothing else has quite the
same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of. The
one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of
things.

<p>
The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.

<p>
<strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where
you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away. Not worth
the electrons it was written with! But who’s doing the judging: you, or
that imagined audience I was talking about?
</p>
<p>
I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening
audience. And really, who is going to read my blog? Internet
stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my
parents. (Hi mom!) I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I’m
feeling anxious. Because writing in a paper notebook I don’t feel
judged. Surely there’s a similar place, online. The key is to find that
happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the
Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging
nightmare might be.
</p>
<p>
For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right.
Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit. All these sites
are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden,
Zettelkasten, there’s not enough difference to draw lines. It’s all a
question of intent, of culture, of belonging. The blog spirit is to
write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive. The digital
garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined
or not. The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you
thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to
more thoughts on new notes. And the wiki spirit is to write and edit
online, to hit the Save button and then it’s live. There is no editor,
there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management. I can
see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old
web power. It’s not an app. The software has no idea of process. The
wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save. And
then I read it again, and edit it. And tomorrow, I read it again, and
edit it. And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.
</p>
<p>
I no longer live in the
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages
are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add
timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do
disappear into the great compost of thoughts. The archive gobbles them
up. I do go back but I don’t rewrite the pages completely. I’m more
likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this
page.
</p>
<p>
I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don’t like at all. I do leave
some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad
opinions held.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren’t gems. They
are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not
job applications. And if I don’t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise
it. Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret
something, or I add something. I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I
add new pages. What I don’t do is polish the old posts. There will be
more great posts in the future. The important part is the writing.

<strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading
<a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in

meaning is discussed.

<p>
Meaning without an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is …
generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking,
or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a
more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a
feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better
about life, or change those feelings somehow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then with an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in
important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were
clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in
so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the
structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.

<p>
I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it
again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two
“views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.
</p>
<p>
A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page
lists all the pages in the order of their creation.
</p>
<p>
A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a>
page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).
</p>
<p>
So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed:
<a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki
feed</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed.
But it’s there for you.

id="oppenheimer-wins-best-picture-at-academy-awards-emma-stone-takes-best-actress">‘Oppenheimer’
Wins Best Picture at Academy Awards, Emma Stone Takes Best Actress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — “Oppenheimer,” a solemn three-hour biopic that became
an unlikely billion-dollar box-office sensation, was crowned best
picture at a 96th Academy Awards that doubled as a coronation for
Christopher Nolan.</p>
<p>After passing over arguably Hollywood’s foremost big-screen auteur
for years, the Oscars made up for lost time by heaping seven awards on
Nolan’s blockbuster biopic, including best actor for Cillian Murphy,
best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and best director for
Nolan.</p>
<p>In anointing “Oppenheimer,” the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and
Sciences did something it hasn’t done for more than a decade: hand its
top prize to a widely seen, big-budget studio film. In a film industry
where a cape, dinosaur or Tom Cruise has often been a requirement for
such box office, “Oppenheimer” brought droves of moviegoers to theaters
with a complex, fission-filled drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the
creation of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>“For better or worse, we’re all living in Robert Oppenheimer’s
world,” said Murphy in his acceptance speech. “I’d like to dedicate this
to the peacemakers.”</p>
<p>As a film heavy with unease for human capacity for mass destruction,
“Oppenheimer” also emerged – even over its partner in cultural
phenomenon, “Barbie” – as a fittingly foreboding film for times rife
with cataclysm, man-made or not. Sunday’s Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in
Los Angeles unfolded against the backdrop of wars in Gaza and Ukraine,
and with a potentially momentous U.S. election on the horizon.</p>
<p>The most closely watched contest of the Academy Awards went to Emma
Stone, who won best best actress for her performance as Bella Baxter in
“Poor Things.”</p>
<p>In what was seen as the night’s most nail-biting category, Stone won
over Lily Gladstone of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone would
have become the first Native American to win an Academy Award.</p>
<p>Instead, Oscar voters couldn’t resist the full-bodied extremes of
Stone’s “Poor Things” performance. The win for Stone, her second best
actress Oscar following her 2019 win for “La La Land,” confirmed the
35-year-old as arguably the preeminent big-screen actress of her
generation. The list of women to win best actress two or more times is
illustrious, including Katherine Hepburn, Frances McDormand, Ingrid
Bergman and Bette Davis.</p>
<p>“Oh, boy, this is really overwhelming,” said Stone.</p>
<p>Nolan has had many movies in the Oscar mix before, including
“Inception,” “Dunkirk” and “The Dark Knight.” But his win Sunday for
direction is the first Academy Award for the 53-year-old filmmaker.</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech, Nolan noted cinema is just over a hundred
years old.</p>
<p>“We don’t know where this incredible journey is going from here,”
said Nolan. “But to think that I’m a meaningful part of it means the
world to me.”</p>
<p>Protest and politics intruded on an election-year Academy Awards on
Sunday, where demonstrations for Gaza raged outside the Dolby Theatre in
Los Angeles, and awards went to “Oppenheimer,” “The Zone of Interest”
and “20 Days in Mariupol.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s broadcast, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, had plenty of razzle
dazzle, including a sprawling song-and-dance rendition of the “Barbie”
hit “I’m Just Ken” by Ryan Gosling, with an assist on guitar by Slash. A
sea of Kens swarmed the stage.</p>
<p>The lead winner, as expected was “Oppenheimer,” the blockbuster
biopic. Though not quite the clean sweep that some expected,
“Oppenheimer” was overpowering all competition — including its
release-date companion, “Barbie” — winning awards for its
cinematography, editing, score and Robert Downey Jr.’s supporting
performance.</p>
<p>Downey, nominated twice before (for “Chaplin” and “Tropic Thunder”),
notched his first Oscar, crowning the illustrious second act of his
up-and-down career.</p>
<p>“I’d like to thank my terrible childhood and the academy, in that
order,” said Downey, the son of filmmaker Robert Downey Sr.</p>
<p>“Barbie,” last year’s biggest box-office hit with more than $1.4
billion in ticket sales, didn’t win an award until almost three hours
into the ceremony. It won best song (sorry, Ken) for Billie Eilish and
Finneas’ “What Was I Made For?” It’s their second Oscar, two years after
winning for their James Bond theme, “No Time to Die.”</p>
<p>But after an awards season that stayed largely inside a Hollywood
bubble, geopolitics played a prominent role. Protests over Israel’s war
in Gaza snarled traffic around the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, slowing
stars’ arrival on the red carpet and turning the Oscar spotlight toward
the ongoing conflict. Some protesters shouted “Shame!” at those trying
to reach the awards.</p>
<p>Jonathan Glazer, the British filmmaker whose chilling Auschwitz drama
“The Zone of Interest” won best international film, drew connections
between the dehumanization depicted in his film and today.</p>
<p>“Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the
Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for
so many innocent people, whether the victims of October the 7th in
Israel, or the the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims, this
dehumanization, how do we resist?”</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was on the minds of many attendees, as was the war in
Ukraine. A year after “Navalny” won the same award, Mstyslav Chernov’s
“20 Days in Mariupol,” a harrowing chronicle of the early days of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, won best documentary. The win, a first for
The Associated Press and PBS’ “Frontline,” came as the war in Ukraine
passed the two-year mark with no signs of abating.</p>
<p>Mstyslav Chernov, the Ukrainian filmmaker and AP journalist whose
hometown was bombed the day he learned of his Oscar nomination, spoke
forcefully about Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“This is the first Oscar in Ukrainian history,” said Chernov. “And
I’m honored. Probably I will be the first director on this stage to say
I wish I’d never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this
(for) Russia never attacking Ukraine.”</p>
<p>In the early going, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein-riff “Poor Things”
ran away with three prizes for its sumptuous craft, including awards for
production design, makeup and hairstyling and costume design.</p>
<p>Kimmel, hosting the ABC telecast for the fourth time, opened the
awards with a monologue that drew a few cold looks (from Downey, Sandra
Hüller and Messi, the dog from best-picture nominee “Anatomy of a
Fall”). But Kimmel, emphasizing Hollywood as “a union town” following
2023’s actor and writer strikes, drew a standing ovation for bringing
out teamsters and behind-the-scenes workers — who are now entering their
own labor negotiations.</p>
<p>The night’s first award was one of its most predictable: Da’Vine Joy
Randolph for best supporting actress, for her performance in Alexander
Payne’s “The Holdovers.” An emotional Randolph was accompanied to the
stage by her “Holdovers” co-star Paul Giamatti.</p>
<p>“For so long I’ve always wanted to be different,” said Randolph. “And
now I realize I just need to be myself.”</p>
<p>Though Randolph’s win was widely expected, an upset quickly followed.
Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won for best animated feature,
a surprise over the slightly favored “Spider-Man: Across the
Spider-Verse.” Miyazaki, the 83-year-old Japanese anime master who came
out of retirement to make “The Boy and the Heron,” didn’t attend the
ceremony. He also didn’t attend the 2003 Oscars when his “Spirited Away”
won the same award.</p>
<p>Best original screenplay went to “Anatomy of a Fall,” which, like
“Barbie,” was penned by a couple: director Justine Triet and Arthur
Harari. “This will help me through my midlife crisis, I think,” said
Triet.</p>
<p>In adapted screenplay, where “Barbie” was nominated — and where some
suspected Greta Gerwig would win after being overlooked for director —
the Oscar went to Cord Jefferson, who wrote and directed his feature
film debut “American Fiction.” He pleaded for executives to take risks
on young filmmakers like himself.</p>
<p>“Instead of making a $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million
movies,” said Jefferson, previously an award-winning TV writer.</p>
<p>The Oscars belonged largely to theatrical-first films. Though it came
into the awards with 19 nominations, Netflix was a bit player. Its lone
win came for live action short: Wes Anderson’s “The Wonderful Story of
Henry Sugar,” based on the story by Roald Dahl.</p>
<p>While “Barbie” bested (and helped lift) “Oppenheimer” at the box
office, it took a back seat to Nolan’s film at the Oscars. Gerwig was
notably overlooked for best director, sparking an outcry that some, even
Hillary Clinton, said mimicked the patriarchy parodied in the film.</p>
