**@Dave Winer's linkblog** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's linkblog)

The problem isn&#39;t that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we&#39;ll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation.

## Design and build the next version of OSNews

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we&#8217;ve had a grand total of 6 designs, and we&#8217;re currently on version 6, introduced about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It&#8217;s now 2024, and for a variety of reasons, we&#8217;re looking to work towards version 7 of our almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea of what I want OSNews 7 to be like &#8211; including mockups. The general goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works. Note that we&#8217;re not looking to change backends or anything like that &#8211; WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology news websites in the world, send me an email.

## TasteFood: Top this easy grilled pizza with summer corn, poblano chiles

date: 2024-07-08, from: San Jose Mercury News

This pizza is inspired by Mexican street corn. It&#8217;s prepared on the grill, which not only keeps the heat outdoors, but lends crucial charred flavor to the crust. Grill the corn ears first to develop their flavor and start the charring process. When fresh corn is in season, the kernels are crisp, juicy and milky-sweet. [&#8230;]

## üìñ A Psalm for the Wild-Built

But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don‚Äôt know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don‚Äôt need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>I tend to read whatever the opposite of cozy science fiction is: angry and worried about the world, building tension from speculative extrapolations of what could go wrong. This, on the other hand, is science fiction that encourages you to just <em>chill</em> for a minute.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know if I could read a lot of this, because I <em>am</em> angry and worried about the world, and reading other peoples‚Äô words along the same lines is cathartic.

Between July 2023 and June 2024, the Earth‚Äôs temperature was 1.64 degrees Celsius (or about 3 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the pre-industrial average.

This is inevitable, unless we stop adding greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the oceans.‚Äù</p><p>Meanwhile, 10% of the country‚Äôs population remains under excessive heat warnings as an extreme heat wave grips states up and down the west coast. ‚ÄúDozens of daily record high temperatures are forecast to be tied or broken into the work week,‚Äù the National Weather Service <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9DlhC9ocEl0RY0ak3hDgIAmDw8S-c7InbnZuGyEhRYKLAzckQOaeLFTcC_0CvlysEfXW6B" target="_blank">said</a>.

Up to 15 inches of rain could fall on the region, and flooding and dangerous storm surge are expected. More than 100,000 customers are already without power. The storm is also affecting oil and gas operations: The state‚Äôs largest ports ‚Äì including Corpus Christi, the top crude oil export hub in the country ‚Äì <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/port-corpus-christi-closes-tropical-storm-beryl-approaches-2024-07-07/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9DlhC9ocEl0RY0ak3hDgIAmDw8S-c7InbnZuGyEhRYKLAzckQOaeLFTcC_0CvlysEfXW6B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halted all cargo operations</a> and some natural gas storage facilities also closed in preparation for the storm.

ESG lawsuit could be an ‚Äòearly harbinger‚Äô of post-Chevron litigation</h3><p>A lawsuit playing out this week in a New Orleans appeals court could be the first test of how courts will treat regulations set by federal agencies after the Supreme Court overturned a 40-year-old precedent, known as the Chevron deference, that deferred to agencies‚Äô interpretations of their own mandates.

Conservatives have argued this amounts to politicizing investment decisions. A Texas judge refused to block the rule in 2022, citing Chevron, but now the landscape looks very different. ‚ÄúThe trial court expressly relying on Chevron in upholding the ESG regulation ... puts this case on track to be an early harbinger of how courts will address pending cases,‚Äù said Julie Stapel, a lawyer with the firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius. The court will begin to hear arguments tomorrow. The fall of Chevron is expected to make it harder for federal agencies to regulate environmental hazards like air and water pollution.</p><h3>4.

The ban came into effect in 2015, and was part of a planning policy that required onshore wind projects to prove local communities did not object to new turbines. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the rule ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù The Labour Party has pledged to double onshore wind energy by 2030 and decarbonize the power sector completely on that same time frame.</p><p>How and when Britain goes green matters on a global scale. ‚ÄúBritain is one of history‚Äôs major climate polluters,‚Äù as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/climate/labor-starmer-election-climate.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9DlhC9ocEl0RY0ak3hDgIAmDw8S-c7InbnZuGyEhRYKLAzckQOaeLFTcC_0CvlysEfXW6B" target="_blank">explained</a>. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases.

## Getting the most out of TWM, X11‚Äôs default window manager

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Graham&#8217;s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and still isn&#8217;t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they published an updated version with even more information, tips, and tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat 1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists &#8211; how many people even know X has a default window manager? &#8211; and even fewer people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream &#8216;Ugh, thats awful!&#8217; and head off to the ports tree or their distro sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment. There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :). ‚Ü´ Graham&#8217;s TWM page I&#8217;ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and didn&#8217;t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend some time with it now, because I&#8217;ve always liked the by-now classic design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions is almost always &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; do we have any TWM users in the audience? I&#8217;m extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at this point, or if, in 2024, it&#8217;s just junk code in the X.org source repository, because I&#8217;m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel a very strong urge to give it a serious go.

## A brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11 and¬†Wayland

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code, protocols, etc. as needed. ‚Ü´ Quod Video The articles describes how to get there using both X and Wayland, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s still quite a bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible, which might not always be the case. For usability&#8217;s sake, there needs to be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next without altering the Z-order.

## Review of prescribed fires finds gaps in key areas as US Forest Service looks to improve safety

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. ‚Äî¬†Two years after the U.S. Forest Service sparked what would become the largest and most destructive wildfire in New Mexico‚Äôs recorded history, independent investigators say there are gaps that need to be addressed if the agency is to be successful at using prescribed fire as a tool to reduce risk amid climate change.¬†¬†


The investigation by the Government Accountability Office was requested by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fern√°ndez after communities in her district were ravaged in 2022 by the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire.¬†¬†


The congresswoman wanted to know what factors the Forest Service had identified as contributing to the escape of prescribed fires over the last decade and whether the agency was following through with reforms promised after a pause and review of its prescribed burn program.¬†¬†


The report made public Monday notes there were 43 escapes documented between 2012 and 2021 out of 50,000 prescribed fire projects. That included blazes in national forests in more than a dozen states, from the California-Nevada border to Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, North Carolina and Arkansas.¬†¬†


With the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies tapping into federal infrastructure and inflation reduction funding to boost the number of prescribed burn operations over the next 10 years, Leger Fern√°ndez said it's more important than ever to ensure they are doing it safely.¬†¬†


The congresswoman was visiting northern New Mexico over recent days, appreciating how things have greened up with summer rains. But the forests are still tinder boxes, she said.¬†¬†


‚ÄúWe need to address our forest, but we need to do it in a responsible way," she told The Associated Press. "When you play with fire, there is no margin for error.‚Äù¬†




¬†


The Forest Service ignites about 4,500 prescribed fires each year, reducing fuels on about 1.3 million acres. It's part of a multi-billion dollar cleanup of forests choked with dead trees and undergrowth.¬†¬†


There have been mixed results as federal land managers have fallen behind on some projects and skipped over some highly at-risk communities to work in less threatened ones, according to a 2023 AP review of data, public records and congressional testimony.¬†¬†


However, the Forest Service said in a response to the GAO that it is making progress and generally agrees with the findings made public Monday. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote that his agency will create and implement a corrective action plan to address the gaps.¬†¬†


Moore also noted 2023 marked a record year for treatments of hazardous fuels on forest lands and his agency was on track to offer more training to build up crews who can specialize in prescribed burn operations.¬†¬†




‚ÄúThe agency is using every tool available to reduce wildfire risk at a pace and scale which will make a difference within our current means,‚Äù Moore wrote.¬†¬†


The GAO reviewed volumes of documents over several months, interviewed forest officials and made site visits over many months. The investigation found the Forest Service has taken steps toward implementing several immediate recommended changes following the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. That included developing a national strategy for mobilizing resources for prescribed fire projects.¬†¬†


There were dozens of other actions the agency identified as part of its 2022 review, but the GAO found ‚Äúimportant gaps remain‚Äù as the Forest Service hasn't determined the extent to which it will implement the remaining actions, including how or when.¬†¬†


The GAO is recommending the Forest Service develop a plan for implementing the reforms, set goals, establish a way to measure progress and ensure it has enough resources dedicated to day-to-day management of the reform effort. It also pointed out that the Forest Service in agency documents recognized the reforms will require major changes to practices and culture.¬†¬†


Leger Fern√°ndez said she hopes change will come quickly because wildfires are becoming more expensive and more dangerous.¬†¬†


‚ÄúThey are killer fires now. They move very fast, and people cannot get out of the way fast enough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I think that kind of massive emergency that they are will lead to faster change than you might normally see in a large federal bureaucracy.‚Äù

## Build Clean Energy on Dirty Land, These Researchers Say

Despite authorizing billions of dollars to subsidize renewable energy development through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden administration remains off track to reach its target of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/DOE%20-%20100%25%20Clean%20Electricity%20-%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100% clean electricity by 2035</u></a>. Even after a banner year in which domestic investment hit <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-clean-energy-investment-jumps-17-hits-1-8-trillion-in-2023-according-to-bloombergnef-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$303 billion</u></a> and the US added <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/Clean_Investment_in_2023_02-21-24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>32.3 gigawatts of new clean electricity capacity</u></a>, the country is still building renewable energy at only <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/reaching-90-percent-clean-electricity-in-the-us-by-2035/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>half the rate that is needed</u></a>.</p>
<p>Among the barriers holding up clean energy deployment, local opposition looms large. As developers seek out new sites on which to build wind and solar, they are repeatedly <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finding themselves at odds</u></a> with neighbors who object to their projects on aesthetic, economic, or political grounds. Whether through <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>formal laws</u></a> or protracted permitting processes, these objections have begun to have a noticeable effect on the pace of renewable energy adoption. In a <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent survey</u></a> by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wind and solar developers reported seeing roughly a third of their siting applications canceled over the five years prior, with two of the most common reasons being ‚Äúcommunity opposition‚Äù and ‚Äúlocal ordinances or zoning.‚Äù </p>
<p>But what if the solution to this impasse has been hiding in plain sight ‚Äî or more accurately, behind a chain link fence? </p>
<p>The U.S. has around <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032113006199#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20about,7.3%20TWh%20from%20landfill%20gas." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>270 million acres</u></a> of so-called ‚Äúmarginal land,‚Äù a designation that includes retired mines, closed landfills, former industrial facilities, brownfield sites, and depleted or unproductive farmland. That‚Äôs around twice the land area that would be required for a renewables-and-nuclear-only power grid, the most land-intensive net-zero scenario <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</u></a>. These neglected properties are more than just an eyesore for neighbors ‚Äî they also represent wasted prospects for economic development, and in many cases pose a contamination risk to the local environment. To law professors <a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/alexandra-klass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alexandra Klass</u></a> and <a href="https://iee.psu.edu/people/hannah-wiseman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hannah Wiseman</u></a>, however, they are an opportunity in disguise. </p>
<p>In their <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4747870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new paper</u></a>, forthcoming in the <em><em>Minnesota Law Review</em></em>, Klass and Wiseman (of the University of Michigan and Penn State, respectively) propose directing the bulk of new clean energy development to these marginal lands. It‚Äôs a concept they call ‚Äúrepurposed energy,‚Äù and it offers a way to, in one fell swoop, avert local objections, reclaim unproductive land, and create new opportunities for economically dislocated communities. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a new concept ‚Äî since 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs <a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RE-Powering America‚Äôs Land Initiative</u></a> has offered funding to developers looking to build renewable energy on potentially contaminated land. </p>
<p>What the new paper proposes, however, is a greater convergence of public benefits on this specific subset of projects, which Klass views as a down payment on societal acceptance. ‚ÄúIf you can come up with a project that‚Äôs going to have community support, that means you can actually build it,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs worth paying a little extra money up front.‚Äù</p>
<p>Consider some of the most common objections to renewable energy siting: that it <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/offshore-wind-critics-say-farms-will-damage-shore-economies-and-ruin-ocean-views/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruins the view</u></a>, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/outdoors/2024/03/02/wisconsin-prairie-chickens-threatened-by-proposed-solar-farm-along-buena-vista-state-wildlife-area/72803144007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disrupts habitats</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/solar-capacity-grows-some-americas-most-productive-farmland-is-risk-2024-04-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occupies valuable farmland</u></a>. Each would seem to carry less weight when applied to, say, an abandoned mine instead of a pristine coastline. Throw in low purchase prices, pre-existing transmission lines at retired coal or gas power plants, and the chance to direct jobs and revenue to low-income communities (where contaminated properties are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ej-research/epa-research-environmental-justice-and-contaminated-sites#:~:text=Low%2Dincome%2C%20tribal%2C%20indigenous,increased%20exposures%20to%20environmental%20hazards." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disproportionately located</u></a>), and you‚Äôve got, in theory, an attractive site for a solar or wind farm. </p>
<p>In spite of these upsides, practical examples of repurposed energy remain few and far between. Only 0.7% of the renewable energy capacity installed in the United States since 1997 has been on reclaimed land, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to EPA data</u></a>. That‚Äôs because, faced with the possibility of extravagant cleanup costs and liability for prior contamination, most developers prefer to take their chances with a greenfield. </p>
<p>Klass and Wiseman propose a set of policy changes that could, they hope, spur a renewable energy renaissance on marginal lands. First, there are some existing incentives for repurposed energy they propose expanding. Certain state funding programs ‚Äì like Massachusetts‚Äô SMART Program ‚Äì and streamlined permitting processes ‚Äì like New York‚Äôs Build-Ready Program ‚Äì could offer a template for other states seeking to accelerate redevelopment of their own brownfields. Layering more such benefits on top of federal funding opportunities like the IRA‚Äôs Energy Infrastructure and Reinvestment Program, they contend, could help stimulate broader interest from developers. </p>
<p>Second, they offer a set of new, more ambitious reforms to entice clean energy companies onto marginal lands. Among them: </p>
<ul><li>Giving the Department of Energy direct permitting authority over repurposed energy would require an act of Congress, but could accelerate approvals. Klass and Wiseman point out that many sites containing hazardous chemicals may already be in the federal regulatory sphere.</li><li>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could direct regional transmission organizations to grant repurposed energy projects priority in interconnection queues, bypassing a lengthy part of the development timeline.</li><li>State offices that oversee brownfield cleanup and development could establish separate divisions for repurposed energy, better equipping them to deal with and resolve clean energy developers‚Äô unique needs. </li></ul>
<p>Klass sees the paper as a timely contribution at a critical juncture for the renewable energy industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at an important moment in time where there‚Äôs a lot of federal funding available,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúBut we are not on track to build the amount of clean energy we need to meet our targets.‚Äù By focusing support on repurposed energy, she thinks policymakers may be able to erode some of the sociopolitical barriers holding back the industry. </p>
<p>There is evidence to support this belief. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2021 study</u></a> found that objections to wind farms tended to fade when the infrastructure was sited in areas with fewer lakes, hills, or other features of aesthetic or recreational value, suggesting that plants sited on already-disturbed land might indeed arouse less opposition. ‚ÄúYou start with these types of projects that we hope will engender less community opposition and provide more community benefits,‚Äù Klass said. ‚ÄúMaybe you scale it up later, maybe you don‚Äôt. But it allows a pathway through some of this local opposition.‚Äù </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a view that resonates in the industry, although that doesn‚Äôt make this kind of development easy. Jonathan Mancini is the senior vice president of solar project development at <a href="https://www.ameresco.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ameresco</u></a>, which has built solar on around 20 landfills across the United States. He told me that sites with soil contamination are capped with an impermeable barrier to prevent the hazardous material from spreading, and building a solar farm on top requires using bespoke racking systems that won‚Äôt penetrate that cap. On top of that, would-be developers have to employ third-party engineers to monitor the cap‚Äôs integrity and undergo additional reviews by state regulators to ensure that the weight of the solar system will not damage it. ‚ÄúCurrently, the permitting timeline for such projects takes up to three years to complete,‚Äù he told me.</p>
<p>Dedicated state support in places like Massachusetts, Illinois, and Maryland has helped Ameresco alleviate some of the costs. ‚ÄúUtility programs or state administered programs do incentivize the use of these types of projects,‚Äù Mancini said. But he noted that more support would be helpful to overcome the barriers repurposed energy projects face. ‚ÄúAdditional policy measures at the local and/or state level would make these projects move faster through permitting and approval.‚Äù </p>
<p>Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University‚Äôs Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and one of the country‚Äôs foremost environmental lawyers, thinks the idea could accelerate clean energy deployment. ‚ÄúLocal opposition is one of the most important impediments [to renewable energy],‚Äù he pointed out to me. By undercutting aesthetic and land use concerns, repurposed energy could ‚Äúhave a very positive impact finding ways to reduce that,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Gerrard also noted, however, that local opposition is not the only barrier to renewable energy development. In addition to more stringent permitting requirements, ‚Äútransmission, interest rates, supply chains, local content restrictions, workforce shortages ‚Äî all of those are impediments,‚Äù he said. Repurposed energy is no magic bullet, he added, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. ‚ÄúWe need a lot of magic buckshot,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand this article proposes quite a few pellets.‚Äù</p>

## NATO chief: Quickest way to end Ukraine war is to lose it; but won‚Äôt bring peace

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†As NATO prepares to convene on Tuesday a three-day summit in Washington to celebrate its 75th birthday, the alliance is reinforcing its support for Ukraine in the ongoing war with Russia.


During a news conference with a handful of reporters Sunday previewing the summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all NATO members want peace, and that can be achieved if Russian President Vladimir Putin understands he cannot win on the battlefield.


‚ÄúThe quickest way to end this war is to lose the war,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut that that will not bring peace. That will bring occupation.‚Äù


Stoltenberg outlined key measures NATO would take, including the establishment of a dedicated command in Germany, enhanced financial and military aid, and bilateral security agreements.


Stoltenberg emphasized these initiatives while addressing the complexities of Ukraine's potential NATO membership and the alliance's united front against Russian aggression.


The precise language of the final agreement of the summit regarding Ukraine‚Äôs NATO membership is still under negotiation, he said.


In April, Stoltenberg said the alliance did not expect to offer Ukraine NATO membership during the summit, but rather a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù to membership.


At the summit, that ‚Äúbridge‚Äù will encompass five essential components:


Security assistance command: NATO is setting up a new command in Germany, with logistical hubs in Eastern Europe, to coordinate international security assistance for Ukraine. This will involve 700 personnel led by a three-star NATO general, according to Stoltenberg.


Stoltenberg said there have been differences among allies about ‚Äúthe approach or types of weapons Ukraine should be delivered.‚Äù Those differences create bureaucratic delays, and the goal is to make delivery faster and easier.


‚ÄúThis new command will have a very robust mandate, so there will be no need for consensus on each and every delivery,‚Äù he said.


Financial pledge: Since February 2022, NATO allies have provided around $43 billion annually in military support to Ukraine. The upcoming summit is expected to extend this commitment for another year, laying a foundation for future support.


Immediate weapon deliveries: Announcements on delivering more weapons and ammunition, particularly air defense systems, are anticipated at the summit to bolster Ukraine's defense.


While the secretary-general did not offer specifics, a senior U.S. official indicated that announcements can be expected from NATO allies this week regarding the provision of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.


Bilateral security agreements: Twenty NATO allies will have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine by the start of the summit, offering additional security guarantees and reinforcing collaborative defense efforts.


Interoperability: Efforts are underway to align Ukrainian armed forces with NATO standards, including a joint training center in Poland and programs on military acquisitions and procurement.


Hungary won‚Äôt participate or obstruct


Stoltenberg addressed concerns about Hungary's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine and its potential to block NATO decisions.


He recounted a recent visit to Budapest, where he secured an agreement with Prime Minister Viktor Orban ensuring that Hungary will not obstruct the proposed support measures for Ukraine.


Budapest will not participate in the new NATO security assistance command for Ukraine but will fulfill its other NATO obligations and contribute to the common budget, Stoltenberg said.


The secretary general highlighted NATO's diverse engagements with Moscow even after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.


He noted a recent conversation between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, underscoring the routine nature of such contacts.


Stoltenberg said NATO must function cohesively in developing new defense strategies, emphasizing unity despite differing perspectives, such as those represented by leaders like Orban.


Future relationship with the US 


Stoltenberg is confident that the United States would continue to be a staunch NATO ally regardless of future election outcomes, attributing past criticisms by former president Donald Trump primarily to defense spending issues rather than NATO itself.


He emphasized that any secretary-general must be able to work with all leaders within the alliance, comparing NATO to a big family that every now and then has arguments and disagreements.


Stoltenberg recounted his experience working with presidents Barak Obama, Trump, and Joe Biden, noting that despite differing political leadership, the U.S. has remained a steadfast and committed NATO ally.

## US troops leave Niger base at Niamey

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

Niamey, Niger  ‚Äî¬†U.S. troops have completed a withdrawal from their base in Niger's capital of Niamey and will fully depart from Agadez in the north before a Sept. 15 deadline set by the country's military rulers, both countries said Sunday.


Niger's military leaders scrapped a military cooperation deal with Washington in March, after seizing power in a July 2023 coup.


The United States had around 650 soldiers in Niger as part of anti-jihadist missions in several Sahel nations of West Africa, including a major drone base near Agadez.


"The defense ministry of Niger and the U.S. Defense Department announce that the withdrawal of American forces and equipment from the Niamey base 101 is now completed," the two countries said in a statement.


A final flight carrying U.S. troops was due to leave Niamey late Sunday.


The U.S. presence had stood at around 950 troops, and 766 soldiers have left Niger since the military ordered their departure, AFP learned at a ceremony at the base attended by Niger's army chief of staff Maman Sani Kiaou and US General Kenneth Ekman.


"American forces are now going to focus on quitting airbase 201 in Agadez," the statement said, insisting that the withdrawal would be completed by September 15 as planned.


Niger had already ordered the withdrawal of troops from France, the former colonial power and traditional security ally, and has strengthened ties with Russia which has provided instructors and equipment.


On Saturday, Germany's defense ministry also said it would end operations at its airbase in Niger by August 31 following the breakdown of talks with military leaders.


A similar shift has taken place in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also ruled by military leaders and faced with violence from jihadist groups.

## New Orleans Essence Festival wraps up 4-day celebration of Black culture

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans, Louisiana ‚Äî¬†For 30 years, the Essence Festival of Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences and, of course, music.


The nation‚Äôs largest annual celebration of Black culture was set to end Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special tribute to Frankie Beverly & Maze, the soul band that closed the event for the festival's first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell tour.


Others scheduled to perform included Victoria Monet, Teedra Moses, Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony Hamilton.


Barkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps connect the global Black community.


‚ÄúHistorically, as Black people, sometimes we're not sure where our heritage comes from,‚Äù Tubman-Zawolo said. "America is just one place. But within America there‚Äôs a melting pot of different Black cultures: Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our power to be even greater."


Tubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this year's Film Festival, held at the city's convention center, where fans heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean ‚Äúwho are targeting our stories about us, for us, globally.‚Äù


She noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad and Ayra Starr of Nigeria.


‚ÄúAll of that occurred over four days,‚Äù Tubman-Zawolo said. ‚ÄúBut the beauty of it is, it doesn't stay here. (Fans) take it with them.‚Äù


New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year's ‚ÄúWe Love Us‚Äù theme was appropriate.


‚ÄúThis whole ‚ÄòWe Love Us‚Äô theme brought us together to build communities,‚Äù she said.


The festival's impact on the city and state has surpassed $300 million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.


Essence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the magazine's history.


‚ÄúThe locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and touch and feel and smell. That has been a part of the evolution of Essence,‚Äù Cantrell said.


The event's current contract ends in 2026, but Essence Ventures CEO Caroline Wanga has said the festival's ‚Äúforever home‚Äù is New Orleans.


‚ÄúThat's what we believe as well,‚Äù Cantrell said. ‚ÄúWe have a foundation that's been laid over 30 years. The city is always ready and prepared to host this event and more. I think staying in New Orleans is the best fit and best marriage, the best partnership.‚Äù

## US envoy expresses regret over alleged military sex crimes in Okinawa

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

Tokyo ‚Äî¬†U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel expressed regret Saturday for the handling of two cases of sexual assaults allegedly committed by American military personnel on Okinawa, which have again stoked resentment of the heavy U.S. troop presence on the strategic island in Japan's far southwest.


The issue broke out late last month, triggering an uproar over reports that two American service members had been charged with sexual assaults months earlier.


Both cases were first reported in local media in late June. In one arrest made in March, a member of the U.S. Air Force was charged with the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenager, and while in May a U.S. Marine was arrested on charges of attempted rape resulting in injury. Further details about the alleged victims were not released.


Okinawa police said they did not announce the cases out of privacy considerations related to the victims. The Foreign Ministry, per police decision, also did not notify Okinawa prefectural officials.


The cases are a reminder to many Okinawans of the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. service members, which sparked massive protests of the U.S. presence. It led to a 1996 agreement between Tokyo and Washington to close a key U.S. air base, although the plan has been repeatedly delayed due to protests at the site designated for its replacement on another part of the island.


Emanuel said he deeply regretted what happened to the individuals, their families and their community, but fell short of apologizing. ‚ÄúObviously, you got to let the criminal justice process play out. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt express on a human level your sense of regret.‚Äù


"We have to do better,‚Äù he said, adding that the U.S. military's high standards and protocols for education and training of its troops was ‚Äújust not working.‚Äù


Emanuel said the U.S. may be able to propose measures to improve training and transparency with the public at U.S.-Japan foreign and defense ministers‚Äô security talks expected later this month in Tokyo.


On Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the Japanese authorities would do their utmost to provide more prompt disclosures of alleged crime related to U.S. military personnel on Okinawa while protecting victims‚Äô privacy.


The cases could be a setback for the defense relationship at a time when Okinawa is seen increasingly important in the face of rising tensions with China.


Some 50,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Japan under a bilateral security pact, about half of them on Okinawa, where residents have long complained about heavy U.S. troop presence and related accidents, crime and noise.


Emanuel commented on the issue while visiting Fukushima, on Japan's northeast coast.


Earlier Saturday, the ambassador visited the nearby town of Minamisoma to join junior surfers and sample locally-caught flounder for lunch, aiming to highlight the safety of the area's seawater and seafood amid ongoing discharges of treated and diluted radioactive water from the tsunami-ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.


China has banned Japanese seafood over the discharges, a move Emanuel criticized as unjustified.

## 'Despicable Me 4' debuts, raking in $122.6 million since opening Wednesday

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

New York ‚Äî¬†After a historically bad first half of the year, the box office is suddenly booming.


‚ÄúDespicable Me 4,‚Äù the Illumination Animation sequel, led the way over the holiday weekend with $75 million in ticket sales Friday through Sunday and $122.6 million since opening Wednesday, according to studio estimates Sunday.


The Independence Day holiday weekend haul for the Universal Pictures' release further extends the considerable box-office reign of the Minions, arguably the most bankable force in movies today. And it also kept a summer streak going for Hollywood.


Though overall ticket sales were down more than 40% from levels prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, heading into the summer moviegoing season, theaters have lately seen a succession of hits. After Sony‚Äôs ‚ÄúBad Boys: Ride or Die‚Äù outperformed expectations, Pixar‚Äôs ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù rapidly cleared $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide, making it the first release since ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù to reach that mark. Last weekend, the Paramount prequel ‚ÄúA Quiet Place: Day One‚Äù also came in above expectations.


With ‚ÄúDeadpool & Wolverine‚Äù tracking for a $160 million launch later this month, Hollywood‚Äôs summer is looking up.


‚ÄúIf you look at the mood of the industry about eight weeks ago, very different than today,‚Äù says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. ‚ÄúThe song says what a difference a day makes. What a difference a month has made.‚Äù

It helps to have the Minions at your disposal. Since first debuting in the 2010 original ‚ÄúDespicable Me,‚Äù each entry of the franchise ‚Äî including two sequels and two ‚ÄúMinions‚Äù spinoffs ‚Äî has seemingly guaranteed to gross around $1 billion. The four previous movies all made between $939 million (2022‚Äôs ‚ÄúMinions: Rise of Gru‚Äù) and $1.26 billion (2015‚Äôs ‚ÄúMinions‚Äù) globally.


That run has helped give Illumination founder and chief executive Chris Meledandri one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood. ‚ÄúDespicable Me 4,‚Äù directed by Chris Renaud and Patrick Delage, returns the voice cast led by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig and doubles down on more Minion mayhem. Reviews (54% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren‚Äôt particularly good for the latest installment, which includes a witness protection plot and a group of Minions transformed into a superhero squadron. But in their 12-year run, little has slowed down the Minions.


‚ÄúThis is one of the most beloved franchises, quite frankly, in the history of film, and certainly animation,‚Äù said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. ‚ÄúChris Meledandri and Illumination have their finger on the pulse of what families and audiences around the world want to see.‚Äù


Family movies are powering the box office. ‚ÄúDespicable Me 4‚Äù performed strongly despite the still considerable drawing power of ‚ÄúInside Out 2.‚Äù In its fourth weekend of release, the Pixar sequel added another $30 million domestically and $78.3 million overseas.


‚ÄúInside Out 2,‚Äù with $1.22 billion in ticket sales thus far, is easily the year‚Äôs biggest hit and fast climbing up the all-time ranks for animated releases. It currently ranks as the No. 5 animated release worldwide.


Instead of cannibalizing the opening weekend for ‚ÄúDespicable Me 4,‚Äù ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù may have helped get families back in the habit of heading to theaters.


‚ÄúWhat happened, I think, is the release calendar finally settled into a nice rhythm,‚Äù said Dergarabedian, referencing the jumbled movie schedule from last year‚Äôs strikes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about momentum.‚Äù


The continued strong sales for ‚ÄúInside Out 2‚Äù were enough to put the film in second place for the domestic weekend. Last week‚Äôs top new film, ‚ÄúA Quiet Place: Day One,‚Äù slid to third with $21 million in its second weekend, with another $21.1 million from overseas theaters. That was a steep decrease of 60%, though the Paramount prequel has amassed $178.2 million worldwide in two weeks.

The run of hits has caused some studios to boost their forecasts for the summer movie season. Heading into the most lucrative season at theaters, analysts were predicting a $3 billion summer, down from the more typical $4 billion mark. Now, closer to $3.4 billion appears likely.


The weekend‚Äôs other top new release was Ti West‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaXXXine,‚Äù the third in a string of slasher films from A24 starring Mia Goth. In 2,450 locations, ‚ÄúMaXXXine‚Äù collected $6.7 million in ticket sales, a franchise best. The film, which follows ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù (both released in 2022), stars Goth as a 1980s Hollywood starlet being hunted by a killer known as the Night Stalker.


Angel Studios, which last year released the unexpected summer hit ‚ÄúSound of Freedom,‚Äù struggled to find the same success with its latest Christian film, ‚ÄúSound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot.‚Äù It debuted with $3.2 million.


Kevin Costner‚Äôs big-budget gamble, ‚ÄúHorizon: An American Saga,‚Äù didn‚Äôt do much to turn around its fortunes in its second weekend. The first chapter in what Costner hopes will be a four-part franchise ‚Äì including a chapter two Warner Bros. will release in August ‚Äì earned $5.5 million in its second weekend. The film, which cost more than $100 million to make, has grossed $22.2 million in two weeks.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. ‚ÄúDespicable Me 4,‚Äù $75 million.

2. ‚ÄúInside Out 2,‚Äù $30 million.

3. ‚ÄúA Quiet Place Day One,‚Äù $21 million.

4. ‚ÄúMaXXXine,‚Äù $6.7 million.

5. ‚ÄúBad Boys: Ride or Die,‚Äù $6.5 million.

6. ‚ÄúHorizon: An American Saga, Chapter 1,‚Äù $5.5 million.

7. ‚ÄúSound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,‚Äù $3.2 million.

8. ‚ÄúKaiki 2898,‚Äù $1.8 million.

9. ‚ÄúThe Bikeriders,‚Äù $1.3 million.

10. ‚ÄúKinds of Kindness,‚Äù $860,000.

## Texas coastal residents told to expect power outages, flooding as Beryl moves closer to landfall

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

MATAGORDA, TEXAS ‚Äî¬†Beryl began lashing Texas with rain and intensifying winds Sunday as coastal residents boarded up windows, left beach towns under evacuation orders and prepared for the powerful storm that has already cut a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.


Although Beryl remained a tropical storm Sunday as it churned toward Texas, it threatened to potentially regain hurricane strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall early Monday. The storm was projected to come ashore in the middle of the Texas coast around Matagorda Bay, an area about 161 kilometers (100 miles) south of Houston, but officials cautioned the path could still change.


Texas officials warned the storm would cause power outages and flooding but also expressed worry that not enough coastal residents and beach vacationers in Beryl's path were heeding warnings to leave.


"One of the things that kind of trigger our concern a little bit, we've looked at all of the roads leaving the coast and the maps are still green," said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as the state's acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is traveling overseas. "So we don't see many people leaving."




Along the Texas coast, many residents and business owners took the typical storm precautions, but also expressed uncertainty about the storm's intensity.


In Port Lavaca, Jimmy May fastened plywood over the windows of his electrical supply company and said he wasn't concerned about the possible storm surge. He recalled that his business had escaped flooding in a previous hurricane that brought a 6-meter storm surge.


"In town, you know, if you're in the low-lying areas, obviously, you need to get out of there," he said.


At the nearby marina, Percy Roberts showed his neighbor Ken Waller how to properly secure his boat as heavy winds rolled in from the bay Sunday evening.


"This is actually going to be the first hurricane I'm going to be experiencing," Waller said, noting that he's a little nervous but feels safe following Roberts' lead. "Pray for the best but expect the worst, I guess."


Farther down the coast in Freeport, Mark Richardson, a 64-year-old retiree, said homeowners were busy "trying to tie everything down" and worried that Beryl had people unsure about where along the Texas coast it would make landfall. He spent Sunday morning on the beach and said ocean swells were quickly rising.


"The ocean is getting very angry, very fast," he said.


The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.


Three times in its one week of life, Beryl has gained 56 kph in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.


Beryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm shows the literal hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean, and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said.


Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind. The hurricane warning extended from Baffin Bay, south of Corpus Christi, to Sargent, south of Houston.


Beryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for Houston, where storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation's fourth-largest city and flooded neighborhoods. A flash flood watch was in effect for a wide swath of the Texas coast, where forecasters expected Beryl to dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain in some areas.


Potential storm surges between 1.22 and 2.13 meters above ground level were forecast around Matagorda. The warnings extended to the same coastal areas where Hurricane Harvey came ashore in 2017 as a Category 4 hurricane, far more powerful than Beryl's expected intensity by the time the storm reaches landfall.


Those looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that option all but impossible as Beryl closed in. Hundreds of flights from Houston's two major commercial airports had been delayed by midafternoon Sunday and dozens more canceled, according to FlightAware data.


In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible. Residents were advised to secure homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard against possible flooding.


The White House said Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had sent emergency responders, search-and-rescue teams, bottled water, and other resources along the coast.


Several coastal counties called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas that are prone to flooding. Local officials also banned beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the Fourth of July holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.


Beryl earlier this week battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.


Before hitting Mexico, Beryl wrought destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Three people were reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica.


Beryl would be the 10th hurricane to hit Texas in July since 1851 and the fourth in the last 25 years, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

## An Alaska tourist spot will vote whether to ban cruise ships on Saturdays to give locals a break

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

JUNEAU, Alaska ‚Äî¬†Each year, a crush of tourists arrives in Alaska's capital city on cruise ships to see wonders like the fast-diminishing Mendenhall Glacier. Now, long-simmering tensions over Juneau's tourism boom are coming to a head over a new voter initiative aimed at giving residents a respite from the influx.


A measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers from docking in Juneau on Saturdays qualified for the Oct. 1 municipal ballot, setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too much in a city that is experiencing first-hand the impacts of climate change. The measure would also ban ships on July 4, a day when locals flock to a downtown parade.


The ‚Äúship-free Saturdays‚Äù initiative that qualified last week will go to voters unless the local Assembly enacts a similar measure by Aug. 15, which is seen as unlikely.


Juneau, accessible only by water or air, is home to the Mendenhall Glacier, a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on multi-story ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline. Many residents of this city of about 32,000 have concerns about increased traffic, congested trails and the frequent buzz of sight-seeing helicopters transporting visitors to the Mendenhall and other glaciers.




Deborah Craig, who has lived in Juneau for decades, supports ship-free Saturdays. Craig, who lives across the channel from where the ships dock, often hears their early-morning fog horns and broadcast announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water.


The current ‚Äúoverwhelming" number of visitors diminishes what residents love so much about Juneau, she said.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in Juneau, which is about clean air, clean water, pristine environment and easy access to trails, easy access to water sports and nature," she said of the initiative.


‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this perception that some people are not welcoming of tourists, and that‚Äôs not the case at all," Craig said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about volume. It‚Äôs about too much ‚Äî too many in a short period of time overwhelming a small community.‚Äù


The current cruise season runs from early April to late October.


Opponents of the initiative say limiting dockings will hurt local businesses that rely heavily on tourism and could invite lawsuits. A voter-approved limit on cruise passenger numbers in Bar Harbor, Maine, another community with a significant tourism economy, was challenged in federal court.


Laura McDonnell, a business leader who owns Caribou Crossings, a gift shop in Juneau‚Äôs downtown tourist core, said she makes 98% of her annual revenue during the summer season.


Tourism is about all the "local businesses that rely on cruise passengers and our place in the community,‚Äù said McDonnell, who is involved in Protect Juneau‚Äôs Future, which opposes the initiative.


Some schools recently closed due to factors including declining enrollment, while the regional economy faces challenges, she said.


‚ÄúI think that as a community, we really need to look at what‚Äôs at stake for our economy," she said. ‚ÄúWe are not in a position to be shrinking our economy.‚Äù


The cruise industry accounted for $375 million in direct spending in Juneau in 2023, most of that attributable to spending by passengers, according to a report prepared for the city by McKinley Research Group LLC.




After a two-year pandemic lull, cruise passenger numbers rose sharply in Juneau, hitting a record of more than 1.6 million in 2023. Under this year's schedule, Sept. 21 will be the first day since early May with no large ships in town.


The tourism debate is polarizing, and the city has been trying to find a middle ground, said Alexandra Pierce, Juneau's visitor industry director. But she noted there also needs to be a regional solution.


If the Juneau initiative passes, it will impact other, smaller communities in southeast Alaska because the ships, generally on trips originating in Seattle or Vancouver, Canada, will have to go somewhere if they can‚Äôt dock in Juneau on Saturdays, she said.


Some residents in Sitka, south of Juneau, are in the early stages of trying to limit cruise visitation to that small, island community, which is near a volcano.


Juneau and major cruise lines, including Carnival Corp., Disney Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group, agreed to a limit of five large ships a day, which took effect this year. They more recently signed a pact, set to take effect in 2026, seeking a daily limit of 16,000 cruise passengers Sundays through Fridays and 12,000 on Saturdays.


Pierce said the overall goal is to keep total cruise passenger visitation around 1.6 million, and to even out daily numbers of visitors that can spike to about 18,000 on the busiest days and feel ‚Äúa bit suffocating." Juneau traditionally has been the most popular cruise port in the state.


A number of projects around Juneau are expected to help make existing cruise numbers feel less impactful. Those include plans for a gondola at the city-owned ski area and increased visitor capacity at the Mendenhall Glacier recreation area, she said.


Ren√©e Limoge Reeve, vice president of government and community relations for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association Alaska, said the agreements signed with the city were the first of their kind in Alaska.


The best strategy is ‚Äúongoing, direct dialogue with local communities" and working together in a way that also provides a predictable source of income for local businesses, she said.


Protect Juneau's Future, led by local business leaders, said the success of the ballot measure would mean a loss of sales tax revenue and millions of dollars in direct spending by cruise passengers. The group was confident voters would reject the measure, its steering committee said in a statement.


Karla Hart, a sponsor of the initiative and frequent critic of the cruise industry, said the threat of litigation has kept communities from taking steps to limit cruise numbers in the past. She was heartened by legal wins this year in the ongoing fight over the measure passed in Bar Harbor, a popular destination near Maine's Acadia National Park.


She believes the Juneau initiative will pass.

## Torrid heat bakes millions in large swaths of US, setting records and fanning wildfires

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

Las Vegas ‚Äî¬†Roughly 130 million people were under threat over the weekend and into next week from a long-running heat wave that broke or tied records with dangerously high temperatures and is expected to shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said.


Ukiah, north of San Francisco, hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, breaking the city's record for the date and tying its all-time high. Livermore, east of San Francisco, hit 111 F (43.8 C), breaking the daily maximum temperature record of 109 F (42.7 C) set more than a century ago in 1905.


Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F (46.7 C) dating to 1942.


The National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat warning for much of the Southwest through Friday.


‚ÄúA dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday timeframe,‚Äù the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated forecast.


In Las Vegas, where the mercury hit 100 F (37.7 C) by 10:30 a.m., Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a seat at a slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.


‚ÄúBut you know, after it hits triple digits it‚Äôs about all the same to me,‚Äù said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada to see a Dead & Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôll play one of my favorites ‚Äî ‚ÄòCold Rain and Snow.‚Äô‚Äù


In more humid parts of the country, temperatures could spike above 100 F (about 38 C) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a weather service meteorologist.


Heat records shattered across the Southwest



Meteorologists predicted that temperatures would be near daily records in the region through most, if not all, of the coming week, with lower desert highs reaching 115 to 120 degrees F (46.1 to 48.8 C).




Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada, with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of ‚Äúmajor heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.‚Äù


‚ÄúHow hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western Nevada and northeastern California) won't get below 100 degrees (37.8 C) until next weekend,‚Äù the service posted online. ‚ÄúAnd unfortunately, there won't be much relief overnight either."


Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old record of 101 F (38.3 C).


More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C) for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park, and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.


The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.




The worst is yet to come across the West and mid-Atlantic

Triple-digit temperatures are likely in the West, between 15 and 30 F (8 and 16 C) higher than average into next week, the National Weather Service said.


The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures. Baltimore and others parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat warning as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters said.


"Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors," read a National Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. ‚ÄúYoung children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.‚Äù


Deaths are starting to mount


In Arizona‚Äôs Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are still under investigation, according to a recent report.


That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in Phoenix who suffered a ‚Äúheat-related medical event‚Äù while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.


California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures

Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or retardant on a series of wildfires in California.


In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass, brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying ‚Äúextreme fire behavior‚Äù and had the ‚Äúpotential for large growth‚Äù with high temperatures and low humidity.


Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade

At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.


Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied sunscreen.


‚ÄúDefinitely a difference between the shade and the sun,‚Äù Quiroz said Friday. ‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôre in the sun, it feels like you‚Äôre cooking.‚Äù

## NATO to discuss Russia-North Korea military cooperation

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

Washington ‚Äî¬†The NATO summit scheduled for this week will include a discussion among the allies about strengthening security ties with South Korea and Japan against deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, experts said.


The leaders of 32 NATO members will convene in Washington July 9 to 11 to discuss ways to provide continued military support to Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia, which invaded more than two years ago.


Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea ‚Äî sometimes referred to as the Indo-Pacific 4 or IP4 ‚Äî are invited to the NATO summit. The United States, Japan and South Korea plan to meet on the sidelines of the summit.


Among the items that analysts expect NATO to discuss with Japan and South Korea is the growing military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.


"The Russian-North Korean agreement is a problem for both NATO countries and for the countries in the Northeast Asia," said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.


"I expect that it will be discussed at this meeting. It may become a critical aspect of the meeting, if, by that time, intelligence is saying that North Korea is sending many military personnel to support Russia in Ukraine," Bennett said.


After Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense pact in Pyongyang last month, some speculated that North Korea could dispatch army engineers to Russian-occupied Donetsk to rebuild the war-torn region.


Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said at a press conference on June 25 that the U.S. is keeping an eye on a possible dispatch of troops but warned North Korea about sending military forces, saying they would be "cannon fodder in an illegal war against Ukraine."


North Korea on June 27 renewed its support for Russia's war against Ukraine, saying, "We will always be on the side of the Russian army" in "the war of justice."


Both Washington and Seoul have estimated that Pyongyang sent about 10,000 containers of munitions to Russia. Moscow and Pyongyang denied arms exchanges between the two.




But in the defense pact that Putin and Kim signed last month, they agreed to set up ways to bolster their defense capabilities and openly announced possible military and technical cooperation.




"NATO members will discuss the implications of closer Russia-North Korea relations and how best to respond, including in terms of risks and opportunities," said Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.


"Risks primarily include material outcomes, such as how North Korea involvement will come to bear on warfighting in Ukraine. But there are also opportunities to be exploited, including how to use increased North Korea involvement to drive a wedge between China and Russia," he said.


"The reemerging axis between China, Russia and North Korea has most certainly precipitated the security link between Europe and Asia. As a result, I expect increased NATO involvement in East Asia, especially with Japan, which is the world's greatest latent military power," Brummer said.


Beijing said that it is keeping "a close eye" on the NATO summit and that it hopes the summit does not "target any third party."


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Tuesday that "the Asia-Pacific lies beyond the geographical scope of the North Atlantic" and that "NATO's attempt to make eastward inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace and stability.‚Äù


"The countries and people in this region are on high alert against this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation," he said.


The U.S. State Department did not respond to an inquiry by VOA's Korean Service seeking a response to Beijing's comments.




Luis Simon, director of the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels, Belgium, said he would not rule out NATO countries conducting joint military exercises with its East Asian partners "in the Korean Peninsula context rather than in a China context" because it offers "diplomatically an easier entry point."


At the same time, he said, "It will be more with NATO allies rather than the NATO as a whole because NATO as a whole is very clear about being laser focused" on defending Ukraine.


The Japan Air Self-Defense Force announced on June 25 that it will hold a series of joint drills in July with Germany, Spain and France ‚Äî all NATO members.


David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, also said that bilateral arrangements between South Korea and individual NATO countries could be possible as "a number of NATO countries are member states of the United Nations Command."


The U.N. Command is a multinational military body created during the Korean War of 1950-53 to defend against North Korean aggression.


Some analysts said there are limits to NATO's involvement in the Indo-Pacific.


"Most of the countries in NATO are focused on the Atlantic area, and those who have projection capabilities" that can go beyond that "have rather small ones," said Barry Posen, Ford international professor of political science at MIT.


William Ruger, a nonresident senior fellow at Defense Priorities, said U.S. "capabilities, material and policy bandwidth" are not sufficient to deal with the security of both Europe and Asia.

## Sizzling sidewalks, unshaded playgrounds pose risk of burns

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX, Arizona ‚Äî¬†Ron Falk lost his right leg, had extensive skin grafting on the left one and is still recovering a year after collapsing on the searing asphalt outside a Phoenix convenience store where he stopped for a cold soda during a heat wave.


Now using a wheelchair, the 62-year-old lost his job and his home. He‚Äôs recovering at a medical respite center for patients with no other place to go; there he gets physical therapy and treatment for a bacterial infection in what remains of his right leg, which is too swollen to use the prosthesis he‚Äôd hoped would help him walk again.


‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get somewhere to cool down, the heat will affect you,‚Äù said Falk, who lost consciousness due to heat stroke. ‚ÄúThen you won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, like in my case.‚Äù


Sizzling sidewalks and unshaded playgrounds pose risks for surface burns as air temperatures reach new summertime highs in Southwest U.S. cities such as Phoenix, which just recorded its hottest June on record. The average daytime high was 43 degrees Celsius (109.5 degrees Fahrenheit), without a single 24-hour high below 37.7 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).


Young children, older adults and homeless people are especially at risk for contact burns, which can occur in seconds when skin touches a surface of 82 C (180 F).


Since the beginning of June, 50 people have been hospitalized with such burns, and four have died at Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix, which operates the Southwest‚Äôs largest burn center, serving patients from six states, according to its director, Dr. Kevin Foster. About 80% were injured in metro Phoenix.


Last year, the center admitted 136 patients for surface burns from June through August, up from 85 during the same period in 2022, Foster said. Fourteen died. One out of five were homeless.


‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs record heat wave brought an alarming number of patients with life-threatening burns,‚Äù Foster said of a 31-day period with temperatures at or above 43 C (110 F) during Phoenix‚Äôs hottest summer.




In Las Vegas, which regularly sees summertime highs in the triple digits, 22 people were hospitalized in June alone at the University Medical Center‚Äôs Lions Burn Care Center, said spokesperson Scott Kerbs. That's nearly half as many as the 46 hospitalized during all three summer months last year.


As in Phoenix, the desert sun punishes Las Vegas for hours every day, frying outdoor surfaces such as asphalt, concrete and metal doors on cars and playground equipment such as swings and monkey bars.


Contact with pavement


Surface burn victims often include children injured walking barefoot on concrete or touching hot surfaces, adults who collapsed on a sidewalk while intoxicated, and older people who fell on the pavement due to heat stroke or another medical emergency.


Some don‚Äôt survive.


Thermal injuries were among the main or contributing causes of last year‚Äôs 645 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix.


One victim was an 82-year-old woman with dementia and heart disease admitted to a suburban Phoenix hospital after being found on the scorching pavement on an August day that hit 41.1 C (106 F).


With a body temperature of 40.5 C (105 F), the woman was rushed to the hospital with second-degree burns on her back and right side, covering 8% of her body. She died three days later.


Many surface burn patients also suffered potentially fatal heat stroke.


Valleywise hospital‚Äôs emergency department recently adopted a new protocol for all heat stroke victims: submerging patients in a bag of slushy ice to quickly bring down body temperature.


Recovery for those with skin burns was often lengthy, with patients undergoing multiple skin grafts and other surgeries, followed by months of recovery in skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities.


Bob Woolley, 71, suffered second- and third-degree burns to his hands, arms, leg and torso after he stumbled onto the broiling backyard rock garden at his Phoenix home while wearing only swim trunks and a tank top.


‚ÄúThe ordeal was extremely painful; it was almost unbearable,‚Äù said Woolley, who was hospitalized at the Valleywise burn center for several months. He said he considers himself ‚Äú95% recovered‚Äù after extensive skin grafts and physical therapy and has resumed some former activities such as swimming and motorcycle riding. ¬†


Children among the burned


Some burn victims in Phoenix and Las Vegas were children.


‚ÄúIn many cases, this involves toddlers walking or crawling onto hot surfaces,‚Äù Kerbs said of those hospitalized at the Las Vegas center.


Foster said about 20% of the hospitalized and outpatient skin-burn victims seen at the Phoenix center are children.




Small children aren‚Äôt fully aware of the harm a sizzling metal door handle or a scorching sidewalk can cause.


‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre playing, they don‚Äôt pay attention,‚Äù said urban climatologist Ariane Middel, an assistant professor at Arizona State University who directs the SHaDE Lab, a research team that studies the effects of urban heat.


‚ÄúThey may not even notice that it‚Äôs hot.‚Äù


In measuring surface temperatures of playground equipment, the team found that in 37.7-degree C (100 F) weather without shade, a slide can heat up to 71.1 C (160 F), but a covering can bring that down to 43.8 C (111 F). A rubber ground cover can hit as high as 86.6 C (188 F), a handrail can heat up to 48.8 C (120 F) and concrete can reach 55.5 C (132 F).


Many metro Phoenix parks have covered picnic tables and plastic fabric stretched over play equipment, keeping metal or plastic surfaces up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. But plenty do not, Middel said.


She said cooler wood chips are better underfoot than rubber mats, which were designed to protect kids from head injuries but soak up heat in the broiling sun. Like rubber, artificial turf gets hotter than asphalt.


‚ÄúWe need to think about alternative surface types, because most surfaces we use for our infrastructure are heat sponges," Middel said.


Pets in danger, too


Hot concrete and asphalt also pose burn risks for pets.


Veterinarians recommend dogs wear booties to protect their paws during outdoor walks in summer or keeping them on cooler grassy areas. Owners are also advised to make sure their pets drink plenty of water and don‚Äôt get overheated. Phoenix bans dogs from the city‚Äôs popular hiking trails on days the National Weather Service issues an excessive heat warning.


Recovering at Phoenix's Circle the City, a respite care facility he was sent to after being released from Valleywise's burn unit, Falk said he never imagined the Phoenix heat could cause him to collapse on the broiling asphalt in his shorts and T-shirt.


Because he wasn't carrying identification or a phone, no one knew where he was for months. He has a long road ahead but still hopes to regain part of his old life, working for a concessionaire for entertainment events.


‚ÄúI kind of went into a downward spiral,‚Äù Falk said. ‚ÄúI finally woke up and said, ‚ÄôHey, wait, I lost a leg.' But that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre useless.‚Äù

## North Dakota tribe goes back to its roots with a massive greenhouse operation

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

BISMARCK, North Dakota ‚Äî¬†A Native American tribe in North Dakota will soon grow lettuce in a giant greenhouse complex that when fully completed will be among the country's largest, enabling the tribe to grow much of its own food decades after a federal dam flooded the land where they had cultivated corn, beans and other crops for millennia.


Work is ongoing on the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation's 1.3-hectare greenhouse that will make up most of the Native Green Grow operation's initial phase. However, enough of the structure will be completed this summer to start growing leafy greens and other crops such as tomatoes and strawberries.


"We're the first farmers of this land," Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said. "We once were part of an Aboriginal trade center for thousands and thousands of years because we grew crops ‚Äî corn, beans, squash, watermelons ‚Äî all these things at massive levels, so all the tribes depended on us greatly as part of the Aboriginal trade system."


The tribe will spend roughly $76 million on the initial phase, which also will include a warehouse and other facilities near the tiny town of Parshall. It plans to add to the growing space in the coming years, eventually totaling about 5.9 hectares, which officials say would make it one of the world's largest facilities of its type.


The tribe's fertile land along the Missouri River was inundated in the mid-1950s when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison Dam, which created Lake Sakakawea.




Getting fresh produce has long been a challenge in the area of western North Dakota where the tribe is based, on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The rolling, rugged landscape ‚Äî split by Lake Sakakawea ‚Äî is a long drive from the state's biggest cities, Bismarck and Fargo.


That isolation makes the greenhouses all the more important, as they will enable the tribe to provide food to the roughly 8,300 people on the Fort Berthold reservation and to reservations elsewhere. The tribe also hopes to stock food banks that serve isolated and impoverished areas in the region, and plans to export its produce.


Initially, the MHA Nation expects to grow nearly 907,000 kilograms of food a year and for that to eventually increase to 5.4 million to 6.4 million kilograms annually. Fox said the operation's first phase will create 30 to 35 jobs.


The effort coincides with a national move to increase food sovereignty among tribes.


Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic led tribes nationwide to use federal coronavirus aid to invest in food systems, including underground greenhouses in South Dakota to feed the local community, said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Tribal Relations. In Oklahoma, multiple tribes are running or building their own meat processing plant, she said.


The USDA promotes its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which "really challenges us to think about food and the way we do business at USDA from an Indigenous, tribal lens," Thompson said. Examples include Indigenous seed hubs, foraging videos and guides, cooking videos and a meat processing program for Indigenous animals.


"We have always been a very independent, sovereign people that have been able to hunt, gather, grow and feed ourselves, and forces have intervened over the last century that have disrupted those independent food resources, and it made it very challenging. But the desire and goal has always been there," said Thompson, whose tribal affiliation is Cheyenne River Sioux.


The MHA Nation's greenhouse plans are possible in large part because of access to potable water and natural gas resources.


The natural gas released in North Dakota's Bakken oil field has long been seen by critics as a waste and environmental concern, but Fox said the tribal nation intends to capture and compress that gas to heat and power the greenhouse and process into fertilizer.


Flaring, in which natural gas is burned off from pipes that emerge from the ground, has been a longtime issue in the No. 3 oil-producing state.


North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said that key to capturing the gas is building needed infrastructure, as the MHA Nation intends to do.


"With those operators that are trying to get to that level of zero, it's certainly going to take more infrastructure, more buildout of pipes, processing plants, all of the above to stay on top of this issue," he said.


The Fort Berthold Reservation had nearly 3,000 active wells in April, when oil production totaled 203,000 barrels a day on the reservation. Oil production has helped the MHA Nation build schools, roads, housing and medical facilities, Fox said.

## 'Ready to come out?' Scientists emerge after year 'on Mars'

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

washington ‚Äî¬†The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: "You ready to come out?"¬†


The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars, spill out to cheers and applause.¬†


Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the "Martian" habitat in Houston, Texas, part of NASA's research into what it will take to put humans on the Red Planet. ¬†


They have been growing vegetables, conducting "Marswalks," and operating under what NASA terms "additional stressors," such as communication delays with "Earth," including their families; isolation and confinement. ¬†


It's the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent. ¬†


"Hello. It's actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to you," Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh.¬†


"I really hope I don't cry standing up here in front of all of you," Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in the crowd. ¬†


The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed, 160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas, and a vertical farm for growing food.¬†


An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and is where the team donned suits to conduct their "Marswalks," though it is still covered rather than being open air.¬†


"They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their performance ... as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet," Steve Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA's Johnson Space Center.¬†


"I'm very appreciative," he added.¬†


This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA, grouped under the title CHAPEA ‚Äî Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog.¬†


A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at the helm.¬†


Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.
