id="colorado-reporters-expulsion-from-republican-gathering-causes-uproar">Colorado
reporter’s expulsion from Republican gathering causes uproar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DENVER, COLORADO — Politicians and news outlets in Colorado expressed
anger over the expulsion from a Republican gathering this past weekend
of an experienced politics reporter who was told that the state party
chairman “believes current reporting to be very unfair.” </p>
<p>Journalists and prominent politicians, including the former chair of
the Colorado Republican Party, came to the defense of Colorado Sun
reporter Sandra Fish and against current state Republican Chairman Dave
Williams, who said he had “no apologies” for ejecting Fish. </p>
<p>The controversy follows the contours of attacks on the press
nationally, partly brought on by former President Donald Trump with the
popularization of the term “fake news.” The ejection also appears to
have influenced an endorsement Monday in the Republican primary
race. </p>
<p>The state Republican Party announced on the social media platform X
that it was endorsing U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert over one of her primary
opponent, Deborah Flora, in the state’s 4th Congressional District race,
partly because “Deb Flora lied about participating in the CD4 Assembly
process, &amp; now she’s boot licking fake journalists who only help
Democrats.” </p>
<p>The post was a direct reply to Flora’s post on X defending Fish, in
which Flora said the expulsion was “wrong and a violation of the First
Amendment.” </p>
<p>The chair, who introduces himself on the party’s website as “Dave
‘Let’s Go Brandon’ Williams,” is seeking the nomination to run for the
5th District seat held by Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, who is
retiring from Congress. </p>
<p>In a text, Williams said he had no apologies for kicking Fish out of
the assembly in Pueblo on Saturday and accused her of being a “fake
journalist” and The Colorado Sun of being biased. When asked by text for
examples, Williams did not respond. The Colorado Sun is an independent,
nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet that covers Colorado. </p>
<p>“I invite anyone to share any example of The Colorado Sun or Sandra
Fish being unfair or inaccurate. So far I have heard nothing,” said
Larry Ryckman, editor of the news outlet. “The Founding Fathers weren’t
any big fans of newspapers back in the day. But they understood that a
healthy democracy demands free, unfettered press.” </p>
<p>The assembly, held about two hours south of Denver, was partly to
select representatives to the Republican National Committee and to work
on a party platform for the election. </p>
<p>“There are 900,000 Republicans in the state of Colorado and a lot of
unaffiliated voters who are interested in what happens at this assembly.
And how they find out is via reporters like me being there to cover it,”
Fish told The Associated Press by phone Monday. </p>
<p>“I am, as one person on Twitter noted, a little old lady and I’ve
been in this business for a long time, and I just don’t think it’s right
to eject a reporter from a meeting like this,” said Fish, who has
covered politics since 1982. </p>
<p>Fish said she heard rumors prior to the event that she’d be barred
from attending, and she asked event organizer, Eric Grossman, who texted
her Thursday that he’d get back to her. </p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ve been covering these assemblies for at least seven
cycles and have never had issues before,” Fish texted back. Ryckman
attempted to reach Williams on Thursday night to discuss but said
Williams never responded. </p>
<p>Before dawn on Saturday, Grossman texted Fish saying she wouldn’t be
included on the press list and that “the state chairman believes current
reporting to be very unfair.” </p>
<p>“I went anyway because, come on, this should be an open event,” said
Fish, who was checked in and given press credentials that she wore
around her neck along with a Colorado Sun nametag. </p>
<p>About an hour later, security asked her to leave. Fish showed her
press credentials, then Grossman arrived and soon a sheriff’s deputy was
called. Fish left with the deputy. </p>
<p>“We make no apologies for kicking out a fake journalist, who actually
snuck into our event,” Williams said in a text. “Her publication is just
an extension of the Democrat Party’s PR efforts, and the only backlash
we see is from the fake news media, radical Democrats, and establishment
RINOs who hate our conservative base.” </p>
<p>Grossman, in a text, said Fish’s actions were “a selfish political
stunt.” </p>
<p>Republican state Senator Barbara Kirkmeyer defended the reporter,
writing in a post on X: “Sandra Fish is a fair; honest and respected
reporter, as a Republican I’m embarrassed by the GOP chair.” </p>
<p>Former Colorado Republican Party chair Kristi Burton Brown also
chimed in on X, describing Fish as “hard-hitting but fair. … This is a
dangerous take by the current (Colorado GOP). … Transparency is
necessary for our nation.” </p>
<p>Among other stories, Fish has reported on how the Colorado Republican
Party under Williams’ leadership paid for mailers that subtly attacked
one of Williams’ primary opponents, and that fundraising slowed under
his chairmanship.</p>

id="trump-ex-deputy-weisselberg-sentenced-to-five-months-for-perjury">Trump
ex-deputy Weisselberg sentenced to five months for perjury</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen
Weisselberg was sentenced on Wednesday to five months in jail after
pleading guilty last month to perjury charges for lying to investigators
and a judge about Donald Trump’s finances.</p>
<p>Judge Laurie Peterson handed down the sentence at a hearing in
Manhattan criminal court. The sentence was in line with the punishment
the judge said she would impose at Weisselberg’s March 4 plea hearing.
 </p>
<p>Court officers led Weisselberg out of the courtroom in handcuffs
following a brief hearing. </p>
<p>The sentence marks the second stint behind bars for the former U.S.
president’s longtime loyal deputy.  </p>
<p>Weisselberg, 76, spent around three months in New York’s Rikers
Island jail in 2023 after pleading guilty to participating in a 15-year
tax fraud scheme at the Trump Organization. </p>
<p>The perjury charges stem from Weisselberg’s testimony at a civil
fraud case New York state Attorney General Letitia James brought against
Trump, Weisselberg and other executives at Trump’s family real estate
company for manipulating property values to dupe lenders and
insurers. </p>
<p>Weisselberg testified at the trial on Oct. 10 that he was not
involved in an incorrect valuation of Trump’s Manhattan townhouse.
Trump’s 2015 and 2016 financial statements valued the unit at $327
million based on its stated size of more than 30,000 square feet, nearly
three times the actual size. </p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, which brought the
charges against Weisselberg, said the former CFO’s emails showed he was
in fact paying close attention to the apartment.  </p>
<p>Weisselberg also admitted to lying about his role in Trump’s
financial statements during two earlier depositions with James’ office.
James’ investigation culminated in a $454 million penalty imposed on
Trump for fraudulently valuing properties. Trump is appealing the order
by Justice Arthur Engoron.  </p>
<p>Engoron also ordered Weisselberg to pay $1.1 million including
interest. </p>
<p>Weisselberg worked for the former president’s family for half a
century. His written plea agreement did not indicate if he would be
cooperating with Bragg’s office. </p>
<p>Trump is set to go on trial starting on Monday on criminal charges of
covering up $130,000 in hush money his former lawyer Michael Cohen paid
porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about
a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006. </p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business
records and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is
Stephanie Clifford. </p>
<p>The case, also brought by Bragg, is poised to be the first-ever
criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Trump also faces three other
indictments, which stem from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election
loss and his handling of sensitive government documents. He has pleaded
not guilty to all charges.</p>

id="why-does-part-of-the-windows-98-setup-program-look-older-than-the-rest">“Why
does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the
rest?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing
section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the
Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase,
even though they’re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual).
The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable.
The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the
infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is
what we’re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the
third phase is Windows 98 itself… What do you think the second phase is
running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows
3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a
Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in
SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the
information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including
the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs);
it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it
will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen
Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by
Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny
to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how
Microsoft does things.</p>

They say college is supposed to be the best four years of your life. As
a 17-year-old who was having a hard time in high school because of
severe mental health issues, I felt hope. Four years later, I ask
myself, who actually believes that? To think this is as good as it gets?

That’s the conclusion of many investors this morning, following the

3.5% annually, while central bankers are looking for a figure closer to
2%. We’ll talk through the data. Plus, a European court ruled that two
Russian oligarchs were wrongly sanctioned following Russia’a invasion of
Ukraine. And the Congressional Budget Office found that immigration
means gains for U.S. economy.

<p>For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I
don’t trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working
life dealing with bugs in software. It’s very easy for me to imagine
what could go wrong. I don’t understand how people can trust a computer
with their lives this way. It’s also disconcerting that the car coming
at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when
I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone’s getting a
free demo of FSD, it’s somewhat likely the OP is a computer.</p>

the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.

This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.

Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!

Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.

Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.

We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.

The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>

I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.

When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing and the Factfulness book. Check
out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I gues the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes.

If you are wondering what any of this has to do with climate change,
note that “these synthetic organic chemicals are typically fossil fuel
derivatives,” Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard,
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWQTR-5BhG6BV91vpx5VSRCDW37H_hZ5cKP5vN8Vtb8z3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3mnW3S2_Zx4-sDtfVdg-zJ58pDRtW4_KFJn14VF5MW7h8SMY1xpyzQW4Gvgcj2v9VGKW6_Gx8Y95swykW9hZmN98zKzQhW2gh6q31C5STqW75ht0C3RKLJbW74s7ky7_977QW2dqkpp92-jbNW6N7jgS2trrsGW385dFr1rKKcXN6bTqw-n85G0W4GRt8Y5ft0s2W88WnVy85ptbgW8kNRZb1w2M8_W3X4x493l-HtsN9c_ym87t2qSW2NL_r6284LSHW1KrfJk5z-MfNW2HgX-v6fVNjZW4fsZnj6jcQVDN8_-jGP4-KNCW8qczSt3-K9BvW32mZh_8_LCYCW5BckMw4vLT2wN8wMMJxWx4QvW6s0qpc1qBmW1W2jPc7J3j4n9mf6vdsMW04" target="_blank">explained</a>
to <em><em>Vox</em></em>. “We talk about climate change and chemical
exposure as two separate issues, but we should start thinking about them
together. As we move away from fossil fuel combustion and towards
renewable energy, the industry is going to turn their products into
plastics and synthetic chemicals.”

biggest shift in wildfire management in decades.” It involves creating
more leadership teams – the top-level crewmembers who take on the
biggest and most complex fires – and recruiting a lot of new wildland
firefighters. The Forest Service aims to hire around 11,300 firefighters
this year, <em><em>AP</em></em> reports. While in the past many
firefighting jobs were seasonal, a longer season calls for more
permanent positions. Fire season is already underway. More than 2,669
square miles burned in the first three months of 2024, more than half of
last year’s total.

reduce emissions of several toxic chemicals, but focus heavily on two in
particular that are very likely carcinogenic: ethylene oxide (used as a
sterilizer) and chloroprene (used to make rubber). Manufacturers will
now have to monitor their operations for emissions of these two
substances and stop any leaks they find. They’ll also have to submit
quarterly data from their monitoring efforts, which will be made public,

The value of a typical home has reached $1 million or more in 550 U.S.
cities, according to Zillow. That’s a record high, and those
not-so-affordable homes are proliferating well beyond the usual
high-cost metro areas like New York, San Francisco and LA. Also on the
program: what to expect from today’s consumer price index report and how
a cocktail with roots in wartime propaganda manages to stay relevant.

<p class="drop-caps">
Can capitalism solve climate change? Wrong question, argues the author
and journalist Akshat Rathi: In fact, you can’t solve climate change
<em>without</em> capitalism. Look around the world, as Rathi does in his
new book <em>Climate Capitalism</em>, and he says you’ll find companies
and leaders who are proving that cutting carbon emissions is not just
possible, but also profitable.
</p>
<p>
The venture capitalist Sophie Purdom, the founder of Planeteer Capital,
spends her days looking for those profitable climate companies. She says
that a newer, smarter generation of climate startups is on the way.
</p>
<p>
In this week’s episode, recorded earlier this month live at Princeton
University, Rob and Jesse host a special in-person conversation with
Rathi and Purdom. They talk about the rise of Chinese EVs, what interest
rates mean for the energy transition, and the proper role of policy in
decarbonizing. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor
of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems
engineering.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I guess a question I’d have, maybe, for
both of you is, how much of this is a China story? How much of the
amount of progress that we’ve been able to do is actually because of
Chinese industrial policies — the sheer scale of the Chinese market and
the different incentives that exist on the demand side there to bring
down the cost of solar, or batteries, or any of these technologies that
are now the main engines of decarbonization?<br/><br/><strong>Sophie
Purdom:</strong> I think so much about the supply side of the market,
right? Those solutions and the innovation, which then kind of ideally
ports over, if you succeed, into deployment, which has its own set of
challenges and concerns and capital levers and policy integrations. I’d
argue that the U. S. overall sits further on the supply versus demand
side, relative to a global positioning, and that China’s been playing
the demand side of the game much better. <br/><br/><strong>Akshat Rathi:
</strong>The beauty of wanting to do this book was, to me, watching
these lessons. So if you look at the solar story: invented in America;
really scaled up in Europe, when Germany and Spain were providing a ton
of subsidies for solar manufacturers to put rooftop solar in the early
2000s; and then really scaled up in China when they made a ton more
capital available and just flooded the market, so to
speak.<br/><br/>Take the electric vehicle story, a very different one
because the new energy vehicle policy that made China the biggest maker
and consumer — and now exporter — of electric cars actually takes
inspiration from California’s zero emissions policy. It’s a vehicle
mandate, right? So you have this policy that kind of worked in one
state, forced the rest of America to think about it, but China just
applied it nationwide and ran with it. So you can apply lessons from one
country to another and have policies — one of those beautiful things,
which, it can translate if you can tweak it to work in that political
economy where it needs to operate.<br/><br/><strong>Jesse Jenkins:
</strong>Let’s talk a little bit more about the particular form of
climate capitalism with Chinese characteristics, how this sort of worked
out. There’s a couple of case studies in the book of CATL and BYD and
how they have come about. One of the things I want to underscore is,
we’ve talked about how American-centric we often are. We sort of think,
well, we got to drive all of this. But China increasingly is the world’s
biggest market for all of these solutions, right? For EVs, for solar PV.
They’re also, in many cases, the world’s largest manufacturer. And the
scales are just staggering. <br/><br/>Now, I mean, we in the U.S.
deployed just shy of 40 gigawatts of solar last year, something like 36
to 38 gigawatts. China deployed 280 gigawatts. More than half of the
global market for solar was in China last year. So it’s not … They
started off selling to Spain and Germany, but now, their domestic market
is enormous. You can tell a very similar story about EVs, where more
than half of the market for EVs is in China — increasingly, more than
half of the manufacturing, and now, rapidly, exports too. So what is the
flavor of the capitalism story there?<br/><br/>Because many of these
companies are state-owned enterprises, at least partially, there’s a
strong hand of industrial policy guiding where investment occurs and
making it cheaper, and giving free land, and all kinds of different
things there. But of course, at the end of the day, there is a lot of …
it is in many ways capitalism. There’s a lot of financial motivation
that has led these companies to scale and grow.

<h2 id="carbon-removals-100-billion-conundrum">Carbon Removal’s $100
Billion Conundrum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk2MTQ0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDM4NDA4MX0.negH_EUPaUvtAvIIEJy3fqgcwkE561qCCndZPX_QLTU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Money seems to be pouring into the field of carbon removal from every
direction. Every other week there’s an announcement about a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/carbon-removal-orchard-one-spiritus" target="_self">new
project</a>. Multimillion dollar
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">carbon
removal procurement deals</a> are on the rise. The Department of Energy
is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self">rolling
out grants</a> as part of its $3.5 billion “direct air capture” hubs
program and also funding research and development. Some carbon removal
companies can even start claiming a $130 tax credit for every ton of CO2
they suck up and store underground.
</p>
<p>
The federal government alone spends
<a href="https://carbon180.org/carbon-removal-funding-tracker/#total-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just
under $1 billion per year</a> on carbon removal research, development,
and deployment. According to a
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/carbon-dioxide-removal-us-policy/" target="_blank">new
report</a> from the Rhodium Group, however, the U.S. is going to have to
spend a lot more — roughly <em>$100 billion</em> per year by 2050 — if
carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, is ever going to become a viable climate
solution.
</p>
<p>
“The current level of policy support is nowhere near what’s needed for
CDR to play the role that people say it needs to play in solving climate
change,” Jonathan Larsen, one of the authors, told me. “We wanted to
reset the policy conversation with that in mind.”
</p>
<p>
Carbon removal is what’s implied by the “net” in net-zero — a way to
compensate for whatever polluting activities are going to take longer to
replace with clean solutions. It will be impossible to achieve net-zero
emissions by 2050, either at the national or global level, without
removing carbon from the atmosphere. But how much carbon removal will we
need, and how do we make sure we’re ready to deploy it?
</p>
<p>
These questions are, in a sense, unique to the field. When we talk about
cutting carbon emissions from buildings or transportation, experts are
relatively confident in the set of solutions and the scale of the task —
they know how many buildings and cars there are and can make reasonable
estimates of growth rates.
</p>
<p>
But carbon removal is a moving target. We know how much we’re removing
today — roughly 5 million metric tons, mostly from nature-based
solutions like planting trees. Based on current policies, Rhodium
estimates we could scale that up to about 50 million metric tons by
2035. But figuring out how much we <em>need</em> depends entirely on how
successful we are at decarbonizing everything else. Even if we know we
need to electrify all our cars, for example, no one can say whether that
will happen by 2050, or at least not with any meaningful degree of
certainty.
</p>
<p>
The Rhodium Group report attempts to narrow the range of this
uncertainty so that policymakers can better attack the problem. The
authors looked at a handful of different decarbonization roadmaps for
the U.S. and found that the minimum amount of carbon removal needed to
compensate for residual emissions in 2050 is 1 gigaton, which is the
same as one billion metric tons, or a 20x increase from where current
policies will get us. It’s also equal to about 20% of the carbon that
the U.S. emitted last year. “There’s a very likely scenario where we
need a lot more than that,” said Larsen. “There’s scenarios where we
need less. But most of the studies out there say at least a gigaton.”
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s only a rough estimate, landing on a number is useful, he
told me. Rhodium Group spends a lot of time answering questions about,
for example, what some new policy means for achieving Biden’s goal of
cutting emissions in half by 2030. “I don’t know if we’d get those
questions if there wasn’t a 50% target to shoot for,” he said. “So I
think this way, people can be like, what does this next wave of policy
support for CDR do for getting the U.S. on track for a gigaton?”
</p>
<p>
The level of investment it will take to get there is also highly
uncertain. The authors did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to
land on $100 billion by 2050: We need to be removing a minimum of one
billion tons by then, and the Department of Energy has
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
goal to bring the cost of carbon removal down</a> to $100 per ton.
</p>
<p>
The meat of the new report focuses on how to bridge the gap between the
roughly $1 billion we spend today and $100 billion, which starts,
according to the authors, with treating carbon removal as a public
service. It’s not like other climate solutions such as wind turbines or
heat pumps, they write, which can rely on private markets to provide
predictable demand or to stimulate innovation. “There are very few
pathways one can envision where the private sector is going to both
scale and deliver those tons,” Larsen told me. Voluntary carbon removal
purchases by companies could play a role, he said, but it will not be
big enough to get to a gigaton.
</p>
<p>
Rhodium recommends expanding and extending many of the federal policy
programs that already exist — by, for example, providing more R&amp;D
funding, doing more
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self">government
procurement</a>, handing out more loan guarantees, and creating more
“hubs” centered on other approaches besides direct air capture, like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self">enhanced
weathering</a> or biomass burial. Right now, the tax credit for
capturing carbon from the air and burying it underground can only be
claimed for 12 years, and projects have to start construction by 2032.
The authors call for extending the claim period and moving up the
construction start deadline. They also recommend expanding the program
to apply to a wider range of carbon removal methods.
</p>
<p>
A common criticism of government support for carbon removal is that
policy makers will over-rely on it. If we aim to do 1 gigaton of carbon
removal, does that mean we won’t cut emissions as much as we could have?
What happens if, for whatever reason, we can’t achieve the 1 gigaton?
</p>
<p>
Larsen disagreed with that framing. For one, it’s easy to turn it
around: If we don’t scale up the capacity to remove carbon, and we also
don’t eliminate emissions by mid-century, we’re not even going to have
the option to halt climate change at that point.
</p>
<p>
But also, decarbonization shouldn’t stop in 2050, he said. If we can
achieve that 1 gigaton of annual removal and then keep cutting emissions
from remaining sources, we could eventually get to net-<em>negative</em>
emissions — even without more CDR. In other words, if we reach a point
where we’re removing more than we’re emitting, we could start to reverse
global warming, not just stop it.
</p>
<p>
“I know that’s, like, sci-fi,” he told me. “But that’s ultimately where
we as a species have to go and that’s why setting a target here of at
least a gigaton, to me, does not take away the need to reduce
elsewhere.”

<h2 id="on-video-podcasts">On video podcasts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://robhope.com/&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yo.fm/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It started way back in 2019—damn time flies—and season 3 just started. If you’re into tech/design give it a listen. But Rob’s podcast is just the excuse I needed to complain about something I find quite annoying: video podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Season 3 of Yo! is “video first”. Podcasts switching to video to be on
YouTube ranks quite high on the list of things that I find annoying. I
get why they’re doing it. I’m not an idiot. Yet I still find it
annoying. Especially because podcasts that were audio-only would start
referencing and talking about things that are “on the screen right now”
and now I’m missing out on parts of the conversation because I’m
listening to a podcast while I’m driving.
</p>
<p>
Video podcasts are the worst of both worlds. They’re not as good as
actual video content designed to be consumed exclusively as video and
they’re inferior to audio-only podcasts. And if you disagree

id="house-to-delay-sending-mayorkas-impeachment-articles-to-senate">House
to delay sending Mayorkas impeachment articles to Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson will delay sending the House’s
articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas to the Senate this week as planned after Republican senators
requested more time Tuesday to build support for holding a full
trial.</p>
<p>The sudden change of plans cast fresh doubts on the proceedings, the
historic first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary in roughly 150 years.
Seeking to rebuke the Biden administration’s handling of the southern
border, House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February but delayed
sending the articles while they finished work on government funding
legislation.</p>
<p>Johnson had planned to send the impeachment charges to the Senate on
Wednesday evening. But as it became clear that Democrats, who hold the
majority of the chamber, had the votes to quickly dismiss them, Senate
Republicans requested that Johnson delay until next week. They hoped the
tactic would prolong the process.</p>
<p>While Republicans argued Tuesday that forgoing a full Senate trial
would break precedent, most Senate Republicans voted to do just that
when Donald Trump, the former president, was impeached a second time on
charges he incited an insurrection in the January 6, 2021, attack on the
Capitol. Their effort to halt the proceedings failed. Trump was
ultimately acquitted in the Senate trial.</p>
<p>“Our members want to have an opportunity not only to debate but also
to have some votes on issues they want to raise,” said South Dakota
Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican Senate leader. Under
procedural rules, senators are required to convene as jurors the day
after the articles of impeachment are transmitted for a trial.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y., who has decried the
impeachment push as a sham, suggested Democrats still plan to deal with
the charges quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to go whenever they are. We are sticking with our plan.
We’re going to move this as expeditiously as possible,” Schumer
said.</p>
<p>“Impeachment should never be used to settle policy disagreements,” he
told reporters earlier Tuesday.</p>
<p>House Republicans charged in two articles of impeachment that
Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached
the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was
secure.</p>
<p>Democrats — and a few Republicans — say the charges amount to a
policy dispute, not the Constitution’s bar of high crimes and
misdemeanors.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, I think it’s virtually certain that there will not be
the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been
met,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.</p>
<p>Still, with elections approaching, Republicans want to force Congress
to grapple with the Biden administration’s handling of the southern
border as long as possible.</p>
<p>“I think there are a lot of Democrats who really want to avoid the
vote. I don’t blame them. I mean, this is the number one issue on the
minds of Americans,” Thune said.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid
in Ohio, pointed to Republican senators rejecting a bipartisan deal
aimed at tamping down the number of illegal border crossings from
Mexico.</p>
<p>“Instead of doing this impeachment — the first one in 100 years — why
are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?” Brown said.</p>
<p>Before Mayorkas, only one U.S. Cabinet official had ever been
impeached. Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. A House
investigation found evidence that he had received kickback payments
while administering government contracts.</p>

Navy leaders seek cooperation with US at annual exposition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Taiwan Navy Commander Admiral Tang Hua said during a
trip to Maryland that the self-governing island wants more cooperation
with the U.S. and other countries amid military pressure from China.</p>
<p>But as to whether or not he would hold direct talks with U.S. Chief
of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti, as reported by Reuters,
Tang said he would not comment so as to avoid China’s protest causing
trouble to the U.S. side.</p>
<p>Speaking to VOA on Monday at this year’s Sea-Air-Space Conference
hosted by the Navy League of the U.S. at National Harbor, outside of
Washington, Tang said he would meet with navy personnel from the U.S.
and other countries.</p>
<p>“I think the People’s Liberation Army’s problem with Taiwan is not
just about Taiwan,” he said. “It may be in the East China Sea or the
South China Sea. It is a global issue, not an issue specifically
targeting Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Taiwan split from China in 1949 after the nationalists lost to the
communists and fled to the island, where they established a government
that eventually became a democracy.</p>
<p>China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province that must one day reunite
with the mainland, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea
and claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in
conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam.</p>
<p>The U.S. supports a “One China” policy that Beijing is the only
recognized government of China while maintaining non-diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and vowing to defend its right to
self-governance.</p>
<p>In response to a Reuters question at a briefing March 29 about the
Taiwan Navy chief’s trip to the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Lin Jian said China firmly opposes “military collusion between the U.S.
and Taiwan.”</p>
<p>He urged the U.S. to “immediately stop official interactions and
military contact with Taiwan, and refrain from sending any wrong message
to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces.”</p>
<p>Tang said other countries’ navies at the conference were also looking
to partner up.</p>
<p>“Not only are the U.S. military, but also the navies of various
countries here. In fact, regarding much of our current cooperation, you
just heard them talk about many things, including manpower issues,
shipbuilding issues, and demand and cooperation, so I think on these
occasions, everyone is seeking opportunities for cooperation and
integration,” he said.</p>
<p>Tang, along with Rear Admiral Chung-Hsing Wei, defense attache with
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., and
the visiting Taiwan delegation attended meetings and speeches of naval
leaders from the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>He also visited the booths of major U.S. military manufacturers at
the exhibition, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, and inquired
about weapons and equipment with companies that have procurement
projects with Taiwan.</p>
<p>This included General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produced
four MQ-9B “SkyGuardian” drones for Taipei.</p>
<p>A senior official from the company also told him that he will join a
U.S. Taiwan Business Council delegation to visit Taiwan in early
June.</p>

id="us-pushes-back-at-russias-protest-over-south-korean-sanctions">US
pushes back at Russia’s protest over South Korean sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is welcoming South Korean sanctions
imposed on Russian vessels suspected of transporting weapons from North
Korea, despite Russian protests. </p>
<p>“We applaud the recent actions taken by the ROK to disrupt and expose
arms transfers between the DPRK and Russia – including the sanctions …
on two Russian vessels involved in arms transfers to Russia,” a State
Department spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“It is important for the international community to send a strong,
unified message that the DPRK must halt its irresponsible behavior,
abide by its obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and
engage in serious and sustained diplomacy,” the spokesperson said Friday
via email to the VOA Korean Service.</p>
<p>South Korea on April 2 unilaterally sanctioned two Russian vessels
involved in delivering military supplies from North Korea to Russia.
 </p>
<p>The next day at a press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Maria Zakharova called Seoul’s move “an unfriendly step”
that “leads only to escalation of tensions” and “will affect South
Korea-Russia relations in a negative way.” </p>
<p>She said Moscow would respond to the sanctions but did not specify
how. </p>
<p>On Friday, Russia said it had summoned South Korea’s ambassador.
 </p>
<p>The South Korean sanctions followed Russia’s veto of a U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for the annual extension of the U.N. experts
panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea. The panel’s mandate ends
at the end of April.</p>
<p>The ties between Pyongyang and Moscow have been growing since a
summit in September. Since then, North Korea has been providing
munitions that Russia needs to fight its war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The ROK government getting involved in applying sanctions, seizures,
and other active counterproliferation authorities and capabilities
against the North is a huge step forward in joint cooperation to
counter, protect and contain the DPRK regime’s weapons exports,” said
David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.   </p>
<p>Asher worked on disrupting North Korea’s illicit financial, trading
and weapons of mass destruction networks under the George W. Bush
administration.</p>
<p>In an email to VOA on Monday, Asher added, “I fully expect
ROK-U.S.-Japan cooperation to expand in counterproliferation, including
the identification and targeting of weapons supply networks using
intelligence operations, law enforcement, and sanctions.”</p>
<p>A day after announcing the sanctions, Seoul said it had seized a
vessel that was suspected of violating U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
South Korea said it was investigating the DEYI, a cargo ship that was en
route to Russia from North Korea via China, after seizing it in waters
off the South Korean port city of Yeosu.</p>
<p>“This reinforces that countries can implement U.N. sanctions, on
their own, as they have responsibility to do so,” especially after
Russia blocked the U.N. experts panel’s mandate, said Anthony Ruggiero,
senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ruggiero has
over 19 years working on financial sanctions and proliferation issues,
including ones involving North Korea.</p>
<p>There is a broad international and domestic set of legal authorities
that countries like South Korea could rely on to go after illicit
exports and maritime activities by North Korea, but it is a matter of
“whether countries are willing to stop” vessels making illegal actions,
Ruggiero said during a telephone interview on Monday. </p>
<p>A U.N. Security Council resolution passed in 2017 authorizes member
states to seize, inspect, freeze and impound vessels in their
territorial waters found to be conducting illicit activities with
Pyongyang and carrying banned goods from North Korea.  </p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Thursday
that the U.S. is “coordinating closely with the ROK in its investigation
of this ship in connection with U.N. sanctions violations.”</p>
<p>“Despite Russia’s veto of the 1718 Committee Panel of Experts mandate
in order to bury reporting on its violation of U.S. Security Council
resolutions, U.N. sanctions on the DPRK remain in place, and all U.N.
member states are still required to implement them,” the spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., said
Monday that U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will
travel to South Korea and Japan next week to discuss ways to monitor
international sanctions on North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea estimated in March that North Korea has shipped about
7,000 containers full of munitions to Russia since last year. The U.S.
assessed the same month the number of containers to be 10,000.</p>
<p>Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington who helped draft the
Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act in 2016, told VOA on Monday via
email that Seoul could seize ships carrying weapons from North Korea to
Russia if certain criteria are met. </p>
<p>Seoul could do so “if South Korea has reasonable cause to believe
that the vessel is engaged in sanctions evasion, and if one of the
following conditions is also met: the [vessel’s] flag state consents,
the vessel is stateless, or the ship enters a South Korean port.”</p>

<h2 id="deep-bug">Deep Bug</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime
February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly
the code that merges partial indices. In short the search engine
constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller
indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement. You can
conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset
pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs
after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has
a run time of about 4 hours.</p>

id="ixsystems-focusing-on-linux-makes-more-sense-than-freebsd">iXsystems:
focusing on Linux makes more sense than FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we talked about how iXsystems, the company behind
TrueNAS CORE and SCALE, has all but confirmed that its FreeBSD-based
CORE product will be put in maintenance mode, while the Linux-based
SCALE product will get all the attention and focus from here on out. In
an interview with Blocks &amp; Files, the company gave more insight into
this choice. “We had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time
improving FreeBSD as opposed to working on features and functionalities.
What’s happened now with the transition to having a Debian basis, the
people I used to have 90 percent of their time working on FreeBSD,
they’re working on ZFS features now … That’s what I want to see; value
add for everybody versus sitting around, implementing something Linux
had a years ago. And trying to maintain or backport, or just deal with
something that you just didn’t get out of box on FreeBSD.” “It’s not
knocking against FreeBSD. We love it. That’s our heritage. That’s our
roots, I was on the CORE team elected twice. So believe me, if I felt
like I could have stayed on FreeBSD for the next 20 years, I would have
absolutely preferred to do that … But at some point, you gotta read the
writing on the wall and say, well, all the the vendor
supported-innovations are happening on the Linux side these days.” BSD
aficionados don’t like this change. Moore said: “Talk is cheap and
complaints are free. You know, everyone loves to complain about it. But
… if people wanted to push FreeBSD forward for the last 15 years, they
would have.” ↫ Chris Mellor at Blocks &amp; Files Above all else, my
personal north star is choice, especially in technology, and as such, I
want iXsystems to keep focusing on FreeBSD so that not everyone is using
Linux for server- and server-like workloads. The fact that TrueNAS was a
FreeBSD-based product for this long was amazing, and I would definitely
have preferred if it stayed that way for many, many more years to come.
However, I don’t think the people of TrueNAS are saying anything wrong
or outrageous here. They’ve got employees to feed, and the money is in
Linux, not FreeBSD. If they spend more money, time, and resources on
getting FreeBSD on par with features Linux has had for ages than on
actually developing their own product – TrueNAS – then they’re fighting
a losing battle. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s taken them this long to
take this controversial step. All we can hope for is that the things
they work on, the features they develop, will make it to FreeBSD
regardless.</p>

That AI PC pixie dust doesn’t seem to be working its magic just yet as
shipments were up for the first quarter of this year, but only by a few
percent. But rising prices mean those who do buy will likely pay more to

Postal Service seeks to hike stamp prices to 73 cents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States Postal Service (USPS) said on Tuesday
it wants to raise the price of first-class mail stamps to 73 cents from
68 cents effective July 14.</p>
<p>The proposal, which must be approved by the Postal Regulatory
Commission, would raise mailing services product prices by 7.8%.</p>
<p>USPS in November reported a $6.5 billion net loss for the 12 months
ending Sept. 30 as first-class mail fell to the lowest volume since
1968. Stamp prices are up 36% over the last four years since early 2019
when they were 50 cents.</p>
<p>USPS has been aggressively hiking stamp prices and is in the middle
of a 10-year restructuring plan announced in 2021 that aims to eliminate
$160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade and had previously
forecast 2023 as a breakeven year.</p>
<p>USPS has been raising stamp prices twice yearly and has said it
expects its “new pricing policy to generate $44 billion in additional
revenue” by 2031.</p>
<p>A number of lawmakers have raised concerns about USPS planned changes
to its processing and delivery network that could impact timely
deliveries.</p>
<p>First-class mail volume fell 6.1% in the 12 months ending Sept. 30,
2023, to 46 billion pieces and is down 53% since 2006 – to the lowest
volume since 1968 – but revenue increased by $515 million because of
higher stamp prices.</p>

<h2 id="beeper-leaves-beta-acquired-by-automattic">Beeper leaves beta,
acquired by Automattic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you haven’t already heard of Beeper, welcome! Beeper is a
universal chat app for Android, iOS and desktop. Our goal is to build
the best chat app on earth. Beeper is built on an open source chat
protocol called Matrix. Over time, we’ll help people migrate from
proprietary, siloed chat networks to an open standard for chat. If
you’re interested in learning about this, we’ve written more about our
intentions. ↫ Beeper team Beeper is just great. Because I’m European and
have ties to two different countries with vastly different chat
preferences, as well as a number of friends living all over Europe and
the US, I’ve always had to deal with at least four different instant
messaging applications. Beeper, and especially the recent completely
redesigned Android version, is so good and seamless that I no longer
need to use the individual applications at all. It’s not perfect – the
new Android version (the iOS version is old and outdated compared to the
Android one) still has some issues. If you receive a video and play it,
it doesn’t maximise unless you perform a very delicate zoom in pinch.
Sometimes, sending video fails. Some emoji replies on some services look
huge and pixellated. I’m sure these are all relatively low-hanging fruit
types of bugs that’ll get fixes over the coming weeks and months now
that the application is out of beta. However, the actual core of the
application has been working amazingly well for me. Beeper also has
another major announcement. I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been
acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an
exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat
app on earth. ↫ Eric Migicovsky Automattic is the company behind
WordPress, Tumblr, Pocket Casts, and a whole load of other products and
services. Beeper seems like a good fit, since Automattic recently also
acquired Texts.com, another multi-platform messaging client.</p>

<h2 id="us-defense-chief-denies-genocide-committed-in-gaza">US defense
chief denies genocide committed in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Pentagon is not backing off on its support for
Israel, despite growing frustration by some U.S. lawmakers that Israel
is crossing ethical lines as it goes after Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>During a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday
interrupted multiple times by protesters accusing Israel — and the
United States — of having innocent blood on its hands, Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin pushed back.</p>
<p>Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, asked Austin: “Is Israel committing
genocide in Gaza?”</p>
<p>Austin replied: “Senator Cotton, we don’t have any evidence of
genocide.”</p>
<p>But under repeated questioning, Austin acknowledged Israel’s military
can and must do more to differentiate between Hamas militants and
civilians.</p>
<p>“There’s no question that there have been far too many civilian
casualties in this conflict,” he said.</p>
<p>Austin said he has warned his Israeli counterpart that a failure to
allow the delivery of much more humanitarian aid to Gaza “would just
create more terrorism.”</p>
<p>As for continued talk by Israel about an operation to root out Hamas
in Rafah, the secretary of defense was blunt. “It cannot be what we’ve
seen in the past in terms of the type of activities that we’ve seen in
Gaza City and in Khan Yunis,” he said.</p>
<p>Not all lawmakers were satisfied with those answers. Some expressed
frustration that Washington has been forced to step in.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason the United States should have to build a pier in
the eastern Mediterranean. There’s no reason we should have to airdrop
supplies,” said Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat. “The pace of humanitarian
aid is insufficient.”</p>
<p>Other lawmakers put blame on Hamas. Austin agreed that the
U.S.-designated terror group’s ongoing conduct continues to amount to
war crimes.</p>
<p>The hearing was about President Joe Biden’s budget request for the
Department of Defense.</p>

id="governor-congress-members-to-meet-over-support-for-rebuilding-bridge">Governor,
Congress members to meet over support for rebuilding bridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANNAPOLIS, Maryland — Maryland Governor Wes Moore said he plans to
meet with members of Congress this week to discuss support for
rebuilding the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, which has blocked the
main shipping channel at Baltimore’s port for nearly two weeks. </p>
<p>“I’m going to be spending part of this week with our delegation going
down and meeting with leaders and ranking members in the Congress and
letting them know that this issue is not partisan. This is a patriotic
responsibility to be able to support one of this country’s great
economic engines,” Moore said Monday. “This is an opportunity to support
a port that is directly responsible for the hiring of tens of thousands
of people.” </p>
<p>As Maryland lawmakers reached the end of their legislative session
Monday, a measure authorizing use of the state’s rainy-day fund to help
port employees was approved and sent to Moore’s desk. The governor
planned to sign the emergency legislation Tuesday, putting it into
effect right away. </p>
<p>The bridge collapsed March 26 after being struck by the cargo ship
Dali, which lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore, bound for Sri
Lanka. The ship issued a mayday alert with just enough time for police
to stop traffic, but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes
on the bridge. </p>
<p>Authorities believe six workers — immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador — plunged to their deaths in the Patapsco
River. Two others survived. The bodies of three workers have been
recovered, but the search for the other victims continues. </p>
<p>Moore said the state remains focused on supporting the families of
the six workers. </p>
<p>“We are still very much focused on bringing closure and comfort to
these families, and the operations to be able to bring that closure to
these families,” Moore said. “It has not stopped. It continues to be a
24/7 operation.” </p>
<p>Temporary, alternate channels have been cleared, and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers said last week that it expects to open a
limited-access channel for barge container ships and some vessels moving
cars and farm equipment by the end of April. Officials are aiming to
restore normal capacity to Baltimore’s port by the end of May. </p>
<p>Moore was upbeat about progress in reopening channels. </p>
<p>He said that if he had been told the morning of the collapse that
there would be two channels open in two weeks, “I would have said that
sounds really ambitious, considering what we saw, but that’s where we
are.” </p>
<p>The governor also spoke of progress in removing debris, saying crews
pulled 318 metric tons (350 tons) of steel from the Patapsco River on
Sunday. </p>
<p>More than 50 salvage divers and 12 cranes are on site to help cut
sections of the bridge and remove them from the key waterway. Crews
began removing containers from the deck over the weekend, and they’re
making progress toward removing sections of the bridge that lie across
the ship’s bow so it can eventually move, according to the Key Bridge
Response Unified Command.</p>

id="arizona-can-enforce-an-1864-law-criminalizing-nearly-all-abortions-court-says">Arizona
can enforce an 1864 law criminalizing nearly all abortions, court
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — The Arizona Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state can
enforce its long-dormant law criminalizing all abortions except when a
mother’s life is at stake.</p>
<p>The case examined whether the state is still subject to a law that
predates Arizona’s statehood. The 1864 law provides no exceptions for
rape or incest but allows abortions if a mother’s life is in danger. The
state’s high court ruling reviewed a 2022 decision by the state Court of
Appeals that said doctors couldn’t be charged for performing the
procedure in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>An older court decision blocked enforcing the 1864 law shortly after
the U.S. Supreme Court issued the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing
a constitutional right to an abortion. After the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, then state Attorney General Mark
Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge in Tucson to lift the
block on enforcing the 1864 law.</p>
<p>Brnovich’s Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, had
urged the state’s high court to side with the Court of Appeals and hold
the 1864 law in abeyance. Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision
ending a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states
have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most
Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.</p>
<p>Currently, 14 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of
pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Two states ban the procedure once
cardiac activity can be detected, which is about six weeks into
pregnancy and often before women realize they’re pregnant.</p>
<p>Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have
blocked enforcing some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy
in Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>A proposal pending before the Arizona Legislature that would repeal
the 1864 law hasn’t received a committee hearing this year.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision to reimpose a law from a time when Arizona wasn’t a
state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn’t even vote will go
down in history as a stain on our state,” Mayes said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The justices said the state can start enforcing the law in 14 days.
Former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who signed the state’s current law
restricting abortion after 15 weeks, posted on X saying Tuesday’s ruling
was not the outcome he would have wanted.</p>
<p>“I signed the 15-week law as governor because it is thoughtful
policy, and an approach to this very sensitive issue that Arizonans can
actually agree on,” he said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden called the 1864 Arizona law cruel.</p>
<p>“Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and
dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their
health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest,” he said in a
statement. “Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of
Americans who support a woman’s right to choose. We will continue to
fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law
restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade.”</p>

details privacy and security features of its new Find My Device
network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday, I posted an item about the updated Find My Device network
Google launched for Android, but I forgot to link to an additional blog
post by Google about the various security and privacy precautions
they’ve taken. One aspect in particular stands out as something new that
Apple’s Find My network doesn’t do (yet): This is a first-of-its-kind
safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location,
like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network
requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before
reporting its location to the tag’s owner. Our research found that the
Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes
and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By
implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner,
the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion
Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their
lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from
unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known
location and Nest finding are reliable ways to locate items. ↫ Dave
Kleidermacher In addition, when you’re at home, your devices won’t
contribute any information either. There’s a whole bunch of other things
in there, too, so head on over if you’re curious.</p>

id="biden-kishida-summit-aims-for-deeper-more-regionally-integrated-us-japan-security-ties">Biden-Kishida
summit aims for deeper, more regionally integrated US-Japan security
ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Joe Biden is set to welcome Japanese Prime
Minister Fumio Kishida to the White House Tuesday evening for an
official visit that will mark one of the biggest structural upgrades of
the U.S.-Japan security alliance in several decades.</p>
<p>The visit will also usher in Tokyo’s further integration into
Washington’s security framework with other allies in the region, a key
factor to deter Beijing.</p>
<p>The visit will “highlight the high ambition of our alliance,” said
national security adviser Jake Sullivan during a White House briefing
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden and Kishida will announce measures to enhance “defense and
security cooperation to enable greater coordination and integration of
our forces and ensure that they’re optimally postured and linked to
other like-minded partners,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“There will be major deliverables on space as we lead the way on
space exploration and returning to the moon,” he added. “There will be
announcements of significant research partnerships between our leading
institutions on critical and emerging technologies such as AI
[artificial intelligence], quantum semiconductors, and clean
energy.”</p>
<p>The measures announced will first time will allow the United States
and Japan to collaborate more closely on the development and potentially
co-production of vital military and defense equipment, said Deputy
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in a recent event hosted by the Center
for a New American Security.</p>
<p>It’s a milestone in the U.S. alliance with Japan, what Campbell
describes as the “cornerstone of our engagement in the
Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plan is set to declare their intention to modernize a framework
that has for decades guided interaction between Japan’s Self-Defense
Forces and the approximately 54,000 U.S. troops in Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo wants the U.S. military to strengthen the functions of its
command headquarters in Japan to allow for better coordination. Under
the current system, major decisions are coordinated with the U.S.
military’s Indo-Pacific Command, located more than 6,000 kilometers
(3,728 miles) and five time zones away in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Under its new national security strategy, Japan is establishing a
joint operational command for its self-defense force, said Tetsuo
Kotani, senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International
Affairs.</p>
<p>“In that sense we have done our homework and now it’s time for the
United States to upgrade their command-and-control structure in the
Indo-Pacific,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Broader regional frameworks</p>
<p>The leaders agree on the goal of expanding bilateral security ties
into broader regional frameworks with other U.S. allies, including the
Philippines and Australia.</p>
<p>The pair will be joined later this week by Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a summit set to bolster trilateral maritime
cooperation in the South China Sea. An announcement on some form of
trilateral joint naval patrol activity is widely expected.</p>
<p>Sullivan confirmed to VOA the widely expected announcement of
trilateral joint naval patrols, a move that is likely to trigger a
strong reaction from Beijing.</p>
<p>“We just saw ‘trilateral plus Australia’ new form of quadrilateral
joint naval patrols last week, so you can expect to see more of that in
the future,” he said.</p>
<p>Beyond bolstering naval defense amid Beijing’s ramped-up aggression
in the South China Sea, Tokyo has signaled it wants to link Japan into a
broader integrated air and missile defense network with the U.S. and
Australia.</p>
<p>“Pushing ahead on cooperation with like-minded countries on security,
including defense equipment and technology, will lead to the
establishment of a multilayered network, and by expanding that we can
improve deterrence,” Kishida said Friday.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulties of integrating such systems, talks will
likely begin with establishing greater situational awareness among the
three countries for their individual air and missile defenses, said
Jeffrey Hornung, the Japan Lead for the RAND National Security Research
Division and a senior political scientist at RAND.</p>
<p>“Any cooperation on this front will help dilute Chinese anti-access,
area denial efforts by enabling the three countries to pass information
on Chinese activities,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Japan’s AUKUS role</p>
<p>In response to VOA’s question, Sullivan also confirmed the pair will
discuss Japan’s potential involvement in AUKUS, a trilateral security
partnership formed in 2021 among the U.S., Australia and the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>“We’re prepared to work with additional partners beyond the three of
us, where they can bring capabilities,” Sullivan said. “Japan is one of
the countries that could very well bring capabilities to that, so we
will explore a partnership with Japan under Pillar II of AUKUS as well
as other partners.”</p>
<p>In a joint statement  published Tuesday by the British government,
the group said they are “considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS
Pillar II advanced capability projects,” in recognition of Japan’s
strengths and its close bilateral defense partnerships with all three
countries.</p>
<p>“Pillar II” of AUKUS is focused on delivering advanced capabilities
and sharing technologies across a range of areas including quantum
computing, undersea, hypersonic, artificial intelligence and cyber
technology. The step takes the group’s effort to push back against China
beyond its first pillar – delivery of nuclear-powered attack submarines
to Australia, for which there are no known plans to include Japan.</p>
<p>Any multinational defense industrial partnership is an extremely
complicated endeavor, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program
at the Stimson Center.</p>
<p>Many aspects need to be harmonized, from industrial security
standards and export licensing regulations to the arrangement on
intellectual property rights, she told VOA. “Making it a reality will
take many months of careful consultation among all four countries.”</p>
<p>  Nippon Steel</p>
<p>A potential rift remains between Biden and Kishida over the proposed
sale of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan, a deal
that has become embroiled in protectionist campaign rhetoric ahead of
the November U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Last month Biden announced his opposition to the deal, saying the
U.S. needs to “maintain strong American steel companies powered by
American steelworkers.” His prospective opponent, former President
Donald Trump, has promised to block the $14 billion deal if he is
elected again.</p>
<p>The optics of a Japanese firm trying to buy an American manufacturing
company during an election year is bad for Biden, Tatsumi said, and the
pair will want to avoid airing their differences publicly.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday event hosted by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel sought to
downplay the impact of Biden’s opposition to the U.S. Steel acquisition
to the relationship.</p>
<p>He noted that in February the Biden administration approved a plan
that would drive billions of dollars in revenue to a U.S.-based
subsidiary of the Japanese company Mitsui for crane production in the
United States.</p>
<p>Kishida and Japanese first lady Yuko Kishida will be briefly welcomed
at the White House on Tuesday evening ahead of Wednesday’s official
visit and formal state dinner, the fifth that Biden will have hosted
since taking office in 2021.</p>

Kathleen Pryer did not watch March Madness this year.
</p>
<p>
That isn’t unusual in and of itself — Pryer describes herself as “not a
basketball person,” though that might still raise a few eyebrows this
time of year at Duke University, her place of employment. But the
professor of biology has been a bit distracted lately. For the past few
months, she’s been on defense, fending off a
<a href="https://goduke.com/news/2024/3/31/mens-basketball-duke-falls-to-nc-state-76-64-in-elite-eight.aspx" target="_blank">loss</a>
of her own: the pending closure of the school’s herbarium.
</p>
<p>
A herbarium (or plural, <em>herbaria</em>) is a collection of preserved
plants, typically dried and mounted on sheets of rigid paper. The oldest
existing collection in the world, the Gherardo Cibo herbarium in Rome,
dates back to the mid 1500s; many U.S. collections are well over a
century old. Browsing
<a href="https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/vh/specimen-list/?ColProjectsLocal_tab=Spring%20Flora%20of%20New%20York" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">digitized
herbaria</a> online, one can easily get sucked in by their unintended
whimsy; though the preserved plants are scientific specimens,
traditionally collected by botanists to be used in the study of taxonomy
during Western biology’s
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/every-living-thing-the-great-and-deadly-race-to-know-all-life-jason-roberts/20162521?ean=9781984855206" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">golden
age of naming things</a>, the pages remind me more of the pale,
beautiful botanical illustrations in my childhood copy of
<em>Thumbelina</em>.
</p>
<p>
Duke’s herbarium turns 103 this year and contains 825,000 specimens,
making it
<a href="https://herbarium.duke.edu/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one
of the largest</a> collections in the country. But back in mid-February,
Susan Alberts, Duke’s dean of natural sciences, sent an email to Pryer,
who curates the herbarium, and four other associated faculty members to
inform them that “it’s in the best interests of both Duke and the
herbarium to find a new home or homes for these collections.”
</p>
<p>
Though there had long been rumblings about the future of Duke’s
herbarium —
<a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2024/02/duke-university-timeline-decision-to-close-duke-herbarium-reveals-limited-communication-over-multiple-years-backlash-closure-specimens" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls
for “strategic plans,” hand-wringing about funds</a>, worry about hiring
new staff — the news came as both a shock and a slap in the face to the
faculty, chief among them Pryer. “It’s some kind of little stinky plot,”
she told me, adding, “I didn’t just roll over when it happened. I
reached out to absolutely everybody I could think of.”
</p>
<p>
The news of Duke’s herbarium closure ricocheted through the tight-knit
natural sciences community. Mason Heberling, an associate curator in the
Section of Botany at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, told me it
should be a “wake-up call” for other researchers. The Duke herbarium is
prestigious and hardly a “languishing collection,” he explained;
researchers and faculty can easily slip into taking their herbaria for
granted. “I’ve realized now that a huge part of my job as a curator will
need to be explaining why these collections are important,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly, botanists and curators came to Duke’s defense. Opinion pieces
and quotes decrying Duke’s decision appeared in
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/science/duke-herbarium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
pages of <em>The New York Times</em></a> and
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/tragic-mistake-decision-close-duke-university-s-herbarium-triggers-furor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Science</em></a><em>.
</em>A petition went up on Change.org
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/urge-duke-university-to-reconsider-closing-their-herbarium" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urging
the school</a> to reconsider its decision. Online fora burbled with
discontent. “This may be the single worst thing to ever happen to
Southeastern botany,”
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/1aqmpx2/duke_university_is_eliminating_its_herbarium_the/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one
post on Reddit read</a>, with 64 additional comments piling on the
administration for being “profit-obsessed business assholes.” “They
could probably fund the entire thing with the salary of one head
[basketball] coach,” grumbled another commenter.
</p>
<p>
The criticism of Duke’s decision is rooted in both a romantic nostalgia
about herbaria — the same way you might feel fondly about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/bellerby-co-globemakers-globe-art" target="_self">hand-painted
globes</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cabinets
of curiosities</a> — and a very modern sense of scientific urgency.
Researchers have only recently started leveraging the collections as
invaluable pieces of data in the greater picture of climate change.
“Herbaria are, in many ways, one of our best places to understand nature
across space, time, and species,” Charles Davis, the curator of vascular
plants at the nation’s largest private herbaria, at Harvard University,
told me. “These collections are snapshots of events and occurrences in
space and time that you just can’t easily replicate anywhere else. In
fact, I would argue it’s impossible.”
</p>
<p>
Think of it this way: Worldwide, there are about 3,600 herbaria located
in 193 different countries that collectively hold about 400 million
specimens. Botanists
<a href="https://mailchi.mp/9463db60c43d/a-feast-for-the-curious-issue-24?e=ed37ea3859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimate</a>
as much as <em>half</em> of the planet’s undiscovered flora could be
found in herbaria backlogs. Barbara Thiers, the editor of the
<a href="https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2a6wBhCVARIsABPeH1uUaSLsEOjmNHHMb7v3bRu6V0FpyXqIVVNEaH-xl3_p2_9OQJML2J4aAmZ1EALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Index
Herbariorum</em></a>, a digital guide to the world’s collections, told
me that when she was the director of the New York Botanical Garden
Herbarium, “we had a huge room filled with unidentified species; I think
there were 35,000 or 40,000 specimens in there.” That wasn’t for lack of
effort — Thiers said that for many of the plant groups, there simply
aren’t any working experts or published literature for curators to
consult.
</p>
<p>
Because the climate is changing so fast, many plants in herbaria will go
extinct before they’re formally discovered and named, a process known as
a “dark extinction.” “It’s a very sobering feeling to touch the leaves
of a tree that doesn’t exist anymore,” Erin Zimmerman, an evolutionary
biologist and author of the forthcoming book
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781685890704" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Unrooted:
Botany, Motherhood, and the Fight to Save an Old Science</em></a>, told
me, recalling coming across such a specimen in an herbarium while doing
her own research. She likened herbaria to a library, but in her
description I also heard echoes of a church: “The specimens are
sometimes very old; you have to be very gentle with them, which just
adds to the sense of holding something precious,” she went on.
</p>
<p>
Dwindling biodiversity is only the most obvious way herbaria are
critical to 21st-century science. “Phenology, whether it’s when plants
flower or when birds migrate, is one of the most important signals of
climate change response,” Davis, the Harvard curator, said. Still, our
long-term datasets aren’t very robust; research on how plants are
changing with warming climates typically dates back only 25 to 30 years,
tends to concentrate on the U.S. and Western Europe, and centers on
easily observable phenomena, like the leafing out of woody trees.
Researchers can turn to herbaria for centuries-old records of where
certain plants grew and when they flowered, helping to bridge gaps in
our understanding.
</p>
<p>
Heberling, of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, tracks
environmental changes in his research, but he didn’t start using
herbaria until well after he’d obtained his Ph.D. Only then did he
realize “herbarium specimens are incredible archives of the past,” he
told me.
</p>
<p>
“You can look at the tiny pores, the stomata, on the leaves” of a plant
in a herbarium and “see how that has changed over time with increased
carbon dioxide,” Heberling said. Scientists have even used this method
to create CO2 records.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, climate science is still a relatively cutting-edge use case
for the herbarium; according to Davis’ research, “global change biology”
remains
<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(22)00295-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one
of the least popular</a> ways to leverage herbaria, well behind
“taxonomic monographs” and “species distributions” that still dominate
the field. Still, “there are things that, five to 10 years ago, I’d
never even imagined we’d be doing today with herbarium specimens,” he
told me.
</p>
<p>
As a result, Duke’s herbarium closure has made
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2024/03/18/the-hidden-value-of-herbariums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some
question</a> the university’s commitment to climate research — something
that Alberts, the school’s natural sciences dean, emphatically refuted
when I raised the question with her. She told me that a rough search
revealed that only 23 of the 2,000 papers published by Duke researchers
over the past few decades on climate change contained the word
“herbarium” anywhere in them. “With my knowledge about all of the
climate change research that’s been going on at Duke, the herbarium is
not really central to whether or not Duke studies climate change,” she
said.
</p>
<p>
For her part, Pryer has bristled at the administration’s insinuations
that the herbarium is of limited use to students and faculty on campus.
“You don’t measure a collection by who uses it,” she told me. “As I’ve
been naughty enough to say, it’s not a toilet. People outside — the
global community — uses it. <em>That’s</em> how you measure its value;
things like 90 refereed publications a year [across all disciplines]
cite the Duke collections.” Pryer can quickly tick off the climate
projects that have come through the herbarium’s halls, including her
recent supervision of a local high schooler’s research paper that found
the pink lady’s slipper is flowering in the area 17 days earlier than it
used to.
</p>
<p>
Duke is “not an appropriate home for a herbarium that is this large and
valuable” for a number of reasons, according to Alberts, ranging from
the need to hire new faculty to manage it (Pryer and several of her
colleagues are approaching retirement) to the collection’s current
building needing renovations. “I have had people email me saying, ‘I
know you have enough money, I know you have the facilities.’ I’m like,
‘I’m sorry, you should tell me who you’re talking to, because we
don’t,’” Alberts said. She added that she plans to be personally
involved in finding the right home for Duke’s herbarium over the next
several years.
</p>
<p>
After all, it’s not like the potential untapped climate records in the
Duke collection are being <em>destroyed </em>(though both Pryer and
Davis told me they’ve had deans wonder aloud if they <em>could</em> be,
since many herbaria are now digitized). The goal is only to move the
collection somewhere where it might be better utilized.
</p>
<p>
Thiers, though, said this is exactly what makes the natural science
community so alarmed. As the collection is split up, ideally, the Index
Herbariorum would record where Duke’s specimens get sent so scientists
can still find them. But when new collections absorb the materials,
curators will weed out duplicates, sending unneeded pages elsewhere — at
which point specimens can fall between the cracks. “Before you know it,
individual specimens will be lost,” Thiers said. “I can almost guarantee
that as these secondary moves happen, people will not keep up with the
database records.”
</p>
<p>
There is also a worst-case scenario everyone seemed nervous to mention:
that Duke’s collection, in whole or in part, will end up in storage
somewhere. Herbarium specimens are extremely susceptible to insect
damage and must be kept in expensive, climate-controlled cabinets and
rooms. “If they’re putting boxes in a storage storeroom someplace,
they’ll be worthless in no time,” Thiers warned. The unidentified plants
and uncollected climate data — all of it could be lost. And the cruelest
part? Scientists wouldn’t even know what they are losing; it’s a dark
extinction of a dark extinction.
</p>
<p>
When I spoke with Alberts, she said there were no updates on the
administration’s plans for the herbarium. She expressed sympathy,
though, for the faculty who oppose the administration’s decision. The
herbarium “is their life’s work, and it’s important that they have a
voice in this process,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Pryer is determined to keep fighting, even if this isn’t exactly how
she’d pictured spending her golden years at Duke. “It’s having an impact
on my research and on my health,” she told me. “It’s been pretty
unrelenting. I’m anxious for something to resolve.”
</p>
<p>
She looked tired. There was a faculty meeting later in the day, and she
hoped she’d be able to get more clarity about the administration’s
decision then. “I don’t want this to go on forever,” she said. “But I
also don’t want there to be a decision that makes Duke look insane.”

id="appeals-court-rejects-trumps-latest-attempt-to-delay-april-15-hush-money-criminal-trial">Appeals
court rejects Trump’s latest attempt to delay April 15 hush money
criminal trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A New York appeals court judge Tuesday rejected former
President Donald Trump’s latest bid to delay his hush money criminal
trial while he fights a gag order. Barring further court action, the
ruling clears the way for jury selection to begin next week. </p>
<p>Justice Cynthia Kern’s ruling is yet another loss for Trump, who has
tried repeatedly to get the trial postponed. Jury selection is set to
start Monday. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers wanted the trial delayed until a full panel of
appellate court judges could hear arguments on lifting or modifying a
gag order that bans him from making public statements about jurors,
witnesses and others connected to the hush-money case. </p>
<p>The presumptive Republican nominee’s lawyers argue the gag order is
an unconstitutional curb on Trump’s free speech rights while he’s
campaigning for president and fighting criminal charges. </p>
<p>“The First Amendment harms arising from this gag order right now are
irreparable,” Trump lawyer Emil Bove said at an emergency hearing
Tuesday in the state’s mid-level appeals court. </p>
<p>Bove argued that Trump shouldn’t be muzzled while critics, including
his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels,
routinely assail him. Both are key prosecution witnesses. </p>
<p>Bove also argued that the order unconstitutionally restricts Trump’s
critiques of the case — and, with them, his ability to speak to the
voting public and its right to hear from him. </p>
<p>Steven Wu, the appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney’s
office, countered that there is a “public interest in protecting the
integrity of the trial.” </p>
<p>“What we are talking about here is the defendant’s uncontested
history of making inflammatory, denigrating” comments about people
involved in the case, Wu said. “This is not a political debate. These
are insults.” </p>
<p>He said prosecutors already have had trouble getting some witnesses
to testify “because they know what their names in the press may lead
to.” Wu didn’t identify the witnesses but noted they included people who
would testify about record-keeping practices. </p>
<p>The gag order still affords Trump “free rein to talk about a host of
issues,” noting that he can comment on Judge Juan M. Merchan and
District Attorney Alvin Bragg and “raise political arguments as he sees
fit.” Trump has repeatedly lambasted Bragg, a Democrat, and the
judge. </p>
<p>Merchan issued the gag order last month at prosecutors’ urging, then
expanded it last week to prohibit comments about his own family after
Trump lashed out on social media at the judge’s daughter, a Democratic
political consultant, and made what the court system said were false
claims about her.</p>
<p>Tuesday was the second of back-to-back days for Trump’s lawyers in
the appeals court. Associate Justice Lizbeth González on Monday rejected
their request to delay the trial while Trump seeks to move his case out
of heavily Democratic Manhattan. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers framed their gag order appeal as a lawsuit against
Merchan. In New York, judges can be sued to challenge some decisions
under a state law known as Article 78. </p>
<p>Trump has used the tactic before, including against the judge in his
recent New York civil fraud trial in an unsuccessful last-minute bid to
delay that case last fall and again when that judge imposed a gag order
barring trial participants from commenting publicly on court staffers.
That order came after Trump smeared the judge’s principal law clerk in a
social media post. </p>
<p>A sole appeals judge lifted the civil trial gag order, but an
appellate panel restored it two weeks later. </p>
<p>Trump’s hush-money criminal case involves allegations that he
falsified his company’s records to hide the nature of payments to Cohen,
who helped him bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign. Cohen’s
activities included paying Daniels $130,000 to suppress her claims of an
extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years earlier. </p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying
business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels.
His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal
expenses. </p>
<p>Trump has made numerous attempts to get the trial postponed. </p>
<p>Last week, as Merchan swatted away various requests to delay the
trial, Trump renewed his request for the judge to step aside from the
case. The judge rejected a similar request last August. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers allege the judge is biased against him and has a
conflict of interest because of his daughter Loren’s work as president
of Authentic Campaigns, a firm with clients that have included President
Joe Biden and other Democrats. Trump’s attorneys complained the expanded
gag order was shielding the Merchans “from legitimate public
criticism.” </p>
<p>Merchan had long resisted imposing a gag order. At Trump’s
arraignment in April 2023, he admonished Trump not to make statements
that could incite violence or jeopardize safety, but stopped short of
muzzling him. At a subsequent hearing, Merchan noted Trump’s “special”
status as a former president and current candidate and said he was
“bending over backwards” to ensure Trump has every opportunity “to speak
in furtherance of his candidacy.” </p>
<p>Merchan became increasingly wary of Trump’s rhetoric disrupting the
historic trial as it grew near. In issuing the gag order, he said his
obligation to ensuring the integrity of the proceedings outweighed First
Amendment concerns. </p>
<p>Trump reacted on social media that the gag order was “illegal,
un-American, unConstitutional” and said Merchan was “wrongfully
attempting to deprive me of my First Amendment Right to speak out
against the Weaponization of Law Enforcement” by Democratic rivals. </p>
<p>Trump suggested without evidence that Merchan’s decision-making was
influenced by his daughter’s professional interests and made a claim,
later repudiated by court officials, that Loren Merchan had posted a
social media photo showing Trump behind bars. </p>
<p>After the outburst, Merchan expanded the gag order April 1 to

<h2 id="on-tesla-nazis-x-and-the-macintosh-of-cars">On Tesla, Nazis, X
and the Macintosh of cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I’d buy a Tesla today because of Musk’s politics which he
puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their
nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of
people dying.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who
developed it, who I don’t know. I hope they’re not Nazis. I don’t see
how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">2021</a>,
the year I bought mine, could be anything like that.
</p>
<p>
This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that
comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up
to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original.
</p>
<p>
To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be
hard for me to do. I don’t think my “support” of Tesla could mean that
much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car
(one of its innovations).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It’s
like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even
if I wasn’t one of Apple’s top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs
didn’t design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did.
Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial.
That’s a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept
like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that
Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I
got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don’t want these
products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would
have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic
idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one
who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those
are some of the brightest people out there.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile I’m looking at other company’s EVs with lust. I might like a
Kia or a BMW. If you’re making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not
a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too.
</p>
<p>
PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by
<a href="https://werd.io/">Ben Wurdmuller</a>
<a href="https://werd.io/2024/i-tried-tesla-fsd">posted yesterday</a>.
I’ve had much the same feeling about

<h2 id="what-climate-change-is-doing-to-our-brains">What Climate Change
Is Doing to Our Brains</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk1ODQ4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk1NzQ3OX0.Nyh6Xc8wB8KIgNICEfMMp8MSSIf3gWF_xo-4JV9SA_4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Thinking is physical. Thankfully, one of the many wonderful things about
the human brain is that we don’t have to confront this unsettling fact
very much — that the environment around us shapes our perceptions and
reactions, that all human experience is the result of secreted hormones
and synaptic transmission. In other words, our brains let us think we’re
in charge.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, as with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-change-is-breaking-time" target="_self">so
many other things</a>, climate change is interfering. “As the
environment changes, you should expect to change too,” writes author,
neuroscientist, and <em>Grist</em> senior data scientist Clayton Page
Aldern in his gripping new book,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-weight-of-nature-how-a-changing-climate-changes-our-brains-clayton-page-aldern/20435886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Weight of Nature: How a Changing Climate Changes Our
Brains</em></a><em>. </em>“It is the job of your brain to model the
world as it is,” he goes on. “And the world is mutating.”
</p>
<p>
You may already be familiar with some of his examples — that the heat
can make us
<a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/yale-study-abnormally-hot-days-could-impact-your-cognitive-skills/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dumber</a>
and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/13/heat-hate-speech-aggression-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
aggressive</a>, and that people who survive traumatic weather events can
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2022/02/when-climate-change-becomes-climate-trauma/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get
post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. But Aldern’s book — which, in spite
of its author’s technical background, is immensely readable and literary
— pushes far past the familiar, touching on topics as wide-ranging as
<a href="https://grist.org/climate-energy/climate-change-could-lead-to-a-rise-in-brain-eating-parasites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brain-eating
amoebas</a>,
<a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/04/new-database-offers-insight-consequences-language-loss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">language
death</a>, and free will. The common theme throughout, though, is that
climate is our unseen “puppeteer.”
</p>
<p>
Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You use the phrase “the weight of nature” in several contexts
throughout the book. It made me think of both Altas, as in “the weight
on our shoulders,” and also the idea of determinism that you get into a
bit. At what point in the writing process did you come up with the
title?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It was early on that the title came to me, but it was not the original
title. I’ve been working on this project for six or seven years, and
initially my working title was something awful like <em>Nature’s
Marionette</em>, which sought to communicate this notion of forcing our
hands — the puppetmaster behind our decision-making.
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to be able to communicate this feeling of being guided by
the environment — in addition to carrying said burden — because it felt
like weight. It does feel heavy, and heaviness does a lot of things,
including forcing our hands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there something about brains that makes them uniquely
vulnerable to climate change? I ask because I’m sure books could be
written about how climate change hurts our hearts or lungs, too. But it
seems to impact our brains in a variety of terrifying forms.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hearts do one thing: They beat. Brains are always reaching outward, and
so, by extension, they’re enmeshed in the same manner in which one can
imagine our entire bodies to be enmeshed in this “environment.”
</p>
<p>
More specifically, in addition to the reaching-out action, brains are
actively modeling the world around us. That is what they do. This notion
of having an active organ, as opposed to a somewhat passive organ, makes
the difference because brains are always integrating new information
about the world. And the world is changing.
</p>
<p>
As we come to terms with this changing world — and when I use the phrase
“come to terms,” I’m not seeking to deploy some kind of intellectual or
emotional metaphor here. I mean, on a <em>biophysical level</em>, as
we’re coming to terms with these changes — then neurochemical changes
result accordingly. We respond in kind. Certainly, our other organs are
adaptive to various degrees, but the whole point of the brain is its
adaptive nature, right? It seeks to model the world around us, and it
implements change through a system known as neuroplasticity. It is an
organ that is built for modeling and integrating change. And so, is it
any wonder that climate change acts directly on this organ in ways it
may not act on others?

<p>
<strong>The chapter about Karl Friston and the give-and-take of
perception — in which you write, “our actions are the world’s
sensations, and our sensations are the world’s actions” — completely
blew my mind.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I haven’t even told this to my editor, but I think if I’m ever granted
the privilege of writing a book again, I might try to pitch a biography
of Karl Friston. His research is unbelievably interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is his work well-known among neuroscientists, or is it kind of
fringe even within the community?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That’s a fabulous question, and I’ll tell you why: Karl is one of the
most cited neuroscientists of all time, but most neuroscientists have
not heard of him. The reason that paradox is true is because, early in
his career, he developed some of the basic algorithmic technology
underlying functional resonance in functional magnetic resonance
imaging: fMRI. And so, anytime anybody uses fMRI, which most
neuroscientists do, there’s this casual Fristonian citation that goes
back to his early work.
</p>
<p>
Far fewer people have paid attention to his groundbreaking work on
what’s called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle#:~:text=By%20actively%20changing%20the%20world,well%20as%20to%20artificial%20intelligence." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free
energy hypothesis</a>. If you Google, like, “the most influential
neuroscientists of all time,” he’s always on these lists, but nobody
knows who he is. Well, <em>nobody</em> is a stretch; he’s reasonably
well-known in sub-communities. But by and large, he’s such an abstract
thinker, and his material is so difficult to internalize, that most
people who are attracted to his work fall into the neuro-theory
community, computational neuroscientists, theoretical neuroscientists —
and that’s, frankly, the vast minority of neuroscientists. So he is
somewhat of an unknown entity, which is just astounding because he has
literally been in the running for the Nobel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Something that struck me was how many gaps there are in the
science of understanding our own brains — we often seem to know the
general <em>region</em> where thoughts or impulses originate but not
quite the mechanics of how they work. Are there certain mysteries about
our consciousness and perception that might always remain slightly out
of our reach?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s a <em>huge</em> body of research that seeks to address whether
or not the question of consciousness, and understanding it, is
unravelable at all. This is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
hard problem of consciousness</a>. Have we made progress in our
understanding of consciousness over the past 100 or 200 years? Well,
almost certainly, yes. And in neuroscience, we’ve come closer to an
understanding of what perception is and what consciousness is.
</p>
<p>
Will another 20 years or so get us closer to an ultimate, grounded, and
internalized rational scientific representation there of? Maybe! But
there are also people today who argue with just as much empirical
backing that the notion of solving consciousness — the notion of,
basically, a self coming to understand itself — is a logically
impossible act.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a consciousness researcher, so I’m not sure if I have enough
background to really say that I’ve made my mind up. But there are
certainly folks out there who say consciousness is not something that’s
solvable, it’s not something that we will ever understand in the same
materialistic terms that, perhaps, we understand the heart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I’m going to be obnoxious and ask the AI question. You didn’t
really get into the possibility and pitfalls of technology, but I’m
wondering if it was back of mind at all while you were writing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m going to give you an obnoxious answer. In fact, it’s a decades-old
obnoxious answer. When I’m thinking about this stuff, my instinct is to
think about technology in terms of the manners in which it removes us
from nature. So much of the promise in this area of research — and I do
think there’s promise, I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom — is that
this intimate relationship we have with the planet is also that which
can be leveraged to help mediate some of these detrimental effects.
</p>
<p>
There’s a fabulous book from a couple of years ago,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780393355574" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Nature Fix,</em> by Florence Williams</a>; I have come to understand my
book as its dark version. <em>The Nature Fix</em> details all the
manners in which interacting with nature, as opposed to the built
environment, is essential for mental, psychological, spiritual, and
neurological health.
</p>
<p>
This is an obnoxious answer because it’s the classic “<em>Oh, kids are
all looking at their phones!</em>” But I think that’s real — the
handheld devices and the omniscience of the all-knowing screen, which,
perhaps we can extend that to the LLMs. As it were, there’s this suite
of technologies that mediates our relationship both with knowledge writ
large and the broader environment outside of ourselves. In my estimate,
it filters the world in a way that I suspect is preventing us from
interacting with some of the benefits that the environment has to offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The same things that make our brains incredible — their ability
to adapt, create, and use language — are also what allowed us to invent
the combustion engine, organize global commodities markets, and design
machines for fracking. In a sense, the climate fight requires beating
back against the weight and consequences of our own brains,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I think about this question, it’s less about “how can we ensure
we’re using the tools of evolution, the powers of the brain, for good,”
and more about coming to terms with the fact that something like free
will doesn’t exist.
</p>
<p>
There’s this thinker, Timothy Morton, who writes a lot about our
enmeshment with the environment and the degree to which one cannot
separate the self from the greater universe. Taken to its extreme, that
thinking — which I think is very powerful — implies that what we need to
wrap our heads around and come to terms with is the fact that we’re not
really making decisions, per se. It’s just a universe of particles in
motion. So grappling with what Morton calls
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780674064225" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
ecological thought</a>, grappling with this notion of determinism and
enmeshment, and trying to suss out the moral responsibilities that fall
out of that relationship — that, to me, is a worthy task and, frankly,
an unsolved problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>As a neuroscientist working in the climate space, what keeps you
up at night?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The 20-year timeline keeps me up at night. A lot of the research that
we’re coming to terms with today is going to make itself known on a much
more visceral level over the next 20 to 50 years. If it is in fact the
case that cyanobacterial blooms are releasing a neurotoxin that is
spurring an increased risk of ALS, that neurodegenerative disease isn’t
necessarily going to manifest in people whom it is likely to affect for
a number of years. We’re not going to see in tangible, visceral terms a
corresponding spike in this disease in the general population for
another couple of decades.
</p>
<p>
I just published
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/everybody-has-a-breaking-point-how-the-climate-crisis-affects-our-brains" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
piece in<em> The Guardian</em></a> about some of these effects, and one
of the researchers I interviewed for that piece basically said what I’m
trying to communicate now, which is: We’re in the midst of a grand
experiment. It’s not like a lab where you’ve got a rat, and you’re
selectively exposing it to one toxin over the course of some fixed time
period and measuring the results. The lab that we’re in is the Earth and
we are exposed to climatic and environmental stressors in this soup,
chronically, for years and years, and in unknown quantities. At some
point, we’re going to look around and say, “Oh, this is really bad. We
should do something about this.” And for many people, it will be too
late.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What gives you hope?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t like hope. I think that hope breeds complacency — or, at least,
false hope does. I tend personally not to look for vectors of hope per
se, which is not to say that I’m a pessimist or a nihilist or anything
like that. I look for climate solutions, for example, or sources of
resilience, or stories of the capacity of the human spirit that inspire
me with a feeling of desire. I’m interested in having images out there
in the world that point my compass toward a future that I would like to
realize.

id="us-top-military-leaders-face-congress-over-pentagon-budget-and-questions-on-israel-ukraine-support">US
top military leaders face Congress over Pentagon budget and questions on
Israel, Ukraine support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman
Gen. Charles Brown Jr. testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday about the
Pentagon’s $850 billion budget for 2025 as questions remained as to
whether lawmakers will support current spending needs for Israel or
Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Senate hearing was the first time lawmakers on both sides were
able to question the Pentagon’s top civilian and military leadership on
the administration’s Israel strategy following the country’s deadly
strike on World Central Kitchen humanitarian aid workers in Gaza. It
also follows continued desperate pleas by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr
Zelenskyy that if the U.S. does not help soon, Kyiv will lose the war to
Russia.</p>
<p>In their opening statements, both Austin and Brown emphasized that
their 2025 budget is still shaped with the military’s long-term
strategic goal in mind — to ready forces and weapons for a potential
future conflict with China. About $100 billion of this year’s request is
set aside for new space, nuclear weapons and cyber warfare systems the
military says it must invest in now before Beijing’s capabilities
surpass it.</p>
<p>But the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel are challenging a
deeply-divided Congress and have resulted in months of delays in getting
last year’s defense budget through, which was only passed by lawmakers a
few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Austin’s opening remarks were temporarily interrupted by protesters
lifting a Palestinian flag and shouting at him to stop sending weapons
to Israel. “Stop the genocide,” they said, as they lifted their hands,
stained in red, in the air.</p>
<p>The Pentagon scraped together about $300 million in ammunition to
send to Kyiv in March but cannot send more without Congress’ support,
and a separate $60 billion supplemental bill that would fund those
efforts has been stalled for months.</p>
<p>“The price of U.S. leadership is real. But it is far lower than the
price of U.S. abdication,” Austin told the senators.</p>
<p>If Kyiv falls, it could imperil Ukraine’s Baltic NATO member
neighbors and potentially drag U.S. troops into a prolonged European
war. If millions die in Gaza due to starvation, it could enrage Israel’s
Arab neighbors and lead to a much wider, deadlier Middle East conflict —
one that could also bring harm to U.S. troops and to U.S. relations in
the region for decades.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has urged Congress to support new assistance for Ukraine
for months, to no avail, and has tried to walk a perilous line between
defending its ally Israel and maintaining ties with key regional Arab
partners. Israel’s actions in Gaza have been used as a rallying cry by
factions of Iranian-backed militant groups, including the Houthis in
Yemen and Islamic Resistance groups across Iraq and Syria, to strike at
U.S. interests. Three U.S. service members have already been killed as
drone and missile attacks increased against U.S. bases in the
region.</p>
<p>Six U.S. military ships with personnel and components to build a
humanitarian aid pier are also still en route to Gaza but questions
remain as to how food that arrives at the pier will be safely
distributed inside the devastated territory.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are also seeing demands at home. For months, a handful of
its far-right members have kept Congress from approving additional money
or weapons for Ukraine until domestic needs like curbing the crush of
migrants at the southern U.S. border are addressed. Republican House
Speaker Mike Johnson is already facing a call to oust him as speaker by
Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene because Johnson is trying
to work out a compromise that would move the Ukraine aid forward.</p>
<p>On Israel, the World Central Kitchen strike led to a shift in tone
from President Joe Biden on how Israel must protect civilian life in
Gaza and drove dozens of House Democrats, including former House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, to call on Biden to halt weapons transfers to Israel.</p>
<p>Half the population of Gaza is starving and on the brink of famine
due to Israel’s tight restrictions on allowing aid trucks through.</p>

Below the fold is the story of how I got a full-time Internet connection
at my apartment 32 years ago next month, and the incredible success of
my first ISP.<br /> <br /> The reason I’m now able to tell this story is
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jennings">Tom
Jennings</a>, the moving spirit behind the ISP has
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">two</a>
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">posts</a>
describing the history of The Little Garden, which was the name the ISP
had adopted (from a Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto) when I joined it in
May 1993. Tom’s perspective from the ISP’s point of view contrasts with
my perspective — that of a fairly early customer enhanced by information
via e-mail from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)">John
Gilmore</a> and Tim Pozar, who were both involved far earlier than
I.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Jennings
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">starts
his story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Once upon a time, three little businesses wanted a connection to the
ARPAnet/internet. The year was 1990 or 1991. John Gilmore, John
Romke[y], and Trusted Information Systems (TIS) split the $15K or so it
took to get a leased-line and 3COM Brouters to Alternet, with what today
you’d call fractional T1. An additional 56K leased line and Brouter
brought the ’net up to Gilmore’s house, Toad Hall, in San Francisco.
</blockquote>
The three little businesses were Cygnus Support (John Gilmore), Epilogue
Technology (John Romkey) and Trusted Information Systems (Steve
Crocker). AlterNet was run by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adams_(Internet_pioneer)">Rick
Adams</a>, whom Wikipedia justly describes as an “Internet pioneer”. He
founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUNET">UUNET
Technologies</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the mid-1990s, UUNET was the fastest-growing ISP, outpacing MCI and
Sprint. At its peak, Internet traffic was briefly doubling every few
months, which translates to 10x growth each year.
</blockquote>
John Gilmore, a truly wonderful person, had many friends. So
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">what
happened was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As time went on, friends of theirs wanted in on this rare and exciting
’net connection, resulting in Tim Pozar putting an old PC running Phil
Karn’s KA9Q/NOS program, an amateur radio router capable of TCP/IP, onto
Toad Hall’s ethernet. Tim installed a pair of modems, then dialed in
once and stayed connected 24 hrs/day (Pacific Bell never said you
couldn’t do that…)
</blockquote>
Once Tim showed that it was possible, this
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">idea
took off</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Eventually the NOS box was full, and more friends wanted in, but
everyone was too busy to deal with the hassle.<br /> <br /> Somehow, in
September 1992, Pozar and Gilmore and I worked out a deal where, I would
maintain the thing, collect money to build more NOS boxes and contribute
to the monthly Alternet bill, install more people, and get (1) a free
connection to the internet and (2) a slice off the top after it exceeded
N connections.<br /> <br /> By that December, there were enough
connections in place that I was pocketing $420/month. By March 1993
there were 11 modem-connected members (as we fancied ourselves).
</blockquote>
In 1989 Gilmore had co-founded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions">Cygnus
Support</a>, whose tagline was “Making free software affordable”. TLG
got started in August 1990 with the three businesses’ nodes on a 56K
leased line. One was at Cygnus first office in an apartment complex on
University Avenue in Palo Alto. Gilmore and other Cygnus employees had
apartments there, so they used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2">10BASE2</a> coaxial
cable Ethernet to distribute the Internet around the complex. Gilmore
notes that they used “nonstandard thin 50-ohm coax in the expansion
joints across the driveways when needed”. Pozar notes that they paved
over the coax!<br /> <br /> Gilmore was paying more than $300/mo for
modem phone lines supporting the Alt Usenet groups, and realized that
for less than that he could have a 56K line from Cygnus to his basement
in SF. That led to Pozar and Rich Morin’s Canta Forda Computer
installing the old PC and becoming the first to use the permanent local
call idea.<br /> <br /> I knew Gilmore from the early days of Sun
Microsystems (he was employee #5), so I first found out about the Point
of Presence (PoP) in his basement in late 1992 and <i>really</i> wanted
to join in. Alas, there was a snag — the reason the idea worked was that
local phone calls were free. From my home in Palo Alto to Toad Hall was
a toll call, making it impossibly expensive. But in May 1993 I found out
about the PoP on University, 8 blocks from my apartment.<br /> <br /> I
purchased:<br />
<ul>
<li>
A phone line from Pacific Bell at the PoP.
</li>
<li>
A second phone line at my apartment.
</li>
<li>
A pair of Zyxel 9.6Kb modems, one for the PoP and one for my apartment.
</li>

If memory serves, it cost $250 installation fee and $70/month, and Tom
Jennings helped me plug in one of the modems at the University PoP. I
already had two SparcStations, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation#Integrated_monitor/portable_systems">SparcStation
SLC</a> with an external SCSI hard disk I bought on Sun’s employee
purchase program, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1">SparcStation
1+</a>, the prizes Steve Kleiman and I won in an internal “Vision Quest”
at Sun. My apartment was open-plan and the 1+’s fans were too noisy to
let me sleep, but the SLC was fanless and could be on-line continuously.
The SLC, the hard disk and the modem sat on a conveniently large window
ledge. There was a wired Ethernet connection from the window ledge to
the desk. When I say “wired” I mean that it ran on the apartments
internal phone wires, but the distance was short enough that it
worked.<br /> <br />

This setup was remarkably reliable. If the call dropped, the SunOS
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1055">SLIP</a>
software automatically re-dialled it. I have no memory of problems with
it; I think the only times it was down were when I upgraded the modems
as faster ones became available, or when I put the whole system on an
Uninterruptible Power Supply. It may have been then that I noticed it
had been up over 500 days. I didn’t really need the UPS, Palo Alto’s
municipal utilities are also very reliable.<br /> <br /> As I recall it
ran happily until I passed the apartment on to my step-daughter’s family
in summer 2000. Seven years of impeccable service. By that time I was
working on the LOCKSS program at Stanford, and we had DSL service from
Stanford IT. So I went from an ISP with great tech support to an ISP
with great support. Then as I relate in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html"><i>ISP
Monopolies</i></a> in September 2001
<a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/morgue/2001/2001_09_28.ftth28.html">Palo
Alto’s Fiber-to-the-Home trial</a> went live and I had 10Mbit
bi-directional fiber with great support from Palo Alto Utilities. Since
the trial ended our ISP has been
<a href="https://www.sonic.com/">Sonic</a>, first over 3/1Mbit DSL and
now over
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html">gigabit
fiber</a>. So we are really used to having great support from our
ISP.<br /> <br /> TLG was an astonishing success. From something like
$2000/month in December 1992 it grew
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">an
average of 12% per month from Jan94 through July96</a>” when it had
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">a
monthly gross of about $125,000.00</a> until:<br />
<blockquote>
Luckily we were bought by Best Internet Communications, Mountain View;
they had money, marketing, and a non-burned-out management; we had a
solid locked-in customer base and positive cash flow.
</blockquote>
Best turned out to be a pretty good ISP too.<br /> <br /> Jennings’
explanations for TLG’s success are interesting. First,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">technical
competence</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Edgar Nielsen almost single-handedly built the technical infrastructure
that TLGnet ran on. He designed much of the network and routing
structure, all of the security (with some help from Stu Grossman), wrote
a complete, queryable, shared and remotely-accessible database (included
every single modem, router, wire, cable, customer, IP (domain names and
IP address allocations), and logical link) in standard and portable
tools, installed equipment, built and maintained our unix boxes, put
SNMP on every single node (hundreds) and automated the entire ISP
technical infrastructure from one end to the other. I doubt many small
to mid-size ISPs today have the things Edgar wrote by 1995.
</blockquote>
Second,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">good
HR</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Another thing of crucial importance to me, and to Deke, Edgar and a
lesser extent Gilmore, was hiring from our local communities; we hired
principled people, punk and queer writers and organizers, and trained
and paid them – pay in scale with effort. Total staff turn-over in three
years was probably 20; peak staff was 12. Some 10 of them started out at
$8.00/hr, unskilled, ended up with $30,000 salary a year later
[1994-1996], and stayed in the industry (at prevailing pay). (And we
provided health insurance too. Deke being damned Wobbly may have had
some small effect.)<br /> …<br /> we treated our staff well, gave them
credit for work done, paid them actual money, gave raises and bonuses
(upon sale of the business, even some fired employees got small bonus
checks). TLGnet wouldn’t have existed without its talented staff!
</blockquote>
Third, an innovative business model starting with their
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">terms
and conditions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
TLGnet exercises no control whatsoever over the content of the
information passing through TLGnet. You are free to communicate
commercial, noncommercial, personal, questionable, obnoxious, annoying,
or any other kind of information, misinformation, or disinformation
through our service. You are fully responsible for the privacy of,
content of, and liability for your own communications.
</blockquote>
Jennings explains the
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">business
model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Concentrate on bulk, fulltime internet access (leased-line and Frame
Relay)
</li>
<li>
Keep prices low by providing connectivity only
</li>
<li>
Unrestricted use of TLG connectivity
</li>
<li>
Encourage resale and vertical-market services
</li>
<li>
Full, up-front disclosure of all pricing
</li>
<li>
No lock-in contracts
</li>
<li>
Unbundle installation costs and eliminate padding
</li>
<li>
Full technical disclosure of technical information
</li>
</ul>
Essentially, other ISPs restricted use and resale of their connections,
in a sort of zero-sum approach. By concentrating on bulk connectivity we
at once created a market for our customers to provide the vertical
services we didn’t want or couldn’t afford to provide, and built a
hard-to-beat solid rep that for a long while locked out direct
competitors to our core business; having our prices online and breaking
down the leased-line costs and equipment gave us a major one-up
economically, technically, and in credible reputation over nearly all
other ISPs, big or small.
</blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">result
was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Some thought us insane; but in fact our customers didn’t “compete” with
us, they provided vertical services we couldn’t or wouldn’t (I guess we
did have a business plan). And in fact we set further standards of
behavior and policies that other ISPs, including MCI and SprintLink,
were obliged to match. Though some, like Alternet and PSI, never did;
they skimmed the high-end deep-pockets customers, and we got all the new
growth.
</blockquote>
Gilmore writes:<br />
<blockquote>
I would add to the “Busines Model” discussion, that communication costs
per-bit dropped dramatically with volume. When you upgraded from 56k
bit/sec leased lines to T1 (1,500k bit/sec), you got 24x the bandwidth
but it only cost about 4x as much. An upgrade to T3 (45 megabit)
provided 30x the bandwidth of a T1, and didn’t cost anything near to 30x
as much. So, as your traffic volume grew because you were adding more
and more customers, the cost of your basic connection to the rest of the
Internet got significantly cheaper (per bit). That economy of scale
meant that ISPs who grew could keep affording to upgrade their backbones
to handle the traffic growth. Every ISP knew, or figured out, this
economics, and they all depended on it. Remember, this was back when
there were 2000 ISP’s in the US, mostly local ones. (About 30 of them
were getting their Internet service from TLG when we sold it to Best.)
</blockquote>
There is a fascinating October 29 1996 interview entitled
<a href="https://archive.org/details/BrewsterKahleOnWAISAndTheStartOfTheInternetArchive1996"><i>Tim
Pozar and Brewster Kahle CHM Interview</i></a> by Marc Weber. The first
part of the interview is all about TLG. In it Brewster Kahle sums up the
story (I cleaned up his stream of conciousness a bit):<br />
<blockquote>
it took six months of a full-time person to get us on the DARPA net in
1985 … but The Little Garden basically made it so that any old person
[could connect] and more than that not just themselves but … enabling
other people to create their own ISPs and I don’t know there are 400
ISPs now in the Bay Area in large part because of The Little Garden.

Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the
Secrets of the Aurora</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern
lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not
fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from
instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample
multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these
limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop
instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more
than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about
the amazing physics happening within the aurora.</p>

<h2 id="ten-years-ago-windows-xp-received-its-final-update">Ten years
ago, Windows XP received its final update</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final
security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for
one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at
Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was
using at the time – BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x – Windows XP felt kind of
like a bad joke I wasn’t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn’t seem to
offer anything substantial, and it didn’t take long for major security
incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn’t
until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into
its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better
alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I’m of course talking
about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today
though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP
has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows
XP – the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense – the
sound set, the wallpaper of course – has become iconic, warts and all,
and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as
they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few
service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I
would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and
Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that’s more of a personal thing
and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly
been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will
suddenly get good, either.</p>

launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant
leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app
servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory
caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training
and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of
purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like
networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and
improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads
storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that
decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically
provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM
processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In
other words, we’ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to
eBay in a few years.</p>

<li>European court says government inaction on climate change threatens
human rights
</h3>
<p>
The European Court of Human Rights handed down a landmark decision this
morning that could ramp up legal pressure on governments to do more to
limit global warming. The lawsuit was brought by a group of more than
2,000 older Swiss women who argued Switzerland had violated their human
rights by failing to do its part to stop climate change. Older women are
more likely to die from extreme heat, and the group said they suffer
severely during Swiss heatwaves. The court agreed with them, saying
Switzerland hadn’t done enough to meet its emissions reduction targets.
The verdict “opens up all 46 members of the Council of Europe to similar
cases in national courts that they are likely to lose,”

will urge all oil and gas customers to set interim emissions targets and
put together 2050 net zero plans that are credible, “not just a

The study estimates the ice surface contains between 300,000 and 850,000
meteorites waiting to be collected, but says 24% of them will be lost by
2050 under current warming conditions, and for every tenth of a degree
of increase in global air temperature, an average of nearly 9,000
meteorites will disappear. “The loss of Antarctic meteorites is much
like the loss of data that scientists glean from ice cores collected
from vanishing glaciers,” said Harry Zekollari, a co-author on the
study. “Once they disappear, so do some of the secrets of the universe.”

engine in Qt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project
originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project’s
still got a long way to go, it’s definitely a serious contender to
become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it’s
starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on
bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine
inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++.
This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for
webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They’re
already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using
Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely
eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill
now.</p>

including: FDA-approved medication abortion; defended access to
emergency medical care; supported the ability to travel for reproductive
health care; strengthened access to high-quality, affordable
contraception; safeguarded the privacy of patients and health care
providers and ensured access to accurate information and legal
resources, according to a March 7, 2024 White House fact sheet.</p>
<p>On March 26, 2024, Biden said, “If America sends me a Congress that
are Democrats, I promise you, Kamala and I will restore Roe vs. Wade is
the law of the land again.” He also warned on March 8, 2024, that
“states are passing bans criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest
victims to leave their state to get care. And now MAGA Republicans and
Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period.
Well. Take it seriously, folks, because that’s what they’re heading for.
Hear me loud and clear. This will not happen on my watch.”</p>
<p>Trump: Trump’s three Supreme Court nominees during his presidency
shifted the balance of the court, resulting in an overturning of Roe
vs. Wade, sending the decision to legalize abortion back to the
states.</p>
<p>Trump announced on April 8, 2024, that he believed abortion
legislation should be left up to each state. Previously, he suggested a
nationwide ban on abortion after 15 weeks, saying, “Fifteen weeks seems
to be a number that people are agreeing at.”</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>Biden: In a December 5, 2023, speech in Boston, Biden said the
economy had created 14 million new jobs — more jobs than any president
has created in a four-year term; record economic growth — over 5% just
the last quarter; unemployment under 4% for 20 months in a row, and the
lowest inflation rate of any of the world’s major economies. Biden
signed the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act, which authorized $550 billion in new spending.</p>
<p>Trump: According to his campaign website, during his presidency,
“President Donald J. Trump passed record-setting tax relief for the
middle class, doubled the child tax credit, and slashed more job-killing
regulations than any administration had ever done before. Real wages
quickly increased as a result, and median household income reached the
highest level in the history of our country, while poverty reached a
record low.”</p>
<p>Immigration/border security</p>
<p>Biden: President Biden supported the bipartisan Senate Border
Security Act that would have provided billions of dollars in additional
funding for security and enabled him to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border
if daily and weekly border encounters surpassed certain metrics. Former
President Trump pressured Republican lawmakers to reject the border
security deal, resulting in its failure to pass in the U.S. Congress. On
March 9, 2024, Biden said, “On my first day in office as president, I
introduced a comprehensive, comprehensive plan to fix our immigration
system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for
dreamers and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped
us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our
community.”</p>
<p>Trump: On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump has pledged to conduct
the largest deportation in U.S. history, shift “massive portions of
federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement” and terminate the
visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.</p>
<p>On his campaign website, Trump said that in cooperative states, he
will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist
with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals. He also
pledged to deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects
American labor and promotes American values.</p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump issued an executive order suspending
entry into the United States for everyone from Iraq, Libya, Syria and
Yemen for 90 days and indefinitely for Syrian refugees. He began
construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Criminal justice</p>
<p>Biden: In multiple executive orders, the president has directed the
Justice Department not to renew contracts with privately operated
criminal detention facilities; directed billions of dollars in public
funds to community safety initiatives; and expanded community grants to
keep guns off the streets.</p>
<p>During his State of the Union speech on March 7, 2024, Biden said,
“I’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Pass universal background checks. None of this. None of this. I taught
the Second Amendment for 12 years. None of this violates the Second
Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.”</p>
<p>Trump: During his presidency, Trump launched Operation Legend to
combat a surge of violent crime in cities, resulting in more than 5,500
arrests and signed the Safe Policing for Safe Communities executive
order to incentivize local police department reforms in line with law
and order.</p>
<p>The former president made hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of
surplus military equipment available to local law enforcement, signed an
executive order to help prevent violence against law enforcement
officers and signed the bipartisan First Step Act into law, the first
landmark criminal justice reform legislation ever passed to reduce
recidivism and help former inmates successfully rejoin society.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail this year, Trump has made the case he will
combat crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I do great with the suburban housewives because they want to remain
safe. But they [undocumented immigrants] loot the jewelry, they take
their purses, electronics, watches, all of their cash. And the people
come back and they say, what happened? If you don’t want illegal alien
criminals crawling through your windows and ransacking your drawers,
then you must vote for the fact that we have to throw Crooked Joe Biden
out as fast as possible,” he said on April 2, 2024.</p>
<p>Climate/energy production</p>
<p>Biden: The Democratic president rejoined the Paris climate agreement
and signed the Inflation Reduction Act, investing hundreds of billions
of dollars in clean energy, electric vehicles and environmental justice.
His administration also met goals of cutting emissions by at least 50%
by 2030 and was among the leaders who launched the Global Methane
Pledge, tackling super polluters.</p>
<p>Trump: During his presidency, Trump pulled out of the Paris climate
agreement and claimed that Earth’s temperatures “will start getting
cooler.” Trump appointees dismantled fossil fuel agreements, kept
coal-burning power plants open and launched an anti-trust probe of
automakers who agreed to clean air standards.</p>
<p>“President Trump will unleash the production of domestic energy
resources, reduce the soaring price of gasoline, diesel and natural gas,
promote energy security for our friends around the world, eliminate the
socialist Green New Deal and ensure the United States is never again at
the mercy of a foreign supplier of energy,” according to his campaign
website.</p>

envoy to UN to visit Korean border, North Korean defectors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will
travel to the heavily armed Korean border and meet North Korean
defectors in South Korea, her office said on Monday, amid faltering U.N.
efforts to ensure sanctions enforcement against the North.</p>
<p>Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s trip, set for April 14-20, came
after Russia rejected the annual renewal of the multinational panel of
experts, which has over the past 15 years worked on the implementation
of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile
programs.</p>
<p>Washington, Seoul and Tokyo criticized Moscow’s veto and China’s
abstention, which experts said would undermine the sanctions
enforcement, with a South Korean envoy likening it to “destroying a CCTV
to avoid being caught red-handed.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield’s trip, which will also include a stop in Japan,
was meant to advance bilateral and trilateral cooperation on the
sanctions and beyond, U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson Nate Evans
said.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and Japan are currently members of the Security
Council.</p>
<p>“In both countries, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will discuss next
steps to ensure a continuation of independent and accurate reporting of
the DPRK’s ongoing weapons proliferation and sanctions evasion
activities,” Evans said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its
official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>In South Korea, Thomas-Greenfield will travel to the heavily
fortified Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, meet young North
Korean defectors as well as students at Ewha Womans University, Evans
said.</p>
<p>In Japan, she will also meet family members of Japanese citizens who
were abducted in the early 2000s by North Korea, and visit Nagasaki,
which was hit by U.S. nuclear bombing in 1945.</p>

id="report-us-must-enhance-critical-minerals-strategy-in-africa">Report:
US must enhance critical minerals strategy in Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States must refine its Africa policy
with a focus on critical minerals, including boosting its diplomatic and
commercial presence in African mining hubs, says a report from the
Washington-based United States Institute of Peace, or USIP.</p>
<p>The group says the changes are needed to safeguard against export
controls and market manipulation by geopolitical competitors.</p>
<p>The United States heavily relies on imports for many critical
minerals for use in electric vehicle batteries and other applications
such as cobalt, graphite and manganese.</p>
<p>“Especially concerning is that the United States is at or near 100%
reliant on ‘foreign entities of concern’ — mainly the People’s Republic
of China — for key critical minerals,” says the USIP report.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the Biden administration and Congress to
support U.S. firms in African markets, progress remains measured, with
no sign that China and Gulf State competitors are retreating. The USIP
report recommends the U.S. government invests in “commercial diplomacy”
in Africa.</p>
<p>For example, Washington should prioritize to fully realize the
potential benefits of a memorandum of understanding signed with the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia, following the U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit in December 2022 to jointly develop a supply chain for
electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>The DRC produces more than 70% of the world’s cobalt, while Zambia is
the world’s sixth-largest copper producer and the second-largest cobalt
producer in Africa.</p>
<p>The USIP report also recommends that the U.S. increase the physical
presence of diplomatic and commercial officers in mining centers. Given
the proximity of the Congolese city of Lubumbashi to critical minerals,
and the high priority placed on the country’s Lobito Corridor, USIP
suggests reopening a U.S. consulate in Lubumbashi, provided security
levels are acceptable.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the United States closed its consulate in
Lubumbashi following the end of the Cold War and the redirection of
interests and resources. Lubumbashi is the capital of the mineral-rich
Katanga Province and the second-largest city in the DRC.</p>
<p>Gécamines, the Congolese state mining company, is headquartered in
the city, as are other mining companies.</p>
<p>Other policy recommendations include prioritizing and leveraging
existing U.S. Agency for International Development programs to assist
Africans with rule-of-law and fiscal transparency efforts, expanding
membership of the Minerals Security Partnership to include African
partners, as well as assisting African nations in building technical
capacity in the mining sector.</p>
<p>Launched in June 2022, the Minerals Security Partnership, or MSP, is
a collaboration of 14 countries and the European Union to catalyze
public and private investment in responsible critical minerals supply
chains globally.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say MSP members represent more than 50% of global
gross domestic product and currently run 23 projects that involve the
extraction and processing of cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium,
graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel and rare earth elements. </p>
<p>“We need to scale up our critical mineral supply chains to deploy
clean technologies more quickly, more effectively,” U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken told an MSP forum in Leuven, Belgium, earlier this
month. “The demand is rising. By 2040, demand for lithium is expected to
grow by more than 40%. Graphite, cobalt, nickel demand is set to grow 20
to 25 times.”</p>

id="from-overcapacity-to-tiktok-issues-covered-during-janet-yellens-trip-to-china">From
overcapacity to TikTok, issues covered during Janet Yellen’s trip to
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her team are
leaving China and returning to Washington after trying to tackle the
major questions of the day between the countries. Here’s a look at what
she tried to accomplish, what was achieved, and where things stand for
the world’s two largest economies:</p>
<p>Unfair trade practices</p>
<p>Yellen said she wanted to go into the U.S.-China talks to address a
major Biden administration complaint that Beijing’s economic model and
trade practices put American companies and workers at an unfair
competitive disadvantage by producing highly subsidized solar products,
electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries at a loss, dominating the
global market.</p>
<p>Chinese government subsidies and other policy support have encouraged
solar panel and EV makers in China to invest in factories, building far
more production capacity than the domestic market can absorb. She calls
this overcapacity.</p>
<p>Throughout the week of meetings, she talked about the risks that come
from one nation maintaining nearly all production capacity in these
industries, the threat it poses to other nations’ industries and how a
massive rapid increase in exports from one country can have big impacts
on the global economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the two sides agreed to hold “intensive exchanges” on
more balanced economic growth, according to a U.S. statement issued
after Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng held extended meetings
over two days in the southern city of Guangzhou. It was not immediately
clear when and where the talks would take place.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month, but I think
they have heard that this is an important issue to us,” she said.</p>
<p>Money laundering, related crimes</p>
<p>After several rounds of meetings, the U.S. Treasury and the Chinese
central bank agreed to work together to stop money laundering in their
respective financial systems.</p>
<p>Nearly all the precursor chemicals that are needed to make the deadly
substance fentanyl are coming from China into the U.S. The U.S. says
exchanging information on money laundering related to fentanyl
trafficking may help disrupt the flow of the precursor chemicals into
Mexico and the U.S.</p>
<p>“Treasury is committed to using all of our tools, including
international cooperation, to counter this threat,” Yellen said in a
speech announcing the formation of the group.</p>
<p>The new cooperative between the U.S. and China will be part of the
two nations’ economic working groups that were launched last September,
and the first exchange will be held in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>TikTok</p>
<p>Efforts in the U.S. to ban social media app TikTok, owned by Chinese
parent company ByteDance, were raised initially by the Chinese during
U.S-China talks, a senior Treasury official told The Associated Press.
The firm has in the past promoted a data security restructuring plan
called “Project Texas” that it says sufficiently guards against national
security concerns.</p>
<p>However, U.S. lawmakers have moved forward with efforts to either ban
the app or force the Chinese firm to divest its interest in the company,
which the White House has supported. In China this week, it was evident
that there was little movement on the issue.</p>
<p>Yellen said at a news conference Monday that she supported the
administration’s efforts to address national security issues that relate
to sensitive personal data. “This is a legitimate concern,” she
said.</p>
<p>“Many U.S. social apps are not allowed to operate in China,” Yellen
said. “We would like to find a way forward.”</p>
<p>Financial stability</p>
<p>On the second day of Yellen’s trip to China, the U.S. and China
announced an agreement to work closely on issues related to financial
stability, in that U.S. and Chinese financial regulators agreed to hold
a series of exercises simulating a failure of a large bank in either of
the two countries.</p>
<p>The aim is to determine how to coordinate if a bank failure occurs,
with the intent of preventing catastrophic stress on the global
financial system.</p>
<p>Yellen said several exercises have already happened.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that we will hold upcoming exchanges on operational
resilience in the financial sector and on financial stability
implications from the insurance sector’s exposure to climate risks.</p>
<p>“Just like military leaders need a hotline in a crisis,” Yellen said
“American and Chinese financial regulators must be able to communicate
to prevent financial stresses from turning into crises with tremendous
ramifications for our citizens and the international community.”</p>
<p>What she ate</p>
<p>Yellen is something of a foodie celebrity in China ever since she ate
mushrooms that can have psychedelic effects in Beijing last July. This
trip was no different.</p>
<p>High-ranking Chinese officials brought up her celebrity ahead of
important meetings — Premier Li Qiang noted in his opening remarks that
Yellen’s visit has “indeed drawn a lot of attention in society” with
media covering her trip and her dining habits. And social media was
abuzz, following her latest movements around Guangzhou and Beijing.</p>
<p>This time in Beijing, Yellen ate at Lao Chuan Ban, a popular Sichuan
restaurant. She also had lunch with Beijing Mayor Yin Yong at the
Beijing International Hotel. On Monday evening, her last night in China,
Yellen visited Jing-A Brewing Co. in Beijing — co-founded by an American
— where she ordered a Flying Fist IPA, a beer made with American
hops.</p>

id="with-6.6b-to-arizona-hub-biden-touts-big-steps-in-us-chipmaking">With
$6.6B to Arizona hub, Biden touts big steps in US chipmaking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington; Flagstaff, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Monday
announced a $6.6 billion grant to Taiwan’s top chip manufacturer to
produce semiconductors in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona, which
includes a third facility that will bring the foreign tech giant’s
investment in the state to $65 billion.</p>
<p>Biden said the move aims to perk up a decades-old slump in American
chip manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC),
which is based in the Chinese-claimed island, claims more than half of
the global market share in chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>The new facility, Biden said, will put the U.S. on track to produce
20% of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors by 2030.</p>
<p>“I was determined to turn that around, and thanks to my CHIPS and
Science Act — a key part of my Investing in America agenda —
semiconductor manufacturing and jobs are making a comeback,” Biden said
in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. production of this American-born technology has fallen steeply
in recent decades, said Andy Wang, dean of engineering at Northern
Arizona University.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we used to produce 40% of microchips for the whole
world,” he told VOA. “Now, we produce less than 10%.”</p>
<p>A single semiconductor transistor is smaller than a grain of sand.
But billions of them, packed neatly together, can connect the world
through a mobile phone, control sophisticated weapons of war and
satellites that orbit the Earth, and someday may even drive a car.</p>
<p>The immense value of these tiny chips has fueled fierce competition
between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has taken several steps to hamper
China’s efforts to build its own chip industry. Those include export
controls and new rules to prevent “foreign countries of concern” — which
it said includes China, Iran, North Korea and Russia — from benefiting
from funding from the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>
<p>While analysts are divided over whether Taiwan’s dominance of this
critical industry makes it more or less vulnerable to Chinese
aggression, they agree it confers the island significant global
status.</p>
<p>“It is debatable what, if any, role Taiwan’s semiconductor
manufacturing prowess plays in deterrence,” said David Sacks, an analyst
who focuses on U.S.-China relations at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“What is not debatable is how devastating an attack on Taiwan would be
for the global economy.”</p>
<p>Biden did not mention U.S. adversaries in his statement, but he noted
the impact of Monday’s announcement, saying it “represent(s) a broader
story for semiconductor manufacturing that’s made in America and with
the strong support of America’s leading technology firms to build the
products we rely on every day.”</p>
<p>VOA met with engineers in the new technological hub state, who said
the legislation addresses a key weakness in American chip
manufacturing.</p>
<p>“We’ve just gotten in the cycle of the last 15 to 20 years, where
innovation has slowed down,” said Todd Achilles, who teaches innovation,
strategy and policy analysis at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It’s all about financial results, investor payouts and stock buybacks.
And we’ve lost that innovation muscle. And the CHIPS Act — pulling that
together with the CHIPS Act — is the perfect opportunity to restore
that.”</p>
<p>The White House says this new investment could create 25,000
construction and manufacturing jobs. Academics say they’re churning out
workers at a rapid pace, but that still, America lacks talent.</p>
<p>“Our engineering college is the largest in the country, with over
33,000 enrolled students, and still we’re hearing from companies across
the semiconductor industry that they’re not able to get the talent they
need in time,” Zachary Holman, vice dean for research and innovation at
Arizona State University, told VOA.</p>
<p>And as the American industry stretches to keep pace, it races a
technical trend known as t: that the number of transistors in a computer
chip doubles about every two years. As a result, cutting-edge chips get
ever smaller as they grow in computing power.</p>
<p>TSMC in 2022 broke ground on a facility that makes the smallest chip
currently available, coming in at 3 nanometers — that’s just wider than
a strand of DNA.</p>

<h2
id="latino-voters-coveted-by-both-parties-are-targets-of-election-misinformation">Latino
voters, coveted by both parties, are targets of election
misinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — As ranchera music filled the Phoenix recording studio at
Radio Campesina, a station personality spoke in Spanish into the
microphone. </p>
<p>“Friends of Campesina, in these elections, truth and unity are more
important than ever,” said morning show host Tony Arias. “Don’t let
yourself be trapped by disinformation.”</p>
<p>The audio was recorded as a promo for Radio Campesina’s new campaign
aiming to empower Latino voters ahead of the 2024 elections. That effort
includes discussing election-related misinformation narratives and
fact-checking conspiracy theories on air.</p>
<p>“We are at the front lines of fighting misinformation in our
communities,” said Maria Barquin, program director of Chavez Radio
Group, the nonprofit that runs Radio Campesina, a network of
Spanish-language stations in Arizona, California and Nevada. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot at stake in 2024 for our communities. And so, we need
to amp up these efforts now more than ever.”</p>
<p>Latinos have grown at the second-fastest rate, behind Asian
Americans, of any major racial or ethnic group in the U.S. since the
last presidential election, according to a Pew Research Center analysis,
and are projected to account for 14.7%, or 36.2 million, of all eligible
voters in November, a new high. They are a growing share of the
electorate in several presidential and congressional battleground
states, including Arizona, California and Nevada, and are being heavily
courted by Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden has credited Latino voters as a key
reason he defeated Republican Donald Trump in 2020 and is urging them to
help him do it again in November. Given the high stakes of a
presidential election year, experts expect a surge of misinformation,
especially through audio and video, targeting Spanish-speaking
voters.</p>
<p>In addition to radio, much of the news and information Latinos
consume is audio-based through podcasts or social media platforms such
as Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube. Content moderation efforts in Spanish
are limited on these platforms, which are seeing a rising number of
right-wing influencers peddling election falsehoods and QAnon conspiracy
theories.</p>
<p>The types of misinformation overlap with falsehoods found in other
conservative media and many corners of the internet — conspiracy
theories about mail voting, dead people casting ballots, rigged voting
machines and threats at polling sites.</p>
<p>Other narratives are more closely tailored to Latino communities,
including false information about immigration, inflation and abortion
rights, often exploiting the traumas and fears of specific communities.
For example, Spanish speakers who have come from countries with recent
histories of authoritarianism, socialism, high inflation and election
fraud may be more vulnerable to misinformation about those topics.</p>
<p>Misinformation on the airwaves also is particularly difficult to
track and combat compared with more traditional, text-based
misinformation, said Daiquiri Ryan Mercado, strategic legal adviser and
policy counsel for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, which runs the
Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition. While misinformation
researchers can more easily code programs to categorize and track
text-based misinformation, audio often requires manual listening. Radio
stations that air only in certain areas at certain times also can be
difficult to track. </p>
<p>“When we have such limited representation, Spanish speakers feel like
they can connect to these people, and they become trusted messengers,”
Mercado said. “But some people may take advantage of that trust.”</p>
<p>Mercado and others said that’s why trusted messengers, such as Radio
Campesina, are so important. The station was founded by Mexican American
labor and civil rights leader Cesar Chavez and has built a loyal
listening base over decades. At any given moment, as many as 750,000
people are listening to the Chavez Radio Network on the air and online,
Barquin said.</p>
<p>“They will come and listen to us because of the music, but our main
focus is to empower and educate through information,” she said. “The
music is just a tactic to bring them in.”</p>
<p>Radio Campesina’s on-air talent and musical guests often discuss
misinformation on air, answering listeners’ questions about voting,
teaching them about spotting misinformation and doing tutorials on
election processes, such as how to submit mail-in ballots. The station
also has hosted rodeos and music events to register new voters and talk
about misinformation.</p>
<p>They allow listeners to call or text questions on WhatsApp, a social
media platform especially popular with immigrant communities but where
much of the misinformation they see festers. In March, the station
partnered with Mi Familia Vota, a Latino advocacy group, for an on-air
show and voter phone bank event to answer voter questions.</p>
<p>“We know that there are many people who are unmotivated because
sometimes we come from countries where, when it comes to elections, we
don’t trust the vote,” said Carolina Rodriguez-Greer, Arizona director
of Mi Familia Vota, before she shared information on the show about how
voters can track their ballots.</p>
<p>The organization began working with Spanish media outlets to dispel
misinformation after seeing candidates such as former Arizona
gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake spread election lies in 2022,
Rodriguez-Greer said. Lake is now running for the U.S. Senate with
Trump’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“One way to combat this misinformation is to fill the airways with
good information,” said Angelica Razo, national deputy director of
campaigns and programs for Mi Familia Vota.</p>
<p>A variety of other community and media groups also are prioritizing
the seemingly never-ending fight against misinformation.</p>
<p>Maritza Felix often fact-checked misinformation for her mother, whom
she calls the “Queen of WhatsApp.” This led to Felix doing the same for
family and friends in a WhatsApp group that grew into the Spanish news
nonprofit Conecta Arizona.</p>
<p>It now runs a radio show and newsletter that debunks false claims
about election processes, health, immigration and border politics.
Conecta Arizona also combats misinformation about the upcoming Mexican
presidential election that Felix said has been seeping over the
border.</p>
<p>The Spanish-language fact-checking group Factchequeado is building
partnerships with dozens of media outlets across the country to provide
training and free Spanish fact-checking content.</p>
<p>“Disinformation is at the same time a global phenomenon and a
hyperlocal phenomenon,” said Factchequeado co-founder Laura Zommer. “So,
we have to address it with local and national groups uniting
together.”</p>

<h2>
Usage example
</h2>
<p>
pl/dotnet gives you the full power of C# and F# in your PostgreSQL
procedures, functions, and triggers.
</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    upperLimit = lim.HasValue ? lim : System.Int32.MaxValue;  
    for(long i=0;i&lt;upperLimit;i++){ yield return new object?[] { i, $"Number is {i}" }; }  
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf_fsharp(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    let upperLimit = Option.defaultValue (int64 System.Int32.MaxValue) lim  
    seq { for i in 0L .. upperLimit - 1L do yield [| box i; $"Number is {i}" |] }  
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
</code></pre>
<h2>
SQL features
</h2>
<p>
We support all SQL function modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
normal procedures and functions
</li>
<li>
trigger functions, will full trigger support: trigger arguments, old/new
row, row rewriting (where allowed), and all the standard trigger
information
</li>
<li>
set-returning functions, nicely mapped to iterators in C# and sequences
in F#
</li>
<li>
table functions, as well as functions returning records or sets of
records

<h2>
Data type support
</h2>
<p>
We support 40 PostgreSQL types, with all mapped to their NPGSQL-standard
dotnet types. The only notable exceptions are multirange, enum, and
struct types, which we hope to add in the future. All datatypes are
nullable, have full array support, and are fully unit-tested for C# and
F#. (Formatted as a list of (PostgreSQL type: Dotnet type) instead of a
table for technical reasons.)

<h2>
SPI
</h2>
<p>
Our SPI leverages the NPGSQL client library to provide a native dotnet
implementation which is maximally compatible with existing client code.
We intercepted the NPGSQL calls at a very low level to replace the
client protocol handling with SPI calls; otherwise, NPGSQL was
unmodified. We imported the NPGSQL test suite as stored procedures and
are using it for our testing, giving us very good understanding of our
compatiblity level.
</p>
<p>
Work remains to improve the compatibility and add features. Our biggest
category of NPGSQL tests that continue to fail is error mapping, because
SPI throws exceptions differently than NPGSQL does. Such
incompatibilities are minor but numerous; we continue working to improve
them.
</p>
<p>
Here are our currently tested SPI operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations
<ul>
<li>
Select
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic types (including ranges)
</li>
<li>
Array types
</li>
<li>
Record
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
What we don’t have
</h2>
<p>
We lack support for multirange, enum, and composite/table types. We
intend to add them.
</p>
<p>
Our SPI implementation lacks some minor features like sub-transactions,
and we sometimes raise errors in a different (and therefore slightly
incompatible) way from NPGSQL.
</p>
<p>
Our build system, with both dpkg and binary output, is functional but
not as tidy as we would like.
</p>
<p>
We welcome code submissions to address any of these issues, and we hope
to improve them all in time.
</p>
<h2>
Where to get it
</h2>
<p>
Our operating system support:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We fully support Linux and provide dpkg’s for Debian and Ubuntu.
(Details on our
<a href="https://pldotnet.brickabode.com/how-to-install-pl-net">installation
page</a>)
</li>
<li>
We have built and tested the system on OSX (arm and x86), but we have
not packaged it yet.
</li>
<li>
We look forward to having Windows support soon; ping us if you would
like to help.
