## Biden administration aims to clean up power sector with revamped rules

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday announced it has finalized rules targeting carbon, air and water pollution from power plants that

it says could cut over 1 billion metric tons from carbon emissions by 2047 even as demand for electricity grows.


The Environmental Protection Agency tightened a proposal to slash carbon emissions from existing coal and new gas plants, and updated and finalized long-standing rules to reduce mercury and toxic air pollutants and clean up wastewater and coal ash discharge.


"EPA is cutting pollution while ensuring that power companies can make smart investments and continue to deliver reliable electricity for all Americans," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.


Regan had said in 2022 he intended to take on several regulations together to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, and help states, utilities and plant operators make better investment and plant retirement decisions.


The new rules come as electric utilities brace for a spike in demand from data centers powering technology like generative AI, as well as from the growth of electric vehicles.


The United States is projected this year to add more electric generation capacity than it has done in two decades, with 96% being clean energy, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters.


Among the changes the EPA made to the carbon rule is dropping hydrogen as a "best system of emission reduction" for gas plants to achieve new standards.


Now it is just carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) that could be used for the longest-running existing coal units and new gas turbines that run more than 40% of the time. The EPA initially proposed that the standards apply to plants that run more than 50% of the time.


The agency also said coal plants that plan to run past 2039 will be required to install CCS technology starting in 2032 in the final rule. It had initially proposed requiring CCS for plants that will be running past 2040.


The Edison Electric Institute, an investor-owned utility trade group, said it appreciated EPA's approach of bundling the different pollution rules to ease compliance, but was disappointed the agency didn't heed its concerns around CCS viability.


"CCS is not yet ready for full-scale, economy-wide deployment, nor is there sufficient time to permit, finance, and build the CCS infrastructure needed for compliance by 2032," EEI President Dan Brouillette said.


Regan told reporters the agency was confident in the technology, which has been bolstered by Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives, and support from "multiple power companies."


The agency also said it has launched a process to get feedback on how to reduce carbon emissions from existing gas plants. The EPA removed coverage of existing gas plants from the initial proposal last month and gave no new timeline for developing a rule to cover the current fleet.


The EPA also reduced mercury emissions limits for lignite coal plants by 70% and emissions limits associated with toxic metals by 67%, the first update of that rule since 2012, while also finalizing measures that would eliminate 660 million pounds of pollution per year being discharged into U.S. waterways and protect communities from coal ash contamination.


Environmental groups praised the rules for helping to drive down power sector emissions alongside the IRA, putting the administration closer to its goal of net-zero emissions in the sector by 2035.


"The age of unbridled climate pollution from power plants is over," said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.


Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said she plans to introduce a resolution aiming to overturn the rules.


"President Biden has inexplicably doubled down on his plans to shut down the backbone of America's electric grid through unachievable regulatory mandates," she said.

## The White House Also Has Some Transmission News

The White House also announced a bevy of initiatives and projects meant to bolster infrastructure throughout the country.</p><p>Transmission arguably sits at the absolute center of the Biden administration’s climate policy. Without investments to move new renewable power from where it’s sunny or windy but desolate and remote to where it’s still and cloudy but densely populated, the Inflation Reduction Act is <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-22.pdfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unlikely to meet its emissions reduction potential</u></a>. While the most important transmission policy changes will likely come from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ferc-unveil-us-power-grid-reform-may-13-2024-04-19/" target="_blank"><u>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month</u></a>, and possibly <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>permitting reform legislation under consideration in Congress</u></a>, the White House and Department of Energy are doing what they can with tens of billions of dollars allotted in both the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and their power over environmental regulations.</p><p><span></span>One such pot of money is the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/transmission-facilitation-program" target="_blank"><u>Transmission Facilitation Program</u></a>, which directs funds towards interregional transmission projects. The DOE announced Thursday that one such project, the Southwest Intertie Project-North, would get up to $331 million in funding. The almost-300 mile-long transmission line would connect wind projects in Idaho to the California electric grid. The project was conditionally approved by California regulators in December and would run from Midpoint, Idaho to Robinson Summit in Eastern Nevada, where it could connect to already operating lines that run to Las Vegas and then interconnect with California. The total costs <a href="https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/article/21279432/california-iso-approves-key-stage-of-southwest-intertie-north-project" target="_blank"><u>are estimated to run to just over $1 billion</u></a>.</p><p>“We’re building out transmission lines to get clean power from where it's generated to where it's needed,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told reporters Wednesday. The project “will increase grid resilience, especially during wildfires, and it'll create over 300 high quality and union construction jobs,” Granholm said.</p><p>The other announcements had to do with great bugbear of the energy transition: permitting. Transmission projects can take decades from conception to completion, often featuring years-long reviews, stakeholders negotiations, and lawsuits. Interregional transmission — especially in the Western United States, where much of the country’s best wind and solar resources are (along with energy-hungry populations in California and the Southwest) — often takes place on and across public lands, thus ensuring plans must undergo the federal government’s full gamut of environmental review.<br/></p><p>“Right now, it takes about four years, on average, to permit a new transmission project in the U.S., and in extreme cases it can take over a decade,” Granholm said.</p><p>To help speed that up, the DOE said it was establishing a new Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorization and Permits program, which will facilitate consultation across all relevant government bodies, “create efficiencies, and establish a standard two-year timeline for federal transmission authorizations and permits.” This would establish the DOE as “the main point of contact” for transmission developers Granholm said. This constitutes “a huge improvement from the status quo,” she added, “because developers routinely have to navigate several independent permitting processes throughout the federal government.”</p><p>Also in the same announcement (yes, it was a big one), the DOE also said it was creating a “categorical exclusion” — essentially an exemption from much of the typically required environmental review — for upgrading existing transmission lines. While there’s no way to avoid building new transmission to connect new projects, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-grid-reconductoring" target="_self"><u>existing lines could be become far more efficient</u></a>, which would go a long way toward handling the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">expected steep rise</a> in electricity demand.</p>

## The New EPA Power Plant Rules Are Out — and Could Change the Calculus for Gas

date: 2024-04-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA5NTIzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzI1MDc3NH0.WhS_lS-36mwHuZZQq2-ZJCq3gMuG-_aL-nscNBj9CTA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Utilities all over the country have proposed to build a slew of new natural gas-fired power plants in recent months, citing an anticipated surge in electricity demand from data centers, a boom in manufacturing, and the rise of electric vehicles. But on Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new emissions limits on power plants that throw many of those plans into question. </p><p>The rules require that newly built natural gas plants that are designed to help meet the grid’s daily, minimum needs, will have to slash their carbon emissions by 90% by 2032, an amount that can only be achieved with the use of carbon capture equipment. But carbon capture will be cost-prohibitive in many cases — especially in the Southeast, where <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/more-demand-more-gas-inside-the-southeasts-dirty-power-push" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much of that expected demand growth is concentrated</u></a>, but which lacks the geology necessary to store captured carbon underground. </p><p>“With this rule, it’s kind of back to square one,” Tyler Norris, an electric power systems researcher, told me. “I think most likely, you're gonna see the regulators really push back and call upon them to redo all their modeling.”</p><p>This is the first federal mandate to curb carbon from the electricity sector since President Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which never went into effect. Despite increasing investment in renewable energy, power generation is responsible for about a quarter of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the country’s greenhouse gas emissions</u></a>.</p><p>The EPA issued its original proposal for these rules more than a year ago. At the time, utilities argued that carbon capture technology was not “adequately demonstrated” and therefore should not be the basis for the rule. This argument will likely come up again in legal challenges, although the Biden administration maintains that recent federal investments in carbon capture — including an $85 tax credit for every ton of CO2 captured and stored — render it both “technically feasible and cost-reasonable.”</p><p>As part of the same announcement on Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized several additional rules to rein in air and water pollution from coal-fired power plants, including mercury and toxic metals, wastewater, and coal ash, in addition to carbon emissions. During a call with reporters on Wednesday, EPA administrator Michael Regan argued that by finalizing all of these rules at once, the agency was providing the highest degree of regulatory certainty for the power industry. “This approach is both strategic and innovative,” he said. “We are ensuring that the power sector has the information needed to prepare for the future with confidence, enabling strong investment and planning decisions.”</p><p>Initially the EPA was going to require emissions cuts at existing natural gas plants, too, but the agency announced in February that it was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/epa-power-plants-climate-change-natural-gas-coal-1499236035aa7c34dbec36a7144df25e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delaying that rule</u></a> in order to develop a “stronger, more durable approach.” On Wednesday, EPA officials offered no new details on the timeline. </p><p>The two other biggest changes the agency made between the proposed and final rules were to push forward and shorten the timeline for coal plant compliance, and to lower the threshold determining how many natural gas plants have to meet the toughest standard — which means more plants will have to control their emissions.</p><p>If the new regulations survive legal challenges (which are all but guaranteed), the agency projects they will prevent a total of nearly 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon emissions through 2047, which is about equal to the amount the power sector emits in a year. That’s significant, but it’s not quite at the same level as the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule#:~:text=The%20rules%20strengthen%20greenhouse%20gas,up%20soot%20%E2%80%94%20and%20nitrogen%20oxides." target="_self"><u>clean car rules the EPA finalized in March</u></a>, which are expected to avoid 7.2 billion metric tons of carbon between 2027 and 2055. The EPA also estimates that the power plant rules will produce $370 billion in climate and health benefits over the next two decades, in terms of avoided deaths, hospital visits, and asthma cases. </p><p>The new emissions limits for coal plants are tied to how much longer a given coal plant is slated to operate. Those that plan to shut down before 2032 are exempt altogether. Those that plan to retire by 2039 have to reduce the amount of CO2 they emit per megawatt hour by replacing some of the coal they burn with natural gas beginning in 2030. Coal plants with no plans to retire before 2039 are subject to the highest standard, requiring a 90% drop in emissions by 2032 — which would require capturing the emissions and storing them underground. </p><p>Coal plants are already shutting down at a rapid pace purely based on economics and the fact that so many of them are so old. Getting the rules in place is less about tackling coal emissions, per se, and more about “getting utilities thinking more proactive about how they are going to replace these coal plants,” Michelle Solomon, a senior policy advisor at the nonprofit think tank Energy Innovation, told me.</p><p>Gas, however, is another story. Utilities have been sounding the alarm about a coming surge in electricity demand. Electric companies throughout the Southeast, as well as Texas, Wisconsin, and elsewhere, have proposed building dozens of new natural gas plants, arguing that renewables and batteries aren’t up to the task of providing a reliable, dispatchable source of power.</p><p>Clean energy researchers and advocates dispute the idea that gas plants are needed for reliability. (Whether that coming demand is real or inflated is also a <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-energy-consumption" target="_self"><u>matter of debate</u></a>.) </p><p>“Utilities are seeing an additional need for peak capacity, not an additional need for capacity throughout the day,” Solomon told me, asserting it was possible to meet those peaks with solar and storage, or even by improving efficiency so that the peaks aren’t as high. The trick is making sure we can bring those resources online fast enough. To that end, the Department of Energy also announced a number of initiatives to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-power-grid-transmission" target="_self"><u>boost transmission infrastructure</u></a> on Thursday. </p><p>The EPA’s regulations for new gas plants are tied to how frequently they are intended to operate. Plants that are designed to switch on during times of peak demand — a variety called a “simple cycle” combustion turbine plant — won’t have to do anything differently. Plants that run a bit more often — so-called “intermediate” resources that might run daily from mid-morning till the evening, at 20% to 40% of their annual capacity — will be required to install the most efficient equipment available on the market. Any that operate more frequently than that will be subject to the 90% emissions reduction standard by 2032. This primarily affects “combined cycle” plants, which are more efficient than single cycle but can’t ramp up and down as quickly or easily.</p><p>Utilities with recently hatched plans to build single cycle plants, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-approval-plant-yates-irp/713404/" target="_blank"><u>including Georgia Power</u></a>, are unlikely to be affected by the rule at all. “I do think that makes sense, given the focus of these rules, which are on carbon emissions,” Amanda Levin, a director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “Given the frequency and type of operation for [single cycle], they're not as significant as sources of CO2.” </p><p>But utilities planning to build combined cycle projects — and many of them are — could be forced to go back to the drawing board. Norris noted that Duke Energy, which serves customers in North and South Carolina, and has proposed building more than 6 gigawatts of combined cycle capacity, will be especially affected.</p><p>For combined cycle plants, there are essentially two options to comply: Install carbon capture, or plan to run your plant a lot less frequently. In either case, it “dramatically increases the levelized cost of those units,” Norris told me. “So I think any reasonable regulator would say we've got to go back and do a much more rigorous comparative analysis to other least-cost solutions.”</p><p>Solomon has a more cynical view of the recent panic over electricity demand and rush to build new gas plants. “We've known that demand is growing, is going to grow, for a long time,” she told me. “The fact that there’s quite a lot of news about this just as the rules are coming out is unlikely to be a total coincidence.”</p>

## Blinken kicks off direct engagement with China ahead of tough talks

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken underscored the necessity for "direct" and "sustained engagement" between the United States and China during his first official meeting in Shanghai, a city home to more than 1,000 U.S. companies.


Thursday morning, Blinken held talks with Chen Jining, Chinese Communist Party Secretary for Shanghai. Chen is the highest-ranking local official and is a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.


Blinken said he would lay out "our differences, which are real" but seek to "work through them" as well as to "build cooperation where we can."


Welcoming the Secretary to Shanghai at the city’s Grand Halls, Chen said through a translator that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between the two nations has not always been smooth, there's always been "twists and turns," "but overall, it has progressed with historical development and progressed forward."


Blinken was last in Shanghai in 2015 when he was deputy secretary of state.


"In a constructive and candid exchange, the secretary raised concerns about PRC trade policies and non-market economic practices and stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China," said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  He was referring to People’s Republic of China.


During a discussion with American and Chinese students from New York University Shanghai, Blinken underscored the importance of expanding exchanges between students, scholars, and business.


"We need to make sure that we are talking to each other, hearing each other, understanding each other," he said.


According to the State Department, the NYU Shanghai student body currently consists of nearly 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, half of whom are from China. Students from the United States and some 70 other countries represent the other half.  There are approximately 500 U.S. students.


Later Thursday, Blinken met with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, advocating for the resolution of a range of trade issues facing the world’s two largest economies.


In a brief video, Blinken said late Wednesday he is in China “to make progress on issues that matter most to the American people, including curbing fentanyl trafficking,” against the backdrop of Shanghai's skyline. He added that officials from the U.S. and China will also discuss other areas where the two countries have "significant disagreements."




While Washington and Beijing are divided over a range of thorny issues, Blinken began his visit to China this week focusing first on the importance of direct engagement. It is something, he says, is essential for addressing key issues affecting people from both countries and the world. 


Analysts told VOA Blinken's visit will surface a range of contentious issues but also maintain "the tactical thaw" that gained momentum following U.S. President Joe Biden's face-to-face talks with PRC President Xi Jinping last November.


"The relationship continues to grow more competitive militarily, technologically, and diplomatically, but the increase is occurring in a more predictable, controlled manner than it was a year earlier due to both countries' continued investment in high-level diplomacy," Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy adviser for International Crisis Group, told VOA Mandarin in an email.


Intensive diplomacy between Washington and Beijing has yielded little progress in curtailing China's supply of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that affects the United States.  Strains are escalating due to China's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine, prompting the U.S. to warn further actions against China.


"I'm very pessimistic about this visit. Xi Jinping is committed to helping his close friend Putin and will not be very responsive to America's requests," Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA Mandarin.


A day before Blinken departed for Shanghai, he unveiled the State Department's annual report on human rights practices, which said that the PRC government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  Blinken told reporters that he would raise the issue of human rights with the Beijing government.


Blinken is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing Friday afternoon.


The State Department said Blinken will hold a press conference in Beijing before returning to Washington.

This morning, President Joe Biden signed into law the $95 billion national security supplemental bill providing military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as humanitarian aid to Gaza and other peoples suffering humanitarian crises. The Pentagon immediately sent about a billion dollars worth of ammunition, air defense munitions, and artillery rounds, as well as weapons and armored vehicles to Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense had moved supplies into Poland and Germany in hopes that the measure would pass; they should move into Ukraine soon.

## US police clash with students who demand colleges cut financial ties to Israel

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

austin, texas — Police tangled with student demonstrators in the U.S. states of Texas and California while new encampments sprouted Wednesday at Harvard and other colleges as school leaders sought ways to defuse a growing wave of pro-Palestinian protests.


At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police — including some on horseback and holding batons — clashed with protesters, pushing them off the campus lawn and at one point sending some tumbling into the street. At least 20 demonstrators were taken into custody at the request of university officials and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, according to the state Department of Public Safety.


A photographer covering the demonstration for Fox 7 Austin was arrested after being caught in a push-and-pull between law enforcement and students, the station confirmed. A longtime Texas journalist was knocked down in the mayhem and could be seen bleeding before police helped him to emergency medical staff who bandaged his head.


At the University of Southern California, police got into a back-and-forth tugging match with protesters over tents, removing several before falling back. At the northern end of California, students were barricaded inside a building for a third day at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. The school shut down campus through the weekend and made classes virtual.


Harvard University in Massachusetts had sought to stay ahead of protests this week by limiting access to Harvard Yard and requiring permission for tents and tables. That didn't stop protesters from setting up a camp with 14 tents Wednesday following a rally against the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.


Students protesting the Israel-Hamas war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling its monthslong conflict. Dozens have been arrested on charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.




Columbia University averted another confrontation between students and police earlier in the day. The situation there remained tense, with campus officials saying it would continue talks with protesters for another 48 hours.


On a visit to campus, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, called on Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign "if she cannot bring order to this chaos."


"If this is not contained quickly and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, there is an appropriate time for the National Guard," he said.


Shafik had set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an agreement on clearing an encampment, but the school extended negotiations, saying it was making "important progress."


On Wednesday evening, a Columbia spokesperson said rumors that the university had threatened to bring in the National Guard were unfounded. "Our focus is to restore order, and if we can get there through dialogue, we will," said Ben Chang, Columbia's vice president for communications.


Columbia graduate student Omer Lubaton Granot, who put up pictures of Israeli hostages near the encampment, said he wanted to remind people that there were more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas.




"I see all the people behind me advocating for human rights," he said. "I don't think they have one word to say about the fact that people their age, that were kidnapped from their homes or from a music festival in Israel, are held by a terror organization."


Harvard law student Tala Alfoqaha, who is Palestinian, said she and other protesters want more transparency from the university.


"My hope is that the Harvard administration listens to what its students have been asking for all year, which is divestment, disclosure and dropping any sort of charges against students," she said.




Columbia encampment inspires others


Police first tried to clear the encampment at Columbia last week, when they arrested more than 100 protesters. The move backfired, acting as an inspiration for other students across the country to set up similar encampments and motivating protesters at Columbia to regroup.


On Wednesday about 60 tents remained at the Columbia encampment, which appeared calm. Security remained tight around campus, with identification required and police setting up metal barricades.


Columbia said it had agreed with protest representatives that only students would remain at the encampment and they would make it welcoming, banning discriminatory or harassing language.


On the University of Minnesota campus, a few dozen students rallied a day after nine protesters were arrested when police took down an encampment in front of the library. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, whose daughter was among the demonstrators arrested at Columbia last week, attended a protest later in the day.


A group of more than 80 professors and assistant professors signed a letter Wednesday calling on the university's president and other administrators to drop any charges and to allow future encampments without what they described as police retaliation.


They wrote that they were "horrified that the administration would permit such a clear violation of our students' rights to freely speak out against genocide and ongoing occupation of Palestine."


Netanyahu encourages police response


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. college campuses in a video statement released Wednesday, saying the response of several university presidents has been "shameful" and calling on state, local and federal officials to intervene.


Students at some protests were hiding their identities and declined to identify themselves to reporters, saying they feared retribution. At an encampment of about 40 tents at the heart of the University of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor, almost every student wore a mask, which was handed to them when they entered.


The upwelling of demonstrations has left universities struggling to balance campus safety with free speech rights. Many long tolerated the protests, but are now doling out more heavy-handed discipline, citing safety concerns.


At New York University this week, police said 133 protesters were taken into custody and all had been released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges. More than 40 protesters were arrested Monday at an encampment at Yale University.

## Columbia University demonstrators in talks with administration officials

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Officials at Columbia University were continuing talks Wednesday with student demonstrators from the Gaza Solidarity Encampment as the protest reaches a full week.


At 9:41 p.m. Tuesday, university President Nemat “Minouche” Shafik sent an email to the Columbia community setting a midnight deadline for an agreement to be reached about dismantling the encampment and dispersing the protesters.


“I very much hope these discussions are successful,” she wrote. “If they are not, we will have to consider alternative options for clearing the West Lawn and restoring calm to campus so that students can complete the term and graduate.”




As midnight passed, Columbia University Apartheid Divest posted a statement on X saying, “We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest.”


The statement also said the university had threatened to call the National Guard. But after visiting the university earlier in the week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said Tuesday she had no plans to deploy the National Guard.


As midnight approached on Tuesday, a student organizer announced that the deadline had been extended to 8 a.m. Wednesday.


At 4:09 a.m., the Office of the President sent an email saying the discussion deadline would be extended for 48 hours, given the constructive dialogue, and the university would report back on progress.


The email announced that leaders of the student encampment had agreed to remove a significant number of tents, get non-Columbia affiliates to leave the encampment and comply with New York Fire Department requirements. They also agreed to ensure that the encampment is “welcome to all” and to prohibit “discriminatory or harassing language.”


This development comes nearly a week after more than 100 students were arrested at the school on April 18, after Shafik authorized police to clear away protesters. Some of the students received suspension notices from the school.


Columbia’s action prompted an onslaught of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at other universities and responses from faculty and politicians.


Students at other campuses, such as Yale, Stanford and New York University, have also rallied around the Palestinian cause, calling for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel and for a cease-fire in Gaza. Many also have put up tent encampments on their campuses. About 150 students and faculty were arrested at New York University Monday night.


Columbia also announced Tuesday morning that classes on the Morningside main campus, where the protests are taking place, will be offered in a hybrid format for the remainder of the spring semester. The last day of classes is April 29.

U.S. President Joe Biden is making reproductive rights a centerpiece of his re-election campaign, blaming opponent Donald Trump for opening the way to stricter state abortion laws. In this presidential campaign, Trump is pursuing a more moderate position on abortion than other Republicans. Scott Stearns reports.

## Arizona House sends repeal of state's near-total abortion ban to Senate

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX — A proposed repeal of Arizona's near-total ban on abortions won approval Wednesday from the state House after two weeks of mounting pressure on Republicans over an issue that has bedeviled former President Donald Trump's campaign to return to the White House. 


Three Republicans joined in with all 29 Democrats to vote to repeal a law that predated Arizona's statehood and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. If the Senate approves as expected, Arizona would allow abortions up to 15 weeks. 


Their political ambitions imperiled by widespread opposition to a near-total abortion ban, Trump and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake had urged Arizona lawmakers to ease the restrictions. But until Wednesday, most state House Republicans repeatedly used procedural votes to block repeal, each time drawing condemnation from Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made his support for abortion rights central to his reelection campaign. 


"Make no mistake, Arizonans are living in 1864 now because Donald Trump dismantled Roe v. Wade," Democratic state Senator Priya Sundareshan of Tucson said in a news conference before the vote. It was organized by the Biden campaign and the Arizona Democratic Party. 


Arizona is one of a handful of battleground states that will decide the next president. Trump, who has warned that the issue could lead to Republican losses, has avoided endorsing a national abortion ban but said he's proud to have appointed the Supreme Court justices who allowed states to outlaw the procedure. 


Arizona Republicans have been under intense pressure from some conservatives in their base, who firmly support the abortion ban, even as it's become a liability with swing voters who will decide crucial races including the presidency, the U.S. Senate and the GOP's control of the Legislature. 


"I am disgusted today," said Republican Representative Rachel Jones, who voted against repeal. "Life is one of the tenets of our Republican platform. To see people go back on that value is egregious to me." 




State Representative Matt Gress, one of the three Republicans who crossed party lines to support the repeal measure, said in a statement that the near-total abortion ban was "unworkable and out of line with the values of Arizonans." GOP Representative Tim Dunn said his vote in favor of repeal was "the most pro-life vote I could possibly make" because, he said, backlash to the total ban would lead voters to support abortion even after 15 weeks. 


The other Republican who supported the repeal measure, state Representative Justin Wilmeth, didn't return an email and phone call seeking comment on the vote. 


The Arizona Supreme Court concluded this month that the state could enforce the long-dormant law that permits abortions only to save the pregnant patient's life. The ruling suggested doctors could be prosecuted under the law first approved in 1864, which carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for anyone who assists in an abortion. 


The law had been blocked since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide. 


After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, convinced a state judge that the 1864 ban could be enforced. The law hasn't been enforced while the case was making its way through the courts. Brnovich's Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, urged the state's high court against reviving the law. 


Mayes has said the earliest the law could be enforced is June 8. But the anti-abortion-rights group defending the ban, Alliance Defending Freedom, maintains county prosecutors can begin enforcing it once the Supreme Court's decision becomes final, which is expected to occur this week. 


If the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs, a 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law. Even so, there would likely be a period where all abortions are outlawed, because the repeal won't take effect until 90 days after the end of the legislative session, likely in midsummer. 


Advocates are collecting signatures for a ballot measure allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks, with exceptions — to save the parent's life, or to protect her physical or mental health. 


Republican lawmakers, in turn, are considering putting one or more competing abortion proposals on the November ballot.

## Arizona indicts nearly 20 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX — An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.


The indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.


The Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.


One is described as an attorney "who was often identified as the Mayor" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's " chief of staff in 2020," which describes Meadows.


"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined," Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. "It's too important."


The 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were "duly elected and qualified" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.


Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.


Their lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and "failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims."


Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.


The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.


In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.


Michigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.


Three fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.


In Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.


Trump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.


In early January, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.


In Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.


In another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.


The Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.


None of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.

## Russia blocks UN resolution on peaceful use of outer space

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

new york — Russia blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution Wednesday reaffirming the need to prevent a nuclear arms race in outer space.


The measure was proposed jointly by the United States, a nuclear power, and Japan, the only nation ever to be attacked with nuclear bombs.


“We have only begun to understand the catastrophic ramifications of a nuclear explosion in space,” said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “How it could destroy thousands of satellites operated by countries and companies around the world — and wipe out the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial and national security services we all depend on.”


The failed text recalled the responsibility of states to comply with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which is the basic framework on international space law. It says outer space is to be shared among nations and shall be free of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. The treaty also says the moon and other celestial bodies “shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes,” and astronauts shall be “regarded as the envoys of mankind.”


The proposed resolution also called on states “not to develop nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction specifically designed to be placed in orbit around the Earth, or to be installed on celestial bodies, or to be stationed in outer space in any other manner.”


Thomas-Greenfield noted that President Vladimir Putin has said publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space.


“And so, today’s veto begs the question: Why? Why, if you are following the rules, would you not support a resolution that reaffirms them?” she asked. “What could you possibly be hiding? It's baffling, and it’s a shame.”


Thomas-Greenfield just returned from Japan, where she visited Nagasaki, a city on which the United States dropped one of two atomic bombs at the end of World War II.


“It was a reminder of our profound responsibility to prevent the scourge of war and ensure that no place experiences the horror of nuclear weaponry ever again,” she said.


“Adopting this draft resolution would have been a positive and practical contribution to the promotion of the peaceful use and exploration of outer space,” said Japanese Ambassador Kazuyuki Yamazaki. “If adopted, we could have demonstrated our unity in reaffirming the principle of no placement of any weapons of mass destruction in outer space and in opposing the development of such capabilities.”


The proposed resolution, which had more than 60 co-sponsors, created no new international obligations, but reaffirmed existing ones. It was supported by 13 of the 15 council members. After failing to get an amendment added to it, Russia vetoed it and China abstained.


“Today, our council is once again being involved in a dirty spectacle prepared by the U.S. and Japan,” Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. “This is a cynical ploy. We are being tricked.”


He said Moscow wanted a text that would have gone further, banning weapons of any kind in outer space.


China’s new U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, echoed that, saying the draft needed “other substantive elements.” 


US concerns


In February, U.S. officials said Russia is developing a space-based weapon to attack satellites. They do not believe it would target people or cause destruction on Earth.


Analysts at the Washington-based Safe World Foundation think tank say on their website that Russia is most likely developing a system “that would use a nuclear explosion to create weapons effects, most likely an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), that would in turn disable or destroy satellites.”


There are thousands of satellites in space that run the gamut from sophisticated military purposes to running a car’s GPS or providing television programming.


Although the U.S. resolution was not adopted, Thomas-Greenfield said Washington would continue to pursue bilateral arms control discussions with Russia in good faith.


The U.S. also has concerns about China’s work in space, where officials say they are rapidly developing a range of counterspace weapons and using outer space to strengthen the capabilities of their military forces on Earth.


“Over the last six years they have tripled the number of intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance satellites in orbit, and they have used their space capabilities to improve the lethality, the precision and the range of their terrestrial forces,” said General Stephen Whiting, commander of the U.S. Space Command.


He spoke by phone to regional journalists Wednesday from Tokyo, where he is meeting with allies.

## Google postpones phasing out third party cookies in Chrome once more

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

While Firefox and Safari phased out third party cookies years ago, it&#8217;s taking Chrome a bit longer because, well, daddy Google got ads to sell. As such, Google has been developing a complicated new alternative to third party cookies that it calls &#8220;Privacy sandbox&#8221;, a name in the vain of &#8220;Greenland&#8221;. This process has not exactly been going well, because Google has had to postpone phasing out third party cookies several times now, and today, they had to postpone it again. This time, however, it&#8217;s because the UK competition authority, the CMA, still has some questions. We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June. Given both of these significant considerations, we will not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4. We remain committed to engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to conclude that process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year. ↫ Google&#8217;s Greenland blog Making a browser good enough to take over almost the entire browser market was an absolute master stroke by Google.

## Biden signs measure aimed at targeting Captagon trade in Syria

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

Washington   — Largely overlooked in the massive foreign aid package signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday is a measure that targets the trafficking of a dangerous drug in Syria. 


The Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act is part of the package providing military and other aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It provides for new sanctions against individuals, entities and networks affiliated with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who produce and traffic Captagon.   


Captagon is an addictive, amphetamine-like drug that is cheaply produced. Since the beginning of Syria’s civil war in 2011, the country has become a regional hub for the production and smuggling of Captagon. 


“This is a good step towards accountability and hindering and dismantling Assad’s illicit drug trade in Syria and the Middle East,” the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in a statement.  


The measure is seen as a continuation of previous congressional actions that have targeted the growing Captagon trade in Syria.  


Mohammed Alaa Ghanem, policy chief of the American Coalition for Syria, said the new measure was sought by the Syrian American community “to address Assad’s pervasive involvement in the Captagon drug trade, which has tragically transformed Syria into a narco-state.” 


“We are encouraged by the enactment of this bill into law,” Ghanem told VOA in an email. “Its inclusion in the comprehensive legislative package which was signed by the president into law highlights Congress' dedication to the objectives laid out in the original Captagon Act that Congress passed in Dec 2022.”  


The bill was introduced to Congress by Republican Representative French Hill from Arkansas, who said Wednesday on X, “With my bill now signed into law, those directly involved with the proliferation of this dangerous drug will be targeted and sanctioned. 


“It’s crucial that we take further action to disrupt and dismantle the production and trafficking of captagon as it generates billions of illicit funding for the Assad regime and devastates families in the region,” he said.   


Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, two major backers of the Syrian government, have also been involved in drug trafficking in Syria. Observers say the trade also has funded Tehran’s military activities in the region.   


Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots Portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said the bill is part of a broader U.S. strategy that seeks to curb Captagon trafficking and production in the Middle East.  


“We have seen two rounds of sanctions against Captagon agents imposed by the U.S. Treasury in the last two years, so this will keep the pressure on the U.S. inter-agency strategy to identify more eligible Captagon producers and traffickers to target,” she said.

## American Solar Is in a Trade War With Itself

On one side are the companies that develop, finance, and install solar systems. On the other, the American (or American-located) companies that manufacture them.</p><p>China’s solar panel industry has been a combination of boon and bugaboo for American renewable energy efforts for years. On the one hand, the solar development sector has benefitted from the cheap panels they have happily put up on roofs and in fields across the country, underpinning the massive growth of solar power in the past decade.</p><p>And then on the other there’s the still-nascent American solar manufacturing industry (<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-solar-will-qcells-new-plant-usher-in-an-american-made-solar-revival/OCKGUCKVNZAERMSJZVJVSA5NGU/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and a South Korean company with a substantial facility in Georgia</u></a>), which joined together to file petitions with the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission Wednesday, beseeching them to investigate what it argues are violations of trade laws by Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers in Southeast Asia.</p><p>The group claims that China’s <a href="https://americansolartradecmte.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80% market share in solar products</u></a> is a “near monopoly” underpinned by “unfair trade practices,” including subsidies and selling at below-cost. About two-thirds of installed solar panels come from overseas, the group claims, “with the majority arriving without safeguard measures or tariffs from China via Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.” The Southeast Asian imports the petition targets are worth some $12 billion annually. </p><p>“America’s solar manufacturing industry is on the cusp of tremendous growth that will create jobs and change the trajectory of our clean energy transition for decades to come,” Tim Brightbill, a lawyer representing the group, <a href="https://www.wiley.law/pressrelease-Wiley-Files-Trade-Petitions-for-Leading-US-Solar-Manufacturers-to-Combat-Chinas-Illegal-and-Harmful-Trade-Practices-in-Vietnam-Malaysia-Cambodia-and-Thailand" target="_blank"><u>said in a release</u></a>. “However, this manufacturing renaissance is being threatened by China’s industrial policy, which has led to massive subsidization in China and Southeast Asia.”<br/></p><p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>The solar manufacturers’ petition comes as a two-year moratorium on tariffs against Chinese solar panels is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/solar-groups-lobby-biden-to-head-off-sector-roiling-trade-case" target="_blank"><u>due to expire next month</u></a>. Solar developers had been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/solar-groups-lobby-biden-to-head-off-sector-roiling-trade-case" target="_blank"><u>lobbying the White House</u></a> to boost other kinds of support for American solar manufacturing, hoping to head off any push for new tariffs, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported. But according to <em>Reuters</em>, the administration is inclined to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-plans-restore-tariffs-dominant-solar-technology-sources-say-2024-04-17/" target="_blank">take the protectionist side</a>.</p><p>“Reducing reliance on Chinese clean energy imports, such as solar panels, is among the most bipartisan issues within clean energy,” Morningstar analyst Brett Castelli wrote in a note. For Republicans, China‘s solar dominance represents yet another strategic asset controlled by an adversary state. For Democrats, they are choking off a burgeoning American manufacturing sector.</p><p>And yet the question is not as simple as support U.S. solar or don’t. The likely “tightening of solar panel imports into the U.S. would benefit First Solar,” an American solar manufacturer that’s part of the petitioning group, Castelli wrote, “while being a net negative for the rest of our solar sector coverage.”</p><p>The Biden administration has long put itself squarely behind American solar. The Inflation Reduction Act’s advanced manufacturing production credit subsidizes domestic renewable energy manufacturing in the United States, while Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-china-climate" target="_self"><u>criticized</u></a> Chinese “overcapacity” in renewable energy technology. On the installer side, there are tax credits and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/solar-for-all-ira">subsidy programs</a> to make solar more affordable to individuals. </p><p><span></span>While the solar manufacturers certainly are not unhappy with their tax credits, they see action on trade as an existential issue. </p><p>“Everyone knows these Chinese-headquartered companies in Southeast Asia are benefiting from subsidies and exporting below-cost solar into the U.S. market, harming American solar manufacturers and their workers,” Mike Carr, the executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said in a statement. “Conditions are untenable for American solar manufacturers.”</p><p>Other renewable energy trade groups — The American Council on Renewable Energy, the American Clean Power Association, and Advanced Energy United — call tariffs a threat to clean energy deployment. The manufacturers’ petition “creates market uncertainty in the U.S. solar industry and poses a potential threat to the build-out of a domestic solar supply chain,” the groups said in a statement, which also noting that they support a “strong domestic solar supply chain,” and specifically the tax credits that encourage onshore production of solar panels.</p><p>But while trade groups lament the stoking of trade war to anyone who will listen, companies — or at least one very big company — is telling its investors that things are going to be OK.</p><p>NextEra, one of the country’s largest renewable energy developers and operators, has been telling investors and analysts that the petitions and potential tariffs would not be a big deal.</p><p>“We expect that any trade actions that would occur this time around will be very manageable,” NextEra CEO John Ketchum said on the company’s quarterly earnings call Tuesday. The company didn’t expect any potential trade restriction “to result in delivery stoppages,” he added, and since NextEra orders panels well before actual construction on a project commences, that “gives us a lot of time and opportunity to be able to troubleshoot any issues should they arise,” Ketchum said.</p><p>Finally, even if there were new tariffs, the gap in cost between domestic and overseas panels – the exact thing that the solar manufacturers and the Biden administration lament — is so large that “there’s a lot of economic reasons for deliveries to continue to occur.” Even a 15% tariff  on Chinese solar panels, Ketchum said, would be “quite manageable.”</p><p>While everyone says they want an American solar manufacturing industry to succeed, trade protection and tax credits can only go so far. </p>

## No longer a US priority, is Afghanistan a Central Asia problem now?

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbors are holding out hope that America, based on its pledges at September’s C5+1 summit, will expand its role in this neighborhood. The wish list includes delivering more humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, facilitating the expansion of trade, and combating the threats of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. 


Officials speaking with VOA suggest that more aid could be channeled into Afghanistan via Uzbekistan. Additionally, Washington could offer more military assistance to Central Asian states and tangibly support their regional connectivity initiatives. 


While no country has formally announced diplomatic recognition of the Taliban government, Central Asian nations have been engaging with the Taliban based on mutual interests, such as security, trade, and water sharing. Uzbekistan, which has extensive political and economic ties with Kabul, has been urging the West and the larger international community not to isolate Afghanistan. 




Nearly three years since the withdrawal of American forces, U.S. officials insist that they have not abandoned Afghanistan, pointing to ongoing efforts and consultations with Central Asian counterparts. However, they admit Washington’s priorities have shifted to other issues, such as Russia’s war on Ukraine. 


“It will take the U.S. a decade or two to recover from the fact that we lost the war,” said David Sedney, a veteran diplomat and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia. “It took us 20 years before we were able to engage in Vietnam in a productive way,” he told VOA. 




Scott Worden, who heads the Afghanistan and Central Asia programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, thinks that Central Asian governments overestimate Washington’s leverage. 


“There are a lot of issues in the world that have to be addressed simultaneously,” he noted in an interview with VOA. “They [the U.S.] are balancing the leverage that they have against issues that are manageable and maybe achievable versus ones like women's rights, which I think the administration cares strongly about.” 


“It's just a really tough situation,” Worden added. “In my view, you should not condition humanitarian assistance. Any economic sanctions wind up hurting the Afghans that we want to support. It's a difficult balance, and so I don't think there is any obvious additional tool or leverage that could be deployed that they're withholding.” 




Some Western nations including the United States, however, have filtered humanitarian aid programs through partner organizations that circumvent Taliban officials and deliver aid directly to Afghan civilians.


According to USAID, the U.S. supplied nearly $81 million in Afghan humanitarian aid in fiscal year 2024, and has supplied total funding for Afghanistan of "more than $2 billion since August 2021 ... including more than $1.5 billion in [USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance] funding and nearly $550 million in [the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration] funding." 


“Provided through international partners on the ground,” says USAID, this assistance helps “meet the needs of the most vulnerable through food and cash support, nutrition, health care, protection for women and children, and agricultural inputs to support Afghans in meeting their immediate food needs.” 




Like Sedney, Worden suggests being realistic. “There is ample opportunity for the U.S. and other international partners to talk to the Taliban when they want to.” 


“This is all part of a very difficult global conversation,” he said. 


But for Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, known for advocating closer ties with the region, Afghanistan is “utterly ignored right now.” 


Starr emphasizes that this country is critical for regional integration and stability, two goals the U.S. has long vowed to support. 


Sedney observes that "not many people want to talk about Afghanistan," not just in Washington but in other Western capitals as well. 


Speaking last week at the American Foreign Policy Council, these experts stressed that America’s two decades of involvement in Afghanistan left it with an obligation to go beyond the status quo. 


Starr approves of the steps Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have taken with Afghanistan, particularly regarding commerce, energy supply and water resources. 




Other observers, however, warn about tensions between the Taliban and Tajikistan, which officially supports the National Resistance Front, an armed alliance of anti-Taliban forces that is loyal to the previous regime and carries out guerrilla attacks in Afghanistan. Dushanbe continues to host the previous government’s ambassador. 




Worden identifies several key interests and objectives for Washington, most of which align with those of the region. The first and most important objective is counterterrorism, ensuring that Afghan territory is never again used to launch attacks on the U.S. or its allies. 


Others include negotiations on American hostages; the evacuation of Afghans that the U.S. promised to help following its withdrawal; women's rights and other human rights; humanitarian assistance; and economic development. 


Perhaps the most abstract interest, according to Worden, “is trying to maintain an international diplomatic consensus on the broad conditions and expectations that we have for the Taliban, which include in the endgame a more inclusive society that is not a threat to itself and for its neighbors as well as these U.S. interests.” 


“It's remarkable that no country in the world has recognized the Taliban,” he said, adding, however, that he sees a divergence between Western-allied emphasis on human rights and women's rights and the neighboring countries’ economic and security concerns. 


In Worden’s view, the U.S. is pursuing a policy of “quiet engagement” on humanitarian assistance and counterterrorism. At the same time, there is a firm position of non-recognition and not wanting to legitimize the Taliban. 


“Can this dualism sustain over time?” asked Worden, who also sees a cleavage developing, where countries in the region will over time increase engagement with those in power in Afghanistan to achieve their economic and security interests. “Not that they like the Taliban, but they feel like talking to them is better than not.” 




Regardless of who inhabits the White House next January, Worden doubts that U.S. attention toward Afghanistan will increase unless there is an “acute crisis.” 


Republicans tend to “prefer coercion to engagement when you're talking about regimes that we don't have much in common with,” he said. “So yes, there is the wild card of potentially making a great deal, but I think the odds of support for armed opposition would increase.” 


U.S.-based Afghan journalist Samy Mahdi, who runs Amu Television out of Virginia, points out that the Taliban enjoy close relations with America’s adversaries, such as Iran, Russia and China. He argues that U.S. assistance has brought about minimum results, and that the Taliban is as radical and dangerous as it was in the 1990s. 


Mahdi recommends a full review of U.S. policy. 


“More communication and transparency are needed on Afghanistan,” he said at the American Foreign Policy Council forum. “We don't hear much from the U.S. administration about Afghanistan.”

Vexed by their <a href="https://www.platformer.news/anxious-generation-jonathan-haidt-debate-critique/?ref=platformer-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emotionally ruinous</u></a> smartphone addiction, plenty of people, including those of the tech-savvy younger generations, are turning their backs on iPhones and Androids to embrace internet-free cellphones that walked right out of the 1990s.</p>
<p>The impossibility of TikTok is not the dumbphone’s only winning feature. Flagship smartphones are expensive and delicate. Despite Apple’s soft cooing about the iPhone’s beautiful facade, you must shield that design behind a plastic case at all times, lest you drop your $1,200 investment and ruin it. Dumbphones, though, are rugged and cheap. They do their job without fuss or pretense. They are an appliance, and they know it.</p>
<p>This attitude needs to come to electric cars.</p>
<p>Ever since the rise of Tesla, it’s become a popular cliche to say electric vehicles are just <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Sony-Honda-s-Afeela-EV-takes-smartphone-on-wheels-a-step-further" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>smartphones on wheels</u></a>, closer in spirit to the devices of Silicon Valley than to the combustion cars of Detroit. The comparison is apt. In addition to running on a large lithium-ion battery, today’s EVs are typically controlled through massive touchscreens. They are reliant upon software that receives over-the-air updates to fix its bugs and upgrade its features, just like your phone.</p>
<p>Like your mobile device, today’s EVs tend to present themselves as closed boxes not to be tinkered with. Some people go to the trouble of fixing a cracked screen or a withered battery to keep their smartphone running longer. For the most part, though, the tech giants have convinced people over the past two decades that phones should be replaced, not repaired, once they start to show their age. </p>
<p>Positioning EVs as fancy gadgets was a natural strategy to get Americans to lust after them, and to differentiate them from the gas-powered vehicles that came from an analog age. And it’s not hard to see why electric car makers would be keen to copy the “replace-don’t-repair” dynamic that arose around phones (to say nothing of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/13/23206999/car-subscription-nightmare-heated-seats-remote-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>subscription creep</u></a> that will ask you to pay extra monthly fees for car features). </p>
<p>But there’s no rule that says it must be this way. Electric cars don’t <em><em>have</em></em> to be defined by smartphone aesthetics and touchscreens and proprietary software; they don’t have to present as impenetrable to the garage mechanic. There is a better world where they are not only less expensive but also purposefully modular and obviously repairable, where parts, including the battery, could be swapped in to keep the car on the road as long as possible. They could feel rugged, like an old Buick LeSabre that just runs forever, rather than fragile and disposable.</p>
<p>I’m not just harping on this because America needs a simpler, more affordable EV to help the transition to electric. It’s also a sustainability issue. Gas-powered cars have grown more reliable and long-lasting over the years, and their increasing longevity means the average auto could be <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/what-is-a-reasonable-life-span-for-a-modern-car-a4678774857/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected</u></a> to reach 12 years and 200,000 miles, with lots of fluids, belts, brake pads, spark plugs, and cracked gaskets replaced along the way. They just keep on chugging, and emitting.</p>
<p>Electric cars are mechanically simpler. So it’s possible that, if their major components could be easily replaced, the vehicles themselves could last even longer, like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric car of Theseus</u></a>. It’s been done, even with today’s EVs. A 10-year-old Tesla Model S in Europe reportedly just <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/699413/highest-mileage-tesla-model-s-3-batteries-14-motors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>surpassed</u></a> 2 million kilometers, or about 1.24 million miles on the odometer. The EV has been through four battery packs and <em><em>14</em></em> motors to reach that wild total.</p><p>Few EV owners will go this hard to keep their vehicle on the road, but plenty of them will be presented with a simpler choice. The battery warranty of a current EV typically expires at 100,000 miles, and guarantees only that the pack won’t suffer more than 30 percent degradation during that time. Afterward, you’re on your own. So when a battery goes kaput at 150,000 miles, or has lost half its original range, EV drivers will face the classic car conundrum: whether to sink more money into an old car or buy a new one.</p><p>If the cost of batteries and motors really does <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/03/15/goldman-sachs-ev-battery-prices-falling" target="_blank"><u>fall</u></a> in the near future once EVs go mainstream and technology advances, then more people will choose the former. What would make that choice even easier, however, is the feeling that your vehicle was really built for the long haul — that, unlike your phone, it isn’t simply one software update it can’t handle from becoming obsolete.</p><p>The alternative vision of EVs is out there. When I was first covering the <a href="https://makerfaire.com/" target="_blank"><u>Maker Faire</u></a> hacker festival a dozen years ago, there were already guys out there who’d teach you how to hack a first-generation Mazda into a <a href="https://ev-miata.com/" target="_blank"><u>dead-simple electric car</u></a>. (In the garage at Caltech, where I work, there’s someone who’s clearly done the same to a 1980s Porsche.) Like replacing 14 motors in an old Tesla, this is much more than the ordinary car owner wants to undertake. But it shows what is possible.</p><p>Tesla is apparently <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-q1-2024-earnings?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self"><u>back in</u></a> the race to make an affordable American EV, though it’s impossible to ever imagine the little Tesla being a dumbphone on wheels. Others, like Ford, are still trying. Perhaps with its EVs to come, the big Detroit brand can channel the spirit of the Ford Escort I drove in college: a plucky underdog that keeps on running, no matter how many people back into you in that icy parking lot.</p>

With the U.S. elections drawing nearer, careful attention should be paid to attempts by foreign actors to influence American voters. By accusing Burisma of sponsoring terrorist attacks in Russia and making loose insinuations that President Biden, the United States, and Western intelligence agencies are somehow connected as well, Russian disinformation campaigns are actively working to undermine and influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

## Snapdragon X Plus will bring ARM to ‘even more’ Windows laptops

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

While it’s still yet to debut, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite is looking like a big deal for ARM-powered Windows machines and, now, it’s getting a more affordable cousin in the Snapdragon X Plus. Announced today, Snapdragon X Plus is based on the same Oryon CPU as Snapdragon X Elite, just with a bit less power. The chip has 10 cores to the Elite’s 12, and is also clocked down from the Elite’s 3.8GHz to 3.4GHz. ↫ Ben Schoon at 9To5Google It really seems like it&#8217;s finally happening &#8211; ARM computers for the general public (that aren&#8217;t from Apple). I really hope that Qualcomm can deliver on its promises, and that Microsoft&#8217;s involvement means these computers will be fairly standardised so it&#8217;s easier for non-Windows platforms to support them. I&#8217;ve seen quite a few rumblings from people invited to Qualcomm&#8217;s press events for these new ARM chips that the company is delivering Linux support alongside Windows support, so that&#8217;s at least a good start. Whenever we talk about ARM coming to the generic PC market, people rightfully point out the lack of standardisation in the ARM space, so that really is the deciding factor here for people like us, who tend to not be all too interested in locked-down platforms. If every one of these machines is different enough that supporting them is a nightmare &#8211; like the world of smartphones &#8211; ARM for PCs will be dead on arrival for me because I have zero interest in buying Windows-only hardware. One thing Microsoft tends to be good at is getting at least some standardisation to stick in the PC market, and I hope they&#8217;re going to that here, too &#8211; Microsoft probably isn&#8217;t relishing supporting each individual ARM machine in Windows &#8216;by hand&#8217; either. Let&#8217;s keep our fingers crossed.

## Blinken looks to boost people-to-people ties during second visit to China

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

State Department  — While Washington and Beijing are divided over a range of thorny issues, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken began his second visit to China this week focusing first on the importance of direct engagement. It is something, he says, that is essential for addressing key issues affecting people from both countries and the world. 


People-to-people ties 


In a relaxed setting Wednesday, amid efforts to strengthen people-to-people ties, Blinken attended a playoff game between the Chinese Basketball Association's Shanghai Sharks and Zhejiang Golden Bulls. 




Earlier, a crowd of people gathered to watch as the motorcade of the U.S. delegation left its hotel for a local eatery, the Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant. There were more onlookers who gathered when Blinken sat at a table in the restaurant’s gallery, which overlooks a courtyard. 


Blinken said on social media that his “intensive face-to-face diplomacy” with officials from the People’s Republic of China is part of an “ongoing, direct engagement” that is “vital for making progress on issues that matter most to the American people and the world.” 




In Beijing, Chinese officials said Blinken's visit is part of the ongoing efforts of both nations to maintain dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation, and enhance coordination in international affairs.


Potential sanctions on Chinese banks


The United States has warned China against its support for Russia in its war on Ukraine, as Chinese firms directly supply crucial components to Russia's defense industry. This month, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven jointly called on China to cease transferring dual-use materials and weapons components aiding Russia's military production.


A senior State Department official told VOA that the United States is “prepared to take steps” when necessary against Chinese firms that “severely undermine security in both Ukraine and Europe.” But he declined to give any details about those potential further U.S. sanctions.  




What is clear is that the United States is considering sanctioning Chinese banks that facilitate the transfer of those materials.


U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said Washington stands ready to impose sanctions on Chinese banks and companies and Beijing's leadership if they assist Russia's military in its invasion of Ukraine. 


Officials in China have dismissed Washington’s concerns. 


“We firmly oppose the U.S.’s hypocritical moves of fanning the flames while deflecting the blame on China. China’s right to normal trade and economic cooperation with Russia and all other countries should not be violated. We will firmly safeguard our lawful rights and interests,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a briefing this week. 


Counternarcotics 


China-based companies remain the largest source of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that affects the United States. 


Immediately after U.S. President Joe Biden’s face-to-face talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Woodsides, California, in November, the Beijing government started to take action to curtail the flow of fentanyl precursors and equipment. 




For the first time in nearly three years, China submitted information related to 145 incidents to the International Narcotics Control Board’s global IONICS database, which supports global law enforcement coordination efforts to disrupt illicit synthetic drug supply chains, according to the State Department. 


While the initial Chinese actions were a positive step, Washington underscored the need for continued and sustained progress.


China can strengthen coordination with the U.S. and other international partners with law enforcement information sharing, regular contributions to international databases tracking synthetic drug threats, and monitoring emerging trends, said the U.S. State Department. 


Level 3: Reconsider travel to China 


Despite the increase of commercial flights between the United States and China, the U.S. government has advised Americans to reconsider travel to China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions. 


The State Department also advised Americans to exercise increased caution when traveling to Hong Kong and Macao due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.


A senior State Department official downplayed the possibility of immediately easing warnings by lowering the travel advisory from level 3 to level 2 for China.


“We’ll, of course, re-evaluate and, as appropriate, adjust. But really, this is a pretty rigorous process,” said the official during a recent briefing.


The senior official said Washington has raised concerns with Chinese counterparts regarding specific cases of detentions and exit bans, as well as the opaque and arbitrary application of certain national security laws.


To “ensure the safety and security of American citizens” traveling abroad is among the most important responsibilities of the U.S. government, said the official.


In Beijing, Chinese officials criticized the U.S. State Department's travel warning, calling it “unwarranted” and the “stumbling block” in people-to-people exchanges between the two countries. They urged the U.S. to revise the advisory level “as soon as possible.”

## Tesla misses the mark on all fronts in quarter of chaos

date: 2024-04-24, updated: 2024-04-24, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>Who cares that net profit slid 55%? Not Wall Street</h4> <p>In a dynamic first quarter, Elon Musk's Tesla contended with a terrorist organization, survived an arson attempt, and fiercely competed with hybrid car makers, all against a backdrop of falling prices as competition for electric vehicle customers intensified.…</p>

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
	1. Key takeaways from Tesla’s quarterly earnings report
</h3><p>
	Tesla reported first quarter earnings yesterday. The electric car company’s profits fell 55%, and revenue fell 9%. But shares rose more than 10% in after-hours trading following the shareholder update and earnings call. Here are a few things we learned from the report:
</p><ul>
<li>CEO Elon Musk said <strong>Tesla “should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,” </strong>and that “if you value Tesla as an auto company, that’s the wrong framework.”</li>
<li><strong>Plans for a sub-$30,000 EV</strong> haven’t been entirely scrapped, as previously reported. The company said it will “accelerate” the launch of new and more affordable models, but indicated “that any new, cheaper vehicle would not necessarily be entirely new nor unlock massive new savings through an all-new production process,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-863qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3lFM2yK_9TWk5rW3DcxDF9k5gFCW1Zt9LT5_H5B9W7hp-Vn7wyw21W8fL7Lx10dqwsVCWsnB4RtZ1TW1C8LqT8FkwDvW4MxQ-44Csc9mW8jDz2-4FR2rZW5qnj2_7kv4SgV4gskX63JJ1yVZ_vT21--prwN8Jcx2NVkrTjW1d-ZDg2N1b7fW4-bmTX8pW_ttW281MBb4yD9wnW4dC08p459pfmW5M49tP2z08VkW4_hbXy259WnkW34b7Dv4w18ZRW6lfJjz1v0SZwV9nMVl719KRZN41FcDdr9s33W6bKrFZ1fnf3fW2-TWL272VpthW4xrFf3395Vxtf8lJyVP04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin. The robotaxi, however, will rely on a new platform.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla’s energy business is growing</strong> faster than its car business. The company deployed just over 4 gigawatts of energy storage in the first quarter of the year, and its energy revenue was up 7% from a year ago. Profits from the business more than doubled.</li>
<li>Musk still wants to sell a “general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot,” and said <strong>the Optimus robot</strong> would be in “limited production” in a factory doing “useful tasks” by the end of this year.</li>
</ul><h3>
	2. Biden administration plans to hold up to a dozen offshore wind auctions by 2028

President Biden has a goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, but the industry has been blown off course thanks to inflation and disrupted supply chains. The Interior Department has held four offshore wind auctions so far during Biden’s presidency. The new schedule is an attempt to “jump-start the fledgling offshore wind sector” by expanding development potential, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-6Y5nXHsW5BWr2F6lZ3n3W8vhyWR42gGKXW2LJV116H1fhGN7rK7q25KFMtW5nKkPP1HD-qsN4DkxwdxkMMVW7RJLwD6j9kL2W39_NDH1PsLczW5b8t-M1ff1nzW837yZn8j2QCZW8ym4CY202fRdN4rYg2ZdBFzmW16Mkh26BTHQ5W7cGykJ4w3_72W37J8f31_8X_fVQVyGg7VB-xXW1DzVM72Kf33KW1bYXPs7f522DW1pFD-F6vknQbW5Gmg7q80kqnLW1fQ5l86QWtPSW3CQnbr7Xtw_cW1NZ2yf8MgTYbW2rjvmS6zVQQ2N1cGXs5KGNntW5vFDpr1VZJ_XW5rW-xh15y8CSW6M57PT80WRcKW5SsWxw3JdFJYW4Wg7rL2dt-mCW3wh8Kb31RNsTW8GQZ6z2R_kbCN7rzVGfR_lBxW7JJ8H-8M_Ns-W2-mJcw46NR-yf5L5jPx04" target="_blank">reported</a> <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. “Our offshore wind leasing schedule will provide predictability to help developers and communities plan ahead and will provide the confidence needed to continue building on the tremendous offshore wind supply chain and manufacturing investments that we've already seen,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.

<span></span>3. Poll: Few climate-concerned voters know about Biden’s climate policies
</h3><p>
	In the last month alone, $37 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act has gone toward climate projects. That amount “exceeds what the recent foreign aid bill will give to Israel, Taiwan, and humanitarian aid in Gaza, combined,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-863qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3pKW8_yc5556JDQgW3D689w7wcBpfVpLvnT8TlDwJW6XCQxX2vj4LhVYY-VV13h3__N7CFDF49n4_bW1zg7Gw7mB2rSW7SWLlZ7cQQZYW3zN1dC6MqTj4VBtc6H2nh0RgN6gPRY7rkmlDW4LYy7d1l1t-LW14x8tM7KS3x6W6BJBtL9j5St1W92f3m-6kqwbtN7DYlmT81nGwW6LXHfX4pt62qVLswND8dJ35-W6CdQr57xYVtVW917WpN9dVdBNW9g2LYl7fsSryW6fMJfp2x-z_ZW36_Tfh8h35SBN2KDZ-l5Vnb8W33J0_R4MKJ4cW15wZcL5y1BXwf3JDb2H04" target="_blank">reported Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. As the election approaches, the Biden administration is spending funds from the IRA much faster than it was last year. But it seems President Biden’s climate investments and emission-slashing initiatives aren’t getting through to Americans.

About 45% of respondents said climate change is a very important issue, but just 10% of those said they had heard or read “a lot” about Biden’s climate policies. And 42% said the administration hadn’t done enough on the issue.

The UN-led session is the second-to-last meeting before the treaty on reducing plastic pollution has to be finalized later this year, so the stakes are high, as are tensions between oil-producing nations and other countries that want to see plastic production dramatically reduced. The negotiations run through April 29.

## How I tricked iOS into giving me EU DMA features

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement where there&#8217;s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which Apple determines where an iPhone is from.

## How Jigar Shah Thinks About Risk

date: 2024-04-24, from: Heatmap News

	Jigar Shah might have more control over America’s new wave of industrial policy — not to mention its climate policy — than anyone not named Joe Biden. And he’s not even a Cabinet-level official. As director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is akin to its in-house bank, Shah oversees how roughly $400 billion in lending authority will be spent. That money will help finance new EV factories, geothermal wells, carbon capture sites, and more.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode, Rob sits down with Shah to discuss the philosophy that he brings to his role. When financing new projects — many of which are the first of their kind — how does he think about cash flow, about technological innovation, about risk? Robinson Meyer is executive editor of Heatmap News; Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineering professor at Princeton, is off this week.

</iframe></center><p>
Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>
	Robinson Meyer:</strong> I think one thing you’ve said often is that we have — and you alluded to at the beginning of the conversation — is that we haven’t built manufacturing in this country, basically, for 40 years. I think one note we’ve seen both from the president and from the partisan laws passed by Congress and the president — but also, frankly, from a more bipartisan set of lawmakers — is that there’s a lot of eagerness for that to change. So from your point of view as someone kind of in the weeds every day, what needs to change for the U.S. to build manufacturing and heavy industry domestically again?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jigar Shah: </strong>Well, let’s start by saying that I think that the BIL and IRA that’s passed has been a huge success story, right? We’ve gotten 500 announcements of new factories in the United States. And so, these are communities like the one that I grew up in, that had the seventh largest steel mill in the country that shut down while I was there. And all of the people who went to high school there expected to have a job there, and they don’t. Right? These are folks who are pretty pissed off about the fact that their lot in life, really, was destined to not have family-sustaining jobs for 40 years, right?<br/>
<br/>
And so now we’re giving people hope again that, for folks who have high school educations, that they can actually support their families and do these things, right? So in that perspective, we’re winning, right?
	<br/>
<br/>
But on the other side, we still have a lot more work to do, right? So when you think about the underlying conventional wisdom, the conventional wisdom is that you’re going to start a factory, China’s going to dump product in the United States and going to put you out of business, right? And so the local bank is saying, prove to me that China’s not going to dump product and put you out of business. Those old habits die hard, right?
	<br/>
<br/>
Now, the president has put together all sorts of belts and suspenders, but I don’t think that’s clear. I’ll give you an example. So in the EV supply chain — we have an extraordinary amount of lithium in this country. We made the announcements at Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge, as well as recycling for Li-Cycle and Redwood. But we’ve got additional abilities to get lithium over in Arkansas and Salton Sea in California.
	<br/>

And a lot of folks are saying, lithium prices are down 70% from their highs, right? So therefore there’s no way you can make it work right now. Lithium was $5,000 a unit in 2020. Today it’s $20,000 a unit. It was as high as $80,000 — $20,000 is still 4x what it was in 2020. And so there’s a way to make it profitable, but we also have the 30D program where a lot of automakers get incentives to buy locally for domestic content.

And so I feel like there’s just so much in the IRA, that the belts and suspenders approach that the administration took is not something that most people understand. And as a result, a lot of dollars are not moving from the commercial markets. We’ve got to step in and move them.

## OpenBSD as a daily driver

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews, and this time it&#8217;s even relevant to me as I&#8217;m exploring OpenBSD myself. OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system? There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that, a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS mode. ↫ Morgan I&#8217;ll be using this guide over the coming days to make sure I end up with something usable. I still haven&#8217;t decided on what desktop environment I want to go for &#8211; I&#8217;m not interested in running GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I&#8217;d also love to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0 was just released). There&#8217;s a small chance I might suck it up and use one of those &#8220;build your own desktop environment&#8221; options, but I have no idea which one I should go for.

## Re: Growth is a mind cancer

<p>Raghavan is a hall-of-fame rot economist, and one of the many managerial types that have caused immeasurable damage to the Internet in the name of growth and “shareholder value."

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest the popular short video app's U.S. assets within about nine months or face a

Ban.


The measure, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday, has been driven by concerns that China could access Americans' data or surveil them with the app and Biden has said he will sign it into law.


"For years we've allowed the Chinese Communist party to control one of the most popular apps in America that was dangerously shortsighted," said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee. "A new law is going to require its Chinese owner to sell the app. This is a good move for America."


TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the U.S. free speech rights of its users.


The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.


"We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday in an email seen by Reuters.


The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favor of the bill.

## 23 Apr 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h1>
<p><img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240>
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &quot;Godot is not what you are looking for&quot; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app (<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

## White House updates national suicide prevention strategy

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

washington — The White House on Tuesday unveiled an updated national strategy on suicide prevention that includes more emphasis on health equity and diversity and the mental-health impact of social media, revising its decade-old plan amid a national rise in suicide rates.


Second gentleman Doug Emhoff launched the new strategy at the White House, which he prefaced with words of comfort and encouragement.


"It's OK to talk about this, as tough as this topic is," he said. "So, that's why it's good that we're all here today together. It's important we do this, because as we all know, suicide affects everyone. Doesn't matter your age, race, gender or where you live. It impacts all of us."


The U.S. remains in a small clique of about 40 mostly high-income nations that have national plans to combat a menace that has left no society unscarred.


In a push for more countries to develop national strategies in 2018, the World Health Organization noted that "only a few countries in the low-income and middle-income categories have adopted a national suicide prevention strategy, even though 79% of suicides occur in these settings."


American health professionals told VOA a national plan is essential to tackling the problem. 


"The new national strategy focuses on a "whole of society" approach, which is unique —and critical — because no single entity alone can reduce suicide rates. But together, we have a real opportunity for impact," Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told VOA in an email.


Doctors who worked with the White House on the plan noted that not all its recommendations are strictly medical. Many are social and involve being more open about a matter that is often seen as taboo. 


"When it comes to a national strategy, you're actually looking to employ a multipronged approach," Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told VOA. "So, you would be looking to increase your mental health professional workforce that is culturally aligned with the population.


"But you'd also be looking to other things that low- and middle-income countries can do more readily, such as increasing interpersonal connectedness in schools and in workplaces — really these community-based approaches that have been found to be incredibly effective at reducing suicides. So, things like addressing loneliness, addressing interpersonal violence."


American actor Ashley Judd, who spoke at the White House on Tuesday, also stressed the importance of legitimizing mental illness. Her mother, musician Naomi Judd, committed suicide in 2022. 


"She won several Grammys, and she left country music better than she found it," Judd said of her mother, who was 76. "She also lived most of her life with an untreated and undiagnosed mental illness that lied to her and stole from her. And it stole from our family, and she deserved better."


Another issue the updated plan wrestled with is a uniquely American one. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 55% of American suicides are committed with firearms. 


"There is a very strong section on firearm suicide prevention in the national strategy," Moutier said, noting that the federal strategy mentions the important role of state-level red flag laws that would restrict firearms access for buyers who may harm themselves or others. 


The new strategy also emphasizes the value of "lived experience" — the validity of survivors' stories and those of their loved ones, who are scarred by the suicide. 


Musician Aloe Blacc spoke Tuesday of how he uses music to heal after the 2018 suicide of his close friend, Swedish electronica artist Tim Bergling – better known by his stage name, Avicii.




On the anniversary of his friend's death, Blacc recorded a version of his hit, "Wake Me Up."He also recorded a version he sang in Mandarin and Spanish. 


And on Tuesday, Blacc, sitting in the high-ceilinged, marble-walled room on the White House campus, burst into spontaneous song. His warm tenor filled the cavernous room as he sang a gospel standard, "This Little Light of Mine."


"Just remember," he said. "You are the light."


Blacc offered some simple advice to those who themselves may be struggling or know someone who is. 


"I want to encourage all of us here today and all of us watching to recognize the role that we can play, the positive role that we can play in someone else's life," he said. 


Or, as Wesolowski said, "The most important thing we can do is show up. ...The action of reaching out is more important than the words you say, and sometimes it can make all the difference."


The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention shared with VOA this list of international suicide hotlines.

## Common views and questions about metadata across Africa

date: 2024-04-24, from: Crossref Blog

<p>This past year has been a captivating journey of immersion within the Crossref community, a mix of online interactions and meaningful in-person experiences. From the engaging Sustainability Research and Innovation Conference in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to the impactful webinars conducted globally, this has been more than just a professional endeavour; it has been a personal exploration of collaboration, insights, and a shared commitment to pushing the boundaries of scholarly communication.</p>
<h2 id="working-collaboratively-with-research-funders-and-research-organisations">Working collaboratively with research funders and research organisations</h2>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/cocreation-activity-SRI.JPG"

<p>Cocreation activity in smaller groups at the SRI conference.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The adventure began with a significant in-person event, the Sustainability Research and Innovation Conference. In the coastal city of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, I had the honour of hosting a parallel co-creation session titled &ldquo;Connecting Science to Society: A Network Approach to Improving Science Communication in the Global South.&rdquo; The co-creation session addressed research discoverability and accessibility among early-career researchers. Apart from some immediate feedback from the researchers in the room about how they might use co-creation beyond the conference to improve their research experience and outcome, I also had conversations with research funders from the Belmont Forum, Future Earth, and National Research Foundation - South Africa and the National Research Foundation - Mozambique about connecting their grants and grantees with their published outputs referencing Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/" target="_blank">Open Funder Registry</a> and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/" target="_blank">research grants registration</a>. A different side conversation was about a community organisation in Botswana that is interested in registering patents with Crossref for proper referencing and protecting the intellectual property of their research on the indigenous communities’ innovations and the associated published work. These conversations are ongoing, unveiling a new understanding of unique needs and opportunities to pursue with research funders and research organisations working on indigenous knowledge and innovations.</p>
<h2 id="learning-from-organisations-in-gem-eligible-countries">Learning from organisations in GEM-eligible countries</h2>
<p>The journey extended globally through a series of webinars conducted in Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Collaborating with dedicated Ambassadors and my colleagues leading the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable Membership (GEM) program</a>, we witnessed an increase in Crossref membership from the GEM countries and initial metadata registration. The GEM Program offers relief from both Crossref membership and Crossref content registration fees for organisations in the least economically advantaged countries in the world, based on the World Bank&rsquo;s IDA list. Susan, in her blog post, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">The GEM Program: Year One</a>&rdquo;, elaborated on the significance of these efforts and their impact on fostering equitable access to scholarly resources and communication through the expansion of Crossref&rsquo;s membership base in underrepresented regions, such as Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Specific concerns encountered while presenting the GEM program included feedback expressing reservations about the program&rsquo;s approach, particularly in deciding on eligible countries, and advocating eligibility for the program to be extended to all the non-GEM countries in Africa. Additionally, a conversation with some organisations brought up concerns regarding the program&rsquo;s sustainability, with inquiries about whether GEM was merely a free trial or freemium service, and seeking assurances against future fees. The audience found these sessions helpful, acknowledging that joining fees were no longer going to be a barrier, yet questions about the program&rsquo;s longevity brought out the need for sustained support.</p>
<h2 id="discussing-how-the-research-nexus-can-support-the-community">Discussing how The Research Nexus can support the community</h2>
<p>My journey then led me to Makerere University in Uganda for the Consortium of Uganda University Libraries (CUUL 2023) conference and the Forum for Open Research in MENA (FORM 2023) in Abu Dhabi. In Uganda, I noticed the synergy between university libraries, institutional repositories, and the research and education network service provider formed a consortium that played a crucial role in bridging the digital gap and supporting the adoption of open infrastructure. The event was mainly attended by librarians from different universities in Uganda. Most of those I connected with needed more information about Crossref and had questions about how Crossref DOIs are different from ARKs, which they commonly use in their publishing workflows. At FORM 2023, in my presentation titled, &ldquo;The Research Nexus: A Rich and Reusable Open Network of Relationships in the Scholarly Record,&rdquo; I shared Crossref&rsquo;s vision for a connected research ecosystem with the audience that comprised of researchers, research administrators, and funders, and a good number of big publishers like IEEE and Taylor &amp; Francis. The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">Research Nexus</a> seeks to reveal relationships beyond persistent identifiers, utilising rich metadata to connect various scholarly components. I also took the opportunity at both events to share about <a href="https://theplace.discourse.group/" target="_blank">The Publishers Learning And Community Exchange (PLACE)</a>, an online forum promoting best practices in scholarly publishing. The goal was to show attendees how they can actively contribute to and benefit from this vision, fostering a robust and interconnected research community through Crossref&rsquo;s open infrastructure.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the opportunity to join the National Open Science Dialogue by TCC Africa, which provided crucial insights, emphasising the need for assessing awareness, implementing comprehensive policies, and fostering collaboration around Open Science. Higher education institutions were recognized as influencers in the global Open Science movement, while a call for an inclusive research environment was underscored through open access and data sharing. The dialogue emphasized a collective effort involving policymakers, educators, researchers, and institutions, focusing on inclusivity and collaboration to advance Open Science in East Africa.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the Crossref Nairobi event that happened in February 2024, it was an enriching experience exploring key issues shaping scholarly publishing in Kenya. The discussions also touched on the role of metadata as a trust signal and a tool for the persistence of the scholarly record, particularly in regions where data protection challenges persist. This is exemplified by concerns raised during the event about the fear of data theft, misuse, or loss, especially in places with comparatively weaker data protection laws. The presence of robust metadata, particularly with detailed provenance information, becomes crucial in such contexts, as it enables better identification and handling of potential misuse. Thus, through effective metadata implementation and the persistence facilitated by identifiers, the management of data risks can be significantly improved.</p>
<p>The insights from existing Crossref members pointed out contextual challenges, regional differences, and the importance of effective post-publication processes. The conference served as a valuable platform for dialogue, emphasising the collective commitment to continuous improvement of scholarly communication in the country, and the need for continuous awareness and training on making the most of Crossref services. The roundtable discussions during the Crossmark service consultation brought to light various reflections and considerations regarding post-publication changes in publishing workflows. The Crossmark service was a new discovery for most participants, with potential value recognized in facilitating current updates on articles. However, there are existing barriers such as a lack of awareness and technical expertise, suggesting the need for further education to facilitate adoption. Overall, the consultation provided a platform for introspection and exploration of avenues for improving post-publication practices in scholarly publishing.</p>

<p>We organised the Crossref Nairobi event with the help of colleagues from the outreach team and local Ambassadors, Mercury Shitindo of Kenya, Baraka Ngussa of Tanzania and our Board Members in Kenya, Oscar Donde. It was the first time I saw both my colleagues and Ambassadors in action and working closely together - making presentations and accommodating last-minute facilitation changes to the program. Compared to attending or speaking at an event, organising one was a unique experience requiring a lot of planning in advance for logistics and the event program, identifying and keeping in touch with important stakeholders, ushering guests and being on standby for any matters that come up about the event. All of that went very well thanks to the team on the ground and cooperative participants.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-role-of-open-infrastructure-for-african-universities">Exploring the role of open infrastructure for African universities</h2>
<p>Attending the recent WACREN 2024 conference was an eye-opening experience, unfolding the role of open infrastructure in addressing challenges faced by African universities. A focus on open access systems and advocacy for decolonizing knowledge were voiced too, including challenges of affordability of DOIs and questions of local ownership amidst global initiatives. Global persistent identifier providers, including ORCID and DataCite too, had a presence at the conference, alongside passionate advocates for more locally managed, decentralised infrastructure. These are concerns that Crossref needs to understand better, as we seek to find effective ways of supporting equitable participation in the Research Nexus. The conference resonated with a call for continued work in fostering accessibility, sharing, and leveraging resources to accelerate research and innovation in Africa.</p>

<p>Conversations with Crossref Ambassadors brought about a shared narrative across universities in some African countries. These institutions are actively embracing digital shifts, setting up institutional repositories using platforms like DSpace and OJS. However, challenges persist, particularly in funding and technical capacity. It&rsquo;s heartening to see how national and regional research and education networks step in to help in internet connectivity, opening up collaboration opportunities with other interoperable infrastructure, setting up repositories, providing hosting services and event managing content identifiers.</p>
<p>Deceptive publishing practices remain a shared concern, and we’ve had requests at these meetings for stricter inclusion criteria for membership of Crossref to ensure quality and trustworthiness of articles accessible through Crossref metadata.</p>
<p>We’ve explained to those we’ve met that Crossref doesn’t (and can’t) assess the quality of content or the integrity of the research process. We don’t have the people or the skills, and it isn’t our mission to be the gatekeepers of research quality. A DOI record is just an indication that something was published, it isn’t an indication of quality.</p>
<p>However, we do still have a vital role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record. We provide the infrastructure which enables those who produce scholarly outputs to provide metadata (effectively evidence) about how they ensure the quality of content and how the outputs fit into the scholarly record. The scholarly record - that network of published outputs, inputs, relationships and contexts - is captured through the metadata records that our members register with us, and that we then distribute freely and openly through our API. The richer and more comprehensive Crossref records are, the more context there is for our members and for the whole scholarly research ecosystem to make their own decisions around trustworthiness. Blocking access to the infrastructure creates gaps in the scholarly record, but also potentially blocks legitimate newcomers.</p>
<p>“Crossref is focused on enriching metadata to provide more and better trust signals while keeping barriers to membership and participation as low as possible to enable an inclusive scholarly record.”

<p>While the landscape of digital scholarly publication witnesses significant strides, a crucial need persists, the importance of preserving and interconnecting metadata to the global scholarly record. It&rsquo;s not just about discoverability, a theme resonating strongly within the community, but about enabling reproducibility, upholding research and editorial integrity, and facilitating reporting and assessment.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward">The path forward</h2>
<p>As I reflect on this year of immersing myself within the Crossref community, building awareness in new communities, and learning more about the different perceptions across the region, it feels like a personal progression of growth and discovery. From the captivating in-person moments to the global webinars and collaborative efforts to address challenges in scholarly communication, this journey is not just a professional pursuit; it&rsquo;s a personal exploration. The path forward involves continued support, intensified awareness-building, and sustained dialogue, ensuring that the scholarly ecosystem continues to thrive, evolve, and leave a lasting impact.</p>
