I spent some time corresponding with the IBM archives but they can’t

<h2 id="openai-reasoning-models-advice-on-prompting">OpenAI reasoning
models: Advice on prompting</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#advice-on-prompting">OpenAI
reasoning models: Advice on prompting</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI’s documentation for their o1 and o3 “reasoning models” includes
some interesting tips on how to best prompt them:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Developer messages are the new system messages:</strong>
Starting with <code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models support
<code>developer</code> messages rather than <code>system</code>
messages, to align with the
<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#follow-the-chain-of-command">chain
of command behavior described in the model spec</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This appears to be a purely aesthetic change made for consistency with
their
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/23/the-instruction-hierarchy/">instruction
hierarchy</a> concept. As far as I can tell the old <code>system</code>
prompts continue to work exactly as before - you’re encouraged to use
the new <code>developer</code> message type but it has no impact on what
actually happens.
</p>
<p>
Since my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool already bakes
in a <code>llm –system “system prompt”</code> option which works across
multiple different models from different providers I’m not going to rush
to adopt this new language!
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Use delimiters for clarity:</strong> Use delimiters like
markdown, XML tags, and section titles to clearly indicate distinct
parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections
appropriately.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anthropic have been encouraging
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags">XML-ish
delimiters</a> for a while (I say -ish because there’s no requirement
that the resulting prompt is valid XML). My
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>
tool has a <code>-c</code> option which outputs Claude-style XML, and in
my experiments this same option works great with o1 and o3 too:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> limbo/bindings/python

files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m o3-mini \
  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG):</strong> When providing additional context or documents, include
only the most relevant information to prevent the model from
overcomplicating its response.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This makes me thing that o1/o3 are not good models to implement RAG on
at all - with RAG I like to be able to dump as much extra context into
the prompt as possible and leave it to the models to figure out what’s
relevant.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Try zero shot first, then few shot if needed:</strong> Reasoning
models often don’t need few-shot examples to produce good results, so
try to write prompts without examples first. If you have more complex
requirements for your desired output, it may help to include a few
examples of inputs and desired outputs in your prompt. Just ensure that
the examples align very closely with your prompt instructions, as
discrepancies between the two may produce poor results.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Providing examples remains the single most powerful prompting tip I
know, so it’s interesting to see advice here to only switch to examples
if zero-shot doesn’t work out.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Be very specific about your end goal:</strong> In your
instructions, try to give very specific parameters for a successful
response, and encourage the model to keep reasoning and iterating until
it matches your success criteria.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This makes sense: reasoning models “think” until they reach a
conclusion, so making the goal as unambiguous as possible leads to
better results.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Markdown formatting:</strong> Starting with
<code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models in the API will avoid
generating responses with markdown formatting. To signal to the model
when you <strong>do</strong> want markdown formatting in the response,
include the string <code>Formatting re-enabled</code> on the first line
of your <code>developer</code> message.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This one was a <em>real shock</em> to me! I noticed that o3-mini was
outputting <code>•</code> characters instead of Markdown <code>*</code>
bullets and initially thought
<a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1886121477822648441">that was
a bug</a>.
</p>
<p>
I first saw this while running this prompt against
<a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/tree/main/bindings/python">limbo/bindings/python</a>
using
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">

  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Here’s the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8283d68e9bd7ad3f140d52cad6874a7">full
result</a>, which includes text like this (note the weird bullets):
</p>
<pre><code>Features
--------
• High‑performance, in‑process database engine written in Rust  
• SQLite‑compatible SQL interface  
• Standard Python DB‑API 2.0–style connection and cursor objects
</code></pre>
<p>
I ran it again with this modified prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Formatting re-enabled. Write a detailed README with extensive
usage examples.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this time got back
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">proper
Markdown, rendered in this Gist</a>. That did a really good job, and
included bulleted lists using this valid Markdown syntax instead:

<p>I'm 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his
software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the
government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your
passport. And if you try to arrest him, he'll stop paying interest on
the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve
currency. He won't just control the US government, he will control the
world economy</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/1/the-problem-with-better-models">
<p>
Part of the concept of ‘Disruption’ is that important new technologies
tend to be bad at the things that matter to the previous generation of
technology, but they do something else important instead. Asking if an
LLM can do very specific and precise information retrieval might be like
asking if an Apple II can match the uptime of a mainframe, or asking if
you can build Photoshop inside Netscape. No, they can’t really do that,
but that’s not the point and doesn’t mean they’re useless. They do
something else, and that ‘something else’ matters more and pulls in all
of the investment, innovation and company creation. Maybe, 20 years
later, they can do the old thing too - maybe you can run a bank on PCs
and build graphics software in a browser, eventually - but that’s not
what matters at the beginning. They unlock something else.
</p>
<p>
What is that ‘something else’ for generative AI, though? How do you
think conceptually about places where that error rate is a feature, not
a bug?

Yes, we are discussing. I personally think we have been on the wrong
side of history here and need to figure out a different open source
strategy; not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it’s also not our
current highest priority.

<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a></strong>
</p>
I’ve renamed my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin
to <code>llm-anthropic</code>, on the basis that Claude 4 will probably
happen at some point so this is a better name for the plugin.
</p>
<p>
If you’re a previous user of <code>llm-claude-3</code> you can upgrade
to the new plugin like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-claude-3
</code></pre>
<p>
This should remove the old plugin and install the new one, because the
latest <code>llm-claude-3</code> depends on <code>llm-anthropic</code>.
Just installing <code>llm-anthropic</code> may leave you with both
plugins installed at once.
</p>
<p>
There is one extra manual step you’ll need to take during this upgrade:
creating a new <code>anthropic</code> stored key with the same API token
you previously stored under <code>claude</code>. You can do that like
so:
</p>
<pre><code>llm keys set anthropic --value "$(llm keys get claude)"
</code></pre>
<p>
I released
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.12">llm-anthropic
0.12</a> yesterday with new features not previously included in
<code>llm-claude-3</code>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Support for Claude’s
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response">prefill</a>
feature, using the new <code>-o prefill ‘{’</code> option and the
accompanying <code>-o hide_prefill 1</code> option to prevent the
prefill from being included in the output text.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/2">#2</a>
</li>
<li>
New <code>-o stop_sequences ‘```’</code> option for specifying one or
more stop sequences. To specify multiple stop sequences pass a JSON
array of strings :<code>-o stop_sequences ’[“end”, “stop”]</code>.
</li>
<li>
Model options are now documented in the README.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you install or upgrade <code>llm-claude-3</code> you will now get
<code>llm-anthropic</code> instead, thanks to a tiny package on PyPI
which depends on the new plugin name. I created that with my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename</a>
cookiecutter template.
</p>
<p>
<p>Here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3/issues/31">issue for the
rename</a>. I archived the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3 repository
on GitHub</a>, and got to use the brand new
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/pypi-now-supports-project-archival/">PyPI
archiving feature</a> to archive the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm-claude-3/">llm-claude-3 project on
PyPI</a> as well.</p>

professional workflow for translation using LLMs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">A
professional workflow for translation using LLMs</a></strong>
</p>
Tom Gally is a <a href="https://gally.net/translation.html">professional
translator</a> who has been exploring the use of LLMs since the release
of GPT-4. In this Hacker News comment he shares a detailed workflow for
how he uses them to assist in that process.
</p>
<p>
Tom starts with the source text and custom instructions, including
context for how the translation will be used.
<a href="https://www.gally.net/temp/20250201sampletranslationprompt.html">Here’s
an imaginary example prompt</a>, which starts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>The text below in Japanese is a product launch presentation for
Sony’s new gaming console, to be delivered by the CEO at Tokyo Game Show
2025. Please translate it into English. Your translation will be used in
the official press kit and live interpretation feed. When translating
this presentation, please follow these guidelines to create an accurate
and engaging English version that preserves both the meaning and energy
of the original: […]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It then lists some tone, style and content guidelines custom to that
text.
</p>
<p>
Tom runs that prompt through several different LLMs and starts by
picking sentences and paragraphs from those that form a good basis for
the translation.
</p>
<p>
As he works on the full translation he uses Claude to help brainstorm
alternatives for tricky sentences:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When I am unable to think of a good English version for a particular
sentence, I give the Japanese and English versions of the paragraph it
is contained in to an LLM (usually, these days, Claude) and ask for ten
suggestions for translations of the problematic sentence. Usually one or
two of the suggestions work fine; if not, I ask for ten more. (Using an
LLM as a sentence-level thesaurus on steroids is particularly
wonderful.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He uses another LLM and prompt to check his translation against the
original and provide further suggestions, which he occasionally acts on.
Then as a final step he runs the finished document through a
text-to-speech engine to try and catch any “minor awkwardnesses” in the
result.
</p>
<p>
<p>I <em>love</em> this as an example of an expert using LLMs as tools
to help further elevate their work. I’d love to read more examples
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">like this
one</a> from experts in other fields.</p>

conversation on feature flags</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899778#42900221">Hacker
News conversation on feature flags</a></strong>
</p>
I posted the following comment in a thread on Hacker News about feature
flags, in response to this article
<a href="https://code.mendhak.com/hardcode-feature-flags/">It’s OK to
hardcode feature flags</a>. This kicked off a <em>very</em> high quality
conversation on build-vs-buy and running feature flags at scale
involving a bunch of very experienced and knowledgeable people. I
recommend reading the comments.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The single biggest value add of feature flags is that they de-risk
deployment. They make it less frightening and difficult to turn features
on and off, which means you’ll do it more often. This means you can
build more confidently and learn faster from what you build. That’s
worth a lot.
</p>
<p>
I think there’s a reasonable middle ground-point between having feature
flags in a JSON file that you have to redeploy to change and using an
(often expensive) feature flags as a service platform: roll your own
simple system.
</p>
<p>
A relational database lookup against primary keys in a table with a
dozen records is effectively free. Heck, load the entire collection at
the start of each request - through a short lived cache if your
profiling says that would help.
</p>
<p>
Once you start getting more complicated (flags enabled for specific
users etc) you should consider build-vs-buy more seriously, but for the
most basic version you really can have no-deploy-changes at minimal cost
with minimal effort.
</p>
<p>
There are probably good open source libraries you can use here too,
though I haven’t gone looking for any in the last five years.
