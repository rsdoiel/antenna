id="carbon-offsets-from-clean-cookstoves-are-kind-of-bogus-too">Carbon
Offsets From Clean Cookstoves Are Kind of Bogus, Too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE1MDU3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTE2MDIwNX0.F9AK6uxlARgIimw_uwDbdw1F2fHsW6R2gxbQIl_S82o/image.jpg?width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C125"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A new study casts doubt on the integrity of yet another type of carbon
offset.
</p>
<p>
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, investigated
clean cookstove projects, in which companies distribute stoves that
require less or cleaner types of fuel to people who cannot afford them
and sell carbon credits based on the resulting emission reductions.
These projects have generated, on average, nine times more carbon
credits than they should have based on their climate benefits, the
researchers found.
</p>
<p>
This kind of credit inflation obscures climate progress, as the
individuals and businesses who buy these credits do so to justify their
own emissions under the belief that they are funding climate action
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
It also threatens a key source of funding to remedy a major public
health problem. Nearly a third of the global population — some 2.3
billion people — cook with wood and charcoal burned on open fires or in
very basic stoves that expose people to dangerous levels of pollution,
including particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The smoke contributes
to respiratory and cardiovascular problems and leads to an estimated 4
million premature deaths every year. On top of that, this form of
cooking releases roughly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
Companies have jumped at the opportunity to finance solutions by selling
carbon offsets, with great success. Between 2017 and 2022, the volume of
finance secured for clean cookstoves through the carbon market increased
45-fold, according to a
<a href="https://cleancooking.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CCA_A-Call-to-Action_Delivering-Responsible-Carbon-Finance.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report
by the Clean Cookstove Alliance</a> published last fall. Now, cookstove
projects make up some 10% of all credits on the carbon market. And
they’re one of the fastest growing types of offset projects.
</p>
<p>
The new
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01259-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>,
published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Nature Sustainability</em> on
Wednesday, finds that the methods developers are using to measure the
amount of carbon these projects avoid are deeply flawed.
</p>
<p>
The first red flag the researchers identified was that academic studies
of clean cookstoves report much lower adoption rates (whether the new
stove was used) and usage rates (how often the new stove was used) than
offset projects do. A representative sample of offset projects reported
an 86% adoption rate and 98% usage rate, whereas the research literature
reported a 58% adoption rate and 52% usage rate.
</p>
<p>
“The literature at large has found, honestly, devastatingly low rates of
adoption and usage,” Annalise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at Berkeley and
the lead author of the study told me. Some families totally abandon
their new stoves, while others continue to use traditional cooking
methods in addition to the clean stove. That’s because the new stoves
might have smaller burners, not get as hot, change the taste of
traditional foods, or else just create more work for cooks. “The first
thing you have to ask yourself is, have these offset projects just
solved it?” Gill-Wiehl said. “Or are there limitations in their
methods?”
</p>
<p>
One big limitation, according to Gill-Wiehl and her coauthors, is the
way offset data is collected. To measure adoption, many project managers
use a simple one-time survey that asks households if they used the new
stove in the last week or month. If they reply yes, the developer will
generate credits as if the household used the stove 100% of the time.
Not only is this not exactly robust methodologically, but it may also
result in participants inflating their usage to please the survey
collectors — a common effect known as “social desirability bias.”
</p>
<p>
Another major issue stems from the way these projects account for larger
environmental impacts. One of the key ways clean cookstove initiatives
cut emissions is by reducing the degradation of forests that results
from the gathering of fuel to make fires. It would be impossible to
measure these cuts directly, but the default estimates that project
developers use vastly overstate the level of degradation that would
otherwise occur compared to what the peer-reviewed literature has found.
</p>
<p>
But like anything offsets-related, this study, too, has attracted fierce
scrutiny. After an earlier version of it was published a year ago,
offset project developers
<a href="https://cquestcapital.com/latest/news-and-blogs/open-letter-experts-challenge-misguided-criticism-of-clean-cookstoves-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a>
with an open letter calling it “misguided.” For instance, the letter
calls it inappropriate to compare carbon offset projects to
non-commercial projects analyzed in the academic literature. It also
accuses the Berkeley researchers of selectively choosing studies and
carbon offset projects to include. Finally, the letter also points to
the fact that the Better Cooking Company, a cookstove company that is
trying to sell credits, provided funding for the study and asserts that
the findings benefit that company.
</p>
<p>
Gill-Wiehl pushed back on all points. The Better Cookstove Company
provided 10% of the funding, she said, and had no influence over the
findings. She added that the results don’t benefit the company — the
study implies that it, too, is guilty of over-crediting, primarily due
to inflated forest conservation estimates.
</p>
<p>
“We did not write this to burn cookstoves to the ground,” she told me.
“This is an incredibly important project type, and it’s so incredibly
important that it can’t be based on a house of cards.”
</p>
<p>
Gill-Wiehl said she and her co-authors want the carbon market registries
— the groups that design the methodologies project developers must
follow to generate and sell credits — to adopt stronger rules that
improve the integrity of the market. For example, to measure usage, they
could require developers to collect metered data from the stoves or to
use fuel sales data. They also want the registries to require that
developers use more accurate estimates from the literature for forest
degradation. Without significant change, buyers could lose confidence
and funding could dry up.
</p>
<p>
Some of the issues with clean cookstove projects were already known, if
not quantified to the extent in this new paper, and there are some
ongoing efforts in the industry to improve them. An influential United
Nations body
<a href="https://cleancooking.org/news/unfccc-posts-fnrb-update-research-for-public-comment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently
supported research</a> to establish more accurate estimates of forest
degradation, and a
<a href="https://cleancooking.org/cca-led-clean-cooking-climate-consortium-makes-significant-progress-in-developing-clean-cooking-carbon-methodology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consortium
of government groups and NGOs</a> is working to develop stronger rules
for crediting cookstove projects.
</p>
<p>
The authors of the study hope this increased attention on cookstoves
doesn’t just lead to more legitimate offset projects, but also to ones
that better prioritize public health. The vast majority of the
cookstoves handed out for offset projects are designed to run more
efficiently, but still expose users to dangerous levels of pollution. As
of November 2022, only 4% of projects provided the types of stoves that
the
<a href="https://www.who.int/tools/clean-household-energy-solutions-toolkit/module-7-defining-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World
Health Organization deems</a> “clean for health at point of use.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel like at this moment when there’s a shake up of the offset market
in general — but also, right now around cookstoves — we have an
opportunity to direct all of this finance to projects that have a
transformative benefit to people’s lives and health,” Barbara Haya,
director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project and one of the study’s
authors, told me. “And we have an obligation to do that if we’re going
to use those credits to make claims of reducing emissions.”

Defense Secretary Makes First Public Appearance, Virtually, Since
Hospitalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday made his
first public appearance, virtually and from home, since his secret
hospitalization, during a meeting on Ukraine’s military needs. </p>
<p>He skipped over prepared remarks that would have addressed his
health.  </p>
<p>Austin, 70, was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center in Maryland on December 22 to treat prostate cancer. He returned
to the hospital on January 1 due to complications, including a urinary
tract infection. His hospitalization was not revealed until four days
later, and the Pentagon did not specify why he was being treated until
January 9. </p>
<p>Austin’s failure to tell President Joe Biden he was hospitalized drew
criticism from lawmakers and caught the White House by surprise. </p>
<p>Austin appeared on the livestream for a few minutes as he made his
opening remarks. He was sitting in front of a white wall with what
appeared to be a security system keypad on his left and a Department of
Defense seal on the right, with small U.S. and Ukrainian flags on top of
a printer next to it.  </p>
<p>While there was a slight break in the livestream, Austin did not
address his health, even though the topic was in his prepared
remarks. </p>
<p>He is not expected to take part in a joint press conference with the
top U.S. general after the meeting, something that has become routine
after such gatherings.</p>

Brain Region That Controls Movement Also Guides Feelings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
The cerebellum is responsible for far more than coordinating movement.
New techniques reveal that it is, in fact, a hub of sensory and
emotional processing in the brain.

<h2 id="when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">When did Raspberry Pi

<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">When
did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gmktec-n100-pc-raspberry-pi-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi 5 and N100 GMKtec Nucbox G3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I just bought this N100-based Intel x86 mini PC (<em>brand new</em>),
and it was cheaper than an almost equivalent—but slower—Raspberry Pi 5.
</p>
<p>
This GMKtec mini PC is called the
<a href="https://amzn.to/4b88MVp">Nucbox G3</a>, and it comes with an
Intel Alder Lake N100 4-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and
Windows 11 Pro—and mine cost just $131, after a couple coupons.
</p>
<p>
That’s… a lot of computer for a very good price. But the Raspberry
Pi—the famous “$35 computer”, should be well below that… right?
</p>
<p>
Well, I bought all the parts required to build a Pi 5 to the same
spec—including the adapters and parts to assemble it into one small
unit—and it turns out… the Pi is <em>more expensive</em>. And
<em>slower</em>.
</p>
<p>
The Pi 4 still starts at $35 (for a 1 GB model), but the Pi 5 starts at
$60 (for 4 GB) and climbs to $80 for the maximum 8 GB model.

<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-advanced-squad-leader">How to get

<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader
</h1>
<p>
The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you
even get started?
</p>
<p>
There are four
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a>
(SK):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regular infantry
</li>
<li>
Guns
</li>
<li>
Tanks
</li>
<li>
Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn’t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this
is not how it works. Start small.
</p>
<p>
You can get the
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules
for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Buy
<a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the
complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.
</p>
<p>
As somebody recently told me: “Looking up the rules is 90% of the game!”
</p>
<p>
I like to call Advanced Squad Leader “the game to end all
rules-lawyering.”
</p>
<p>
For online gaming, you need to download the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine
for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card
games. Vassal is free, open-source software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to
run ASL on VASSAL.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VASL site has a section called “Download Scenarios” where you can
download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you
load those games, you’ll see messages about all the extensions you’re
missing. Often you don’t need them, but feel free to install them.
</p>
<p>
If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be
aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff
that gets used in later boxes.

in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I
was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living

<a href="https://archive.org/details/macworld-magazine">MacWorld</a>. We
were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our
“idea processor” ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a
couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be
an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people
at Apple who believed in us, notably

without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn’t have to find out. Thank
you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for
creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when
we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that
idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software
developers.</p>

spent. Vice President Kamala Harris has been telling crowds that she and
Biden have invested $1 trillion in climate initiatives. The figure
“doesn’t align with one of the chief metrics observers have used to
measure the administration’s climate agenda: $369 billion,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2cc8d4224&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
<em>E&amp;E News</em>. So where did it come from? Simple arithmetic, the
White House said. “She is referencing all of the clean energy,
resilience, environmental justice, and innovation funding that is part
of our historic effort to address the climate crisis, increase
resilience, advance environmental justice, and build a clean energy
economy,” a White House spokesperson told <em>E&amp;E News</em>. While
right-wing critics say the spending has been excessive, the
administration is hoping it will show climate-oriented voters that Biden
cares, and motivate them to vote.

<li>Report: Benefits of storing carbon in soil ‘too good to be

</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The carbon sequestration benefits of regenerative
farming have been overexaggerated, reports
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=80c93428e8&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">the<em>
Financial Times</em></a>, as agribusiness giants look for new ways to
offset their emissions. Regenerative agriculture aims to improve soil
quality by avoiding pesticides and fertilizers, planting cover crops,
and leaving fields untilled. Healthier soil can store more carbon, which
is why big polluters in food production are committing money and land to
regenerative practices. But the soil sequestration movement is
undermined by murky measurements and a lack of clear guidelines and
definitions from the agrifood industry: Just 18 of the 50 projects using
regenerative agriculture offered quantitative targets, the <em>FT</em>
reported. Industries seem to be ignoring the fact that soil can only
hold so much carbon before emissions rise again, and that carbon stored
in soil isn’t trapped forever.

the Arctic’s landmass is located in Russia, and after the invasion of
Ukraine, Moscow stopped sharing data from its Arctic monitoring
stations. “This has potentially global consequences for important
processes such as permafrost thawing, shifts in biodiversity, or even
greenhouse gas emissions,”

than the rest of the planet, and monitoring what happens in the region

Dave Maass and Patrick Ley’s “Death Strikes: The Emperor of Atlantis”
(23 January 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Dave Maass and Patrick Ley’s “Death Strikes: The
Emperor of Atlantis”: A graphic novel based on a musical written by
inmates at a Nazi death-camp. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate.
This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Dave Maass and Patrick Ley’s “Death Strikes: The Emperor
of Atlantis” (permalink) “The Emperor of Atlantis,” is an opera written
by two Nazi concentration camp inmates, the librettist Peter Kien and
the composer Viktor Ullmann, while they were interned in Terezin, a
show-camp in Czechoslovakia that housed numerous Jewish artists, who
were encouraged to make and display their work as a way of proving to
the rest of the world that Nazi camps were humane places. Of course, it
was all a sham. Like nearly all of Terezin’s inmates, Kein and Ullmann
were eventually shipped to Auschwitz to be murdered. “The Emperor” was
never performed during their life, but the manuscript, written on
scrounged paper (including the backs of other inmates Auschwitz transfer
papers) survived. In the decades since, “The Emperor” has been mounted a
few times, with varying degrees of faithfulness. But those live
performances were limited to the people who could attend them during
their limited run. Now, a new graphic novel called Death Strikes: The
Emperor of Atlantis, brings the work to us all:
https://www.darkhorse.com/Blog/3726/berger-books-and-dark-horse-comics-present-death-s
Death Strikes was adapted by my EFF colleague Dave Maass, an
investigator and muckraker and brilliant writer, who teamed up with
illustrator Patrick Lay and character designer Ezra Rose (who worked
from the Kein and Ullmann’s original designs, which survived along with
the score and libretto). The tale is set in the mythical kingdom of
Atlantis, where the reclusive emperor has been holed up in an armored
tower for decades, directing a forever war, greeting each battlefield
report with fresh orders, all the while carefully scheming to maintain
his grip on power by prolonging the war footing among his people. But
the Emperor has a problem: he’s won the war. Every enemy has fallen.
Without endless war, his system of social control will shrivel and he
will be vulnerable to his people. So the Emperor declares a new war of
all against all, announcing that it is every citizen’s duty to make war
on their neighbors. Problem solved! But the Emperor goes too far. In
announcing his new war, he directs his messengers – drum-beating
automata who march through the streets of Atlantic rapping out his
edicts – to claim that Death himself has blessed this new war, and “when
the final drum sounds, our old friend DEATH, our flag-bearer, will raise
his sword in salute to our great future!” For Death – a swordbearing
skeleton in a soldier’s greatcoat and shako – this is too much. The
Emperor’s endless wars have already tried Death’s patience. Death brings
mercy, not vengeance, and the endless killing has dismayed him. The
Emperor’s co-option drives him past the brink, and Death declares a
strike, breaking his sword and announcing that henceforth, no one will
die. Needless to say, this puts a crimp in the Emperor’s all-out war
plan. People get shot and stabbed and drowned and poisoned, but they
don’t die. They just hang around, embarrassingly alive (there’s a great
comic subplot of the inability of the Emperor’s executioners to kill a
captured assassin). The Emperor will not be denied. He embarks upon a
war of wills with Death, to see who will give in first. The surreal tale
plays out among the people of Atlantis, the living and the undead, as
they struggle to fight a war where no one can die. The tale cuts between
these people, the Emperor, and Death, who is in company with Life, a sad
harlequin who is even more demoralized than Death by the Emperor’s long
war. What follows is a tale of revolution and love and hope snatched
from despair. Maass discovered “The Emperor” through a bargain bin CD of
“degenerate music” he found in a suburban Best Buy in the 1990s, which
was accompanied by illustrations by Art Spiegelman:
https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-music-survives%21-degenerate-music-music-suppressed-by-the-third-reich-mw0000711660
Maass found a six-panel cartoon Kein drew “expressing his frustration
with the evolution of his libretto.” Over the years, Maass turned this
little strip over and over in his head, until he found himself
travelling to Prague with Ley, where they were able to handle the
surviving manuscript pages. After consulting with experts all over the
world, Maass and Ley and their collaborators created this extraordinary
graphic novel, updating it, queering it, and lavishly illustrating it.
While this is clearly an adaptation, Kein and Ullmann’s spirit of
creativity, courage, and bittersweet creative foment shines through.
It’s a beautiful book, snatched from death itself. Hey look at this

Expresses US Commitment to Boosting Africa Partnerships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said
Tuesday the United States is committed to growing its partnerships
across the African continent and increasingly sees African countries
“leading on issues of global consequence.”</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters alongside Ivory Coast President Alassane
Ouattara after talks in Abidjan, Blinken said the discussion included
growing commercial ties to create jobs and growth in both the U.S. and
Ivory Coast, as well as investing in public health initiatives and
addressing regional security challenges.</p>
<p>Blinken said the United States and Ivory Coast “have a strong and
growing bond.”</p>
<p>Blinken’s visit to Ivory Coast is seen as reflecting U.S. interests
in the country’s stability and its preparations for the 2025
presidential election.</p>
<p>The U.S. and international community are concerned about stability in
the Sahel sub-region of West Africa following several coups in Mali,
Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger since 2020.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in
recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in both August 2020 and May
2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September of 2022.</p>
<p>The United States announced $45 million in new funding to aid Ivory
Coast and its neighbors in preventing conflict and promoting stability
amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S.
stability-focused assistance in Coastal West Africa to nearly $300
million since 2022.</p>
<p>From Ivory Coast, Blinken is traveling Tuesday to Nigeria where he is
set to hold talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and Foreign
Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar in Abuja.</p>
<p>Regional security talks in Nigeria</p>
<p>Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its
elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, on July 26, 2023, and subsequently
scrapped defense agreements with France, its traditional security
partner.</p>
<p>In Abuja, Blinken is anticipated to discuss the military coup in
Niger. The meeting comes just days after the country’s military junta
agreed to enhance relations with Russia.</p>
<p>American officials have stated that while the U.S. is open to
countries diversifying their partnerships, aligning with nations like
Russia could be problematic. They point to the situation in Mali, where
rising civilian casualties and security issues have followed Russian
paramilitary Wagner Group’s involvement and France’s withdrawal.</p>
<p>The French military withdrawal from the Sahel and the end of the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Mali in December have heightened concerns over
regional security.</p>
<p>Nigeria is the largest country by population and economy in
sub-Saharan Africa, and the dominant political, economic, and military
power in the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, and the
U.S. maintains a significant security partnership with Nigeria in its
counterterrorism operations against both Boko Haram and ISIS-West
Africa.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde</p>
<p>Blinken’s fourth African trip began Monday in Cape Verde and is
scheduled to close in Angola. State Department officials said key
priorities included bolstering security partnerships and enhancing
health and economic development in the region.</p>
<p>In Cape Verde’s capital, Praia, Blinken held talks Monday with Prime
Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and visited the city’s port, Porto da
Praia, which received funding for modernization efforts from the U.S.
government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation.</p>
<p>“It is extraordinary that Cabo Verde is the first country to complete
two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you’re starting
to build a third one,” said Blinken.</p>
<p>He also congratulated Cabo Verde’s malaria-free certification by the
World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Millennium Challenge Compacts are grant agreements designed to fund
specific programs that support economic growth.</p>
<p>Silva said Cabo Verde shares values of democracy and good governance
with the U.S. in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we condemned the
terrorist act of Hamas in Israel, and we defend solutions that make the
two states of Israel and Palestine viable,” he said. “We condemn coup
d’etat and changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the
republic that have occurred in Africa.”</p>
<p>Cabo Verde is a small island nation that has a large diaspora in the
United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Cabo Verde signed a Memorandum of Understanding on
defense cooperation in December 2022, focusing on maritime security.</p>
<p>Angola and Luanda Process</p>
<p>In a Monday call, Blinken spoke to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
President Félix Tshisekedi and discussed the concerns of election
observers as well as the need to enhance democratic confidence moving
forward.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that
they also discussed the crisis in eastern DRC and potential diplomatic
solutions.</p>
<p>Following a contentious December election, Tshisekedi, sworn in
Saturday for a second term, pledged to unify the country and address
conflicts in the east.</p>
<p>The worsening conflicts in eastern Congo have prompted countries in
the region to broker two peace initiatives: the so-called Luanda Process
and the Nairobi Process, according to Molly Phee, assistant secretary of
state for African Affairs.</p>
<p>Increasing tensions between Rwanda and the DRC have led to several
alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other’s
territory.</p>
<p>Angola leads the Luanda Process, where Blinken plans to hold talks
with Angolan President João Lourenço and Foreign Minister Téte
António.</p>
<p>Last week, Blinken met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he
reiterated the need for all actors to take concrete steps to ease
tensions.</p>
<p>Last November, Avril Haines, the director of U.S. national
intelligence, traveled to both Kinshasa and Kigali, meeting with leaders
from the two neighboring countries to secure a commitment to de-escalate
tensions in eastern DRC.</p>
<p>“We were able to institute a process of weekly check-ins that we
undertook through the end of calendar year 2023,” Phee told reporters
during a Thursday briefing.</p>

<h2 id="side-channels-are-common">Side Channels Are Common</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend
Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
</p>
<p>
We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones,
inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing
computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by
supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common
Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks
on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared
channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could
be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on
the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical
side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat
models…

Three days later, a fuselage panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight from Oregon, causing a sudden cabin decompression and leading to a temporary grounding of some of Boeing Co.&amp;#8217;s 737 Max 9 aircraft. The precise cause of that near-disaster is still to be determined. But following a spate of near-misses at US airports last year, both incidents underscore a sobering reality: The commercial aviation system is under growing stress.&lt;/p&gt;

those hostages are in the United States to raise awareness about an
issue they fear has been fading since the collapse of a November

id="us-uk-launch-more-strikes-targeting-weapons-in-houthi-controlled-yemen">US,
UK Launch More Strikes Targeting Weapons in Houthi-Controlled Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and
submarines, launched a series of strikes into Houthi-controlled areas of
Yemen late Monday, aimed at further degrading the capabilities of
Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks
against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across
eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as
missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance
capabilities.</p>
<p>The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons
systems not to amass casualties, a senior military official told
reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had
“more advanced conventional weaponry” in it than sites hit in the first
round of strikes on Jan. 11.</p>
<p>“These precision strikes … are in response to a series of illegal,
dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,” the U.S. and Britain said
in a statement, noting the latest strikes were carried out with the
support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce
in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued
threats,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world’s maritime traffic.
Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting
vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.</p>
<p>This is the eighth time U.S. military assets have struck Houthi
targets in the past 10 days, but only the second time Washington has had
help since Britain took part in the initial round of strikes earlier
this month. A senior military official told reporters the strikes Monday
had “removed significant capability” from the Houthis to launch
attacks.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official “directly attributed … the decline in the
number and the ferocity of the [Houthi’s] maritime attacks … to the
reduction in Houthi capability to carry out those attacks.”</p>
<p>“That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely
believe that has had an impact,” another U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on
international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say
their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack
from Israel.</p>
<p>Defense experts worry the United States is now fighting a regional
war in the Middle East amid a sharp increase in attacks on American
forces over the weekend.</p>
<p>Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday
there have been 151 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the
October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, including a “barrage” of
ballistic missiles fired at Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq that
constituted “a larger-scale attack than we have seen before.”</p>
<p>Most of the missiles were shot down, Singh said, but those that
landed on the base injured one Iraqi Security Forces member and caused
traumatic brain injuries in two U.S. service members.</p>
<p>The 151 attacks since October have injured at least 83 Americans in
Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official said on Monday. All but two have
returned to duty.</p>
<p>“We do not seek escalation. We don’t want to see it escalate,” Singh
said Monday in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>“If you’re in a scrap with somebody and you can find a way to tie one
or both of their hands behind their back, that’s not escalating. That’s
de-escalating. That’s taking ability away from the other party to
inflict harm,” John Kirby, National Security Council director of
strategic communications, told reporters Monday at the White House.</p>
<p>Critics like Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on
Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, say the U.S. military’s limited strikes against
Iranian-backed targets across the Middle East amount to a “shoulder
shrug” response to what he said was “absolutely” a “low-level, and in
some cases not-so-low-level regional war going on.”</p>
<p>“Don’t expect to have good policy coming out of Washington if we
can’t be objective and honest in assessing where we sit. Full points for
not wanting a regional war and trying to avoid a regional war, but news
flash, we appear to have one,” Bowman told VOA.</p>
<p>He added that as in any conflict, the adversary also gets a vote in
whether the Middle East violence erupts into a war.</p>
<p>“Our adversary here is [the] Islamic Republic of Iran and its network
of terror proxies, and they are repeatedly trying to kill Americans. And
the only reason why we haven’t had more American casualties [is] because
we’ve taken measures to defend ourselves, and we’ve gotten lucky. And
sooner or later, luck runs out,” Bowman said.</p>
<p>Most of the attacks against U.S. forces inside Syria and Iraq have
been claimed by an umbrella group calling itself the Islamic Resistance
in Iraq, which has said the attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s
support for Israel in the war.</p>
<p>Attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia on ships in and around the
Red Sea for the past several weeks have bogged down trade between Asia
and Europe and created fears of a widening war in the Middle East. Many
of the attacks by the Houthis have targeted ships that are not
associated with Israel.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, the U.S. sanctioned Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its
CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani, saying the airline provided
assistance to Iran’s military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria
and Lebanon.</p>

id="abortion-on-2024-ballot-biden-says-harris-tours-key-states">Abortion
on 2024 Ballot, Biden Says; Harris Tours Key States</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Abortion is on the ballot in 2024, the White House
says, with Vice President Kamala on Monday launching a cross-country
tour to equate the campaign of President Joe Biden with protection and
expansion of reproductive rights – as Republican candidates speak of
possible federal abortion bans.</p>
<p>On Monday — the 51st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court ruling that federally protected the right to have an abortion —
Harris visited the battleground state of Wisconsin to highlight the
Biden administration’s support of full access to reproductive health
care, including abortion.</p>
<p>“In America, freedom is not to be given,” Harris said. “It is not to
be bestowed. It is ours by right. By right. And that includes the
freedom to make decisions about one’s own body. Not the government
telling you what to do.”</p>
<p>Biden, a devoted lifelong Catholic, has expressed personal
reservations about abortion. On Monday, however, he described the
Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade — and throw the
matter to individual states — as unfair.</p>
<p>Since that court ruling, he noted, voters in different states have
repeatedly voted to uphold abortion access.</p>
<p>“Voters have voted to protect reproductive rights,” Biden said. “We
need these protections in every state, because for your family to have
access to health care should not depend on your ZIP code.”</p>
<p>Followers of the current Republican presidential front-runner, Donald
Trump, say Trump opposes abortion rights, but his position has varied
and is unclear. His campaign website does not address the issue.</p>
<p>A request for comment from Trump’s campaign was not immediately
returned.</p>
<p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from the Southern state
of Louisiana, gave his opposition a personal spin at a recent
anti-abortion rally in Washington, where he said he was the product of
an unplanned teen pregnancy.</p>
<p>“We’re passing these bills and we’re marching today because it takes
a lot of work to convince people that every single human child, every
unborn child, has a value that is too profound and precious to ignore,”
Johnson said. “And we have every reason to be optimistic, my friends,
that we can change public opinion.”</p>
<p>Anti-abortion-rights activists say they’re glad the Supreme Court put
the decision back in states’ hands. But now, they must decide which
national leader is going to move the issue forward.</p>
<p>Activist Eric Scheidler, who joined the Washington march, said that
Biden was “too extreme” in his support of abortion access but that none
of the remaining Republicans fit his worldview.</p>
<p>“I also don’t know if I trust Donald Trump,” said Scheidler, who is
executive director of the Illinois-based Pro-Life Action League. “I
mean, he gave us the Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe. Since
the overturning of Roe, he has said some things critical of the pro-life
movement and criticized [Governor Ron] DeSantis’ policy in Florida. I
don’t really know where Trump stands, because he seems to be talking out
of both sides of his mouth on the issue. So I am reserving judgment on
both Haley and Trump, because I’ve been concerned about where both of
them stand.”</p>
<p>Abortion rights have won at the polls with voters in states from
liberal California to conservative Kansas.</p>
<p>The key swing state of Ohio was the latest, with a decisive 57%

Music Student Faces US Trial for Allegedly Threatening Activist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — A Chinese music student went on trial Monday on U.S. charges
that he harassed an activist who posted flyers at the Berklee College of
Music in Boston supporting democracy in China and threatened to report
her activities to Chinese law enforcement.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Alathea Porter told a federal jury in Boston
that Xiaolei Wu, 25, scared the activist, referred to only as Zooey in
court, by making threats online to chop off her hands and report her to
the Chinese government because of her “reactionary posters.”</p>
<p>“She was afraid for herself, and she was afraid for her family, who
was back in China,” Porter said in her opening statement to a 12-person
jury.</p>
<p>The trial comes as U.S. and Western authorities continue to warn that
China’s government has increasingly exerted pressure to silence its
critics abroad.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have also complained of threats to academic
freedom and monitoring of Chinese students on international university
campuses.</p>
<p>Wu was first arrested in December 2022 and has pleaded not guilty to
charges of cyberstalking and interstate transmissions of threatening
communication.</p>
<p>Porter told jurors that his threats began after Zooey, who also
attended the private music college, posted a photo on Instagram of a
flier she put in a window that said, “We Want Freedom,” “We Want
Democracy” and “Stand with Chinese People.”</p>
<p>Wu in response in October 2022 posted on a 300-person chat of Chinese
Berklee students and alumni on the social media app WeChat a demand that
she tear down the flyers and said he had called in a tip to a Chinese
public security agency about her.</p>
<p>Porter called that a serious threat, as the Chinese government does
not allow the type of expression her posters contained and worked to
suppress dissent against the Chinese government.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Wu, Michael Tumposky, countered that Wu’s comments were
never meant to threaten Zooey but were made as part of an “immature,
online dispute between two young people,” who were acquainted with each
other.</p>
<p>He said his client “was not some agent of the Chinese government” but
an “awkward, nerdy guy” who came to Boston to learn jazz and had spoken
out about Zooey’s posters “in his own misguided way to remind her of
consequences of her activism.”</p>
<p>“He came here to learn guitar, not to shill for the Chinese Communist
Party,” he said.</p>

Three months after opening US orders for the long-anticipated three-row
EV9 SUV, the folks at <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia/">Kia
</a>invited media out to wine country to test drive it for the first
time. We’ve already had up-close encounters with the EV9, but this was
our first chance to take it for a spin and really test everything inside
and out (including that third row). While you probably can’t put
bodybuilders in the back seat, the EV9 delivers in a lot of ways other
OEMs are not and at a relatively enticing price point.

<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Ayjay blog</p>
<p>I’ve written before about how my own history as a fabulist makes me
reflexively skeptical about certain kinds of stories that people tell.
But it’s not my history as a fabulist, it’s rather my belief in original
sin that makes me skeptical of one particular kind of story: the “Doing

<h2 id="rubywm-an-x11-window-manager-in-pure-ruby">RubyWM: an X11 window
manager in pure Ruby</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a minimalist (currently &lt;1K lines) pure Ruby (including the
X11 driver) X11 window manager. It is focused on tiling, but allows you
to choose to assign a tiling layout to specific desktops or leave them
floating. Currently whether or not you use tiling or floating layout
there is no window decoration and windows are not draggable or resizable
by pulling on borders (but you can do that with Windows key + left/right
mouse button) Like bspwm, which was an inspiration, the wm supports no
keyboard handling – all keyboard handling is deferred to separate tools
like sxhkd. Unlike bspwm this WM has no dedicated IPC mechanism.
Instead, so far, all communication happens via X11 ClientMessage events,
which means any tool, like xdotool etc. that can produce those events
can control the WM. ↫ Vidar Hokstad on RubyWM’s GitHub page In the blog
post announcing RubyWM, the author makes it very clear that while he
uses this WM full time, he is also willing to work around its bugs, and
that certain tools will simply break if you use it. He considers it more
of a tech demo, and that you really shouldn’t rely on this for any
serious work.</p>

Street Loves Tesla for Its AI and Its Robots — Not for Its Cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE0OTM3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTA0OTY3NH0.T1-HweyVUs3vuHAXxPUlUdDLfL6x6NkdAhYt3zxIz7I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
What makes Tesla, the world’s leading automaker by market cap, so
valuable? The obvious answer would be that it sells hundreds of
thousands of cars every quarter, for which it can command a tidy premium
because of how much the Tesla name is worth. When it rolls out something
new —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cybertruck-tesla-elon-musk" target="_blank">no
matter how odd-looking</a> — Tesla fans are willing to put up money for
the right to order a vehicle years later. As many of the world’s biggest
economies try to transition away from internal combustion, Tesla is as
well positioned as anyone to benefit immensely.
</p>
<p>
But according to one of its biggest boosters on Wall Street, Tesla’s
core business of selling electric cars only contributes so
much.<span></span>
</p>
<p>
“Global EV momentum is stalling,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam
Jonas, a longtime Tesla booster, in a research report released Monday.
“The market is over-supplied vs. demand. We anticipate Tesla’s 2024
outlook to be cautious on volume and profitability.” He marked down his
estimate for Tesla’s 2024 sales to 2.08 million units, compared to his
previous estimate of 2.25 million, with profitability falling thanks to
the aggressive price cuts the company instituted last year in a bid to
juice sales. Then came the thing that really hurt: Jonas also adjusted
his price target for Tesla shares down from $380 to $345 — a figure well
north of the $212 the shares closed at on Friday, but still a noticeable
cut. Tesla shares traded down 1.5% through Monday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
For any other car company that exclusively sold EVs, this kind of price
target shrinkage would be a serious problem. But Jonas doesn’t see Tesla
as a car company. Or, at least, not <em>just</em> as a car company.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of the $345 Jonas thinks a Tesla share is worth, only $75 comes from
selling electric vehicles. The rest is largely from businesses that
either don’t exist for the company, or else don’t generate meaningful
revenue compared to selling cars.
</p>
<p>
Let’s break this down: In its most recent quarter, Tesla had around $23
billion of total revenues, $19.5 billion of which came from selling
cars; $1.5 billion came from its energy business, with the remaining $2
billion coming from “services and other revenue,” which include Tesla’s
Supercharging network.
</p>
<p>
To Jonas, however, Tesla “is both an auto stock + an energy, AI/robotics
company,” he wrote, adding that “we believe investors should not ignore
the continued developments of Tesla’s other bets.” These include things
like turning its cars into something more like software subscriptions,
which incur recurring revenues (as
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/full-self-driving-subscriptions#tesla-accordion-v2-8481-can-i-request-full-self-driving-beta-if-i-am-subscribed-to-tesla-full-self-driving-capabilities" target="_blank">Tesla
already does with its Full Self Driving software</a>) and a robotaxi
network that does not yet exist, but which Jonas projects will have
230,000 vehicles by 2030. There are also projects like the Optimus
humanoid robot, which Jonas didn’t put a valuation on but thinks that
investors should factor in when considering whether to buy or sell Tesla
shares.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of the gargantuan scale Jonas tends to operate on, last
year he wrote that Dojo, the supercomputer Tesla developed for its
automated driving system, could add $500 billion of value to Tesla, even
though “it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has
made about Dojo’s cost and performance.” He was confident, however, that
“Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution
given the company’s innovation track record and capabilities.”
</p>
<p>
The idea that Tesla can be more than an electric car company — one that
sprouts innovative and profitable businesses, whether from robotics or
artificial intelligence — stems almost entirely from the fact that Elon
Musk runs it. Musk himself is well aware of this. Last week
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/business/tesla-elon-musk-stock.html" target="_blank">he
wrote on X</a>, “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in A.I.
&amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control,” which would be about
double the voting power he has now. (That voting power, of course, was
substantially diluted thanks to selling billions of dollars of Tesla
shares to fund his takeover of now-X, then-Twitter.)
</p>
<p>
While it’s unlikely that Musk would be able to break off the robots and
AI initiatives that literally power Tesla, the threat is enough to spook
investors given Musk’s obvious willingness to pursue major projects
outside of Tesla (e.g. SpaceX) — and the high valuation those projects
can get from investors — not to mention the amount of time and energy
Musk spends on them.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
You can see the implicit value investors place on Tesla’s (and Musks’s)
ability to spin up new businesses not just in Tesla’s high stock price
and overall valuation — around $650 billion, compared to $270 billion
for Toyota and $50 billion for GM, both of which sell many, many more
cars— but also in how investors value Tesla’s earnings.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio, which is essentially the stock price
divided by the earnings per share, is around 60, comparable to Amazon or
the enterprise software company Workday, companies investors buy for
their future growth or profit potential derived from selling software on
a subscription basis. Plus, there’s a market mania for anything AI
related, as one can see with Nvidia, which makes the chips used by many
companies with AI products
(<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-were-using-a-lot-of-nvidia-hardware-174620935.html" target="_blank">including
Tesla</a>) and has gained several hundred billion dollars in market
capitalization in the last year. One can also see this with Microsoft,
whose OpenAI stake only gets more valuable,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/openai-sam-altman-board-nonprofits" target="_blank">company
drama notwithstanding</a>.<strong><em><br/></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Stolid GM, by contrast, trades at four times earnings, while Toyota is
around 10.
</p>
<p>
While some of this difference can be attributed to the higher prices
Tesla is able to charge for its vehicles, that can only account for so
much — Tesla’s best-selling cars are its lower-end vehicles, and again,
it’s been aggressively cutting prices. And while luxury automakers have
higher valuations than mass market car companies, Tesla still trades
higher than luxury automakers including Porsche, Ferrari, and BMW.
</p>
<p>
Jonas said in his note that his high valuation for the company “is
highly dependent upon Tesla accruing value as an
<a href="https://research.morganstanleyclientserv.com/eqr/article/webapp/b7e77ed8-7edb-11ee-8952-7bd1efab7f8a?ch=rpint&sch=sr&sr=1" target="_blank">AI
enabler</a>,” and that “any change of organizational or legal structure
that impedes Tesla’s ability to participate in the development of AI
could be detrimental.”
</p>
<p>
And Jonas isn’t the only analyst who sees a substantial portion of
Tesla’s value being made up of something beyond its current electric
vehicle business. “A key to our bullish thesis that all AI initiatives
be kept within Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a
note last week. “If Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own
company (separate from Tesla) for his next generation AI projects this
would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story.”
<strong><del></del></strong>
</p>
<p>
Even if Tesla reports a disappointing outlook for its electric vehicles
business with its fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday, expect analysts
and investors to be interested in what Tesla isn’t doing yet but could
be doing in the future — as long as Musk is still there.

Supreme Court Lets Border Patrol Cut Razor Wire Installed in Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed Border Patrol
agents to resume cutting for now razor wire that Texas installed along a
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border that is at the center of an escalating
standoff between the Biden administration and the state over immigration
enforcement. </p>
<p>The 5-4 vote clears the way for Border Patrol agents to cut or clear
out concertina wire that Texas has put along the banks of the Rio Grande
to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally. Some migrants have
been injured by the sharp wire and the Justice Department has argued the
barrier impedes the U.S. government’s ability to patrol the border,
including coming to the aid of migrants in need of help.</p>
<p>None of the justices provided any explanation for their vote. The
one-page order is a victory for the Biden administration while the
lawsuit over the wire continues. </p>
<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had authorized the wire, one of a series of
aggressive measures the three-term Republican has taken on the border in
the name of curbing illegal crossings from Mexico. His spokesman said
the absence of razor wire and other deterrents encourages migrants to
risk unsafe crossings and makes the job of Texas border personnel more
difficult. </p>
<p>“This case is ongoing, and Governor Abbott will continue fighting to
defend Texas’ property and its constitutional authority to secure the
border,” Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris said. </p>
<p>The White House applauded the order, which was handed down after a
federal appeals court last month had forced federal agents to stop
cutting the concertina wire.</p>
<p>“Texas’ political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border,
simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do
their jobs,” White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández
said. </p>
<p>The concertina wire stretches for roughly 48 kilometers near the
border city of Eagle Pass, where earlier this month the Texas Military
Department seized control of a city-owned park and began denying access
to Border Patrol agents. </p>
<p>Eagle Park has become one of the busiest spots on the southern U.S.
border for migrants illegally crossing from Mexico. Abbott has said
Texas won’t allow Border Patrol agents into Shelby Park anymore, having
expressed frustration over what he says are migrants illegally entering
through Eagle Pass and then federal agents loading them onto buses.</p>
<p>Abbott also has authorized installing floating barriers in the Rio
Grande near Eagle Pass and allowed troopers to arrest and jail thousands
of migrants on trespassing charges. </p>
<p>The administration also is challenging those actions in federal
court.</p>
<p>In court papers, the administration said the wire impedes Border
Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river and that,
in any case, federal immigration law trumps Texas’ own efforts to stem
the flow of migrants into the country.</p>
<p>Texas officials have argued that federal agents cut the wire to help
groups crossing illegally through the river before taking them in for
processing.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Ketanji
Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor sided with the
administration. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and
Clarence Thomas voted with Texas.</p>

‘Directly Involved’ in Yemen Houthi Rebel Ship Attacks, US Navy Official
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — Iran is “very directly involved” in ship attacks that
Yemen’s Houthi rebels have carried out during Israel’s war against
Hamas, the U.S. Navy’s top Mideast commander told The Associated Press
on Monday. </p>
<p>Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the head of the Navy’s 5th Fleet, stopped
short of saying Tehran directed individual attacks by the Houthis in the
Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. </p>
<p>However, Cooper acknowledged that attacks associated with Iran have
expanded from previously threatening just the Persian Gulf and its
Strait of Hormuz into waters across the wider Middle East. </p>
<p>“Clearly, the Houthi actions, probably in terms of their attacks on
merchant shipping, are the most significant that we’ve seen in two
generations,” he told the AP in a telephone interview. “The facts simply
are that they’re attacking the international community; thus, the
international response I think you’ve seen.” </p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations and the Houthi leadership in
Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, did not respond to a request for comment.
However, the Houthis later claimed to have attacked a U.S.-flagged
vessel, something that the 5th Fleet dismissed as “patently false.” </p>
<p>Since November, the Iranian-backed Houthis have launched at least 34
attacks on shipping through the waterways leading up to Egypt’s Suez
Canal, a vital route for energy and cargo coming from Asia and the
Middle East onward to Europe. </p>
<p>The Houthis, a Shiite rebel group that’s held Sanaa since 2014 and
been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s exiled government
since 2015, link their attacks to the Israel-Hamas war. However, the
ships they’ve targeted increasingly have tenuous links to Israel — or
none at all. </p>
<p>In recent days, the U.S. has launched seven rounds of airstrikes on
Houthi military sites, targeting air bases under the rebels’ control and
suspected missile launch sites. </p>
<p>However, risks for the global economy remain as many ships continue
to bypass that route for a longer trip around Africa’s southern tip.
That means lower revenue for Egypt through the Suez Canal, a vital
source of hard currency for the country’s troubled economy, as well as
higher costs for shipping that could push up global inflation. </p>
<p>As Cooper took command of the 5th Fleet in 2021, the threat to
shipping focused primarily around the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth,
the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. A
series of attacks blamed on Iran and ship seizures by Tehran followed
the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers. </p>
<p>In his interview with the AP, the Navy commander acknowledged the
threat from Iran’s proxies and that its distribution of weapons extended
from the Red Sea out to the far reaches of the Indian Ocean. The U.S.
has blamed Iran for recent drone attacks on shipping, and a U.S.-owned
cargo vessel came under attack from the Houthis in the Gulf of Aden last
week. </p>
<p>So far, Iran hasn’t become directly involved in fighting either
Israel or the U.S. since the war in Gaza began on October 7. However,
Cooper maintained Iran had been directly fueling the Houthi attacks on
shipping. </p>
<p>“What I’ll say is Iran is clearly funding, they’re resourcing, they
are supplying and they’re providing training,” Cooper said. “They’re
obviously very directly involved. There’s no secret there.” </p>
<p>Cooper described the ship attacks striking the Mideast as the worst
since the so-called Tanker War of the 1980s. It culminated in a one-day
naval battle between Washington and Tehran, and also saw the U.S. Navy
accidentally shoot down an Iranian passenger jet, killing 290 people in
1988. </p>
<p>Back then, American naval ships escorted reflagged Kuwaiti oil
tankers through the Persian Gulf and the strait after Iranian mines
damaged vessels in the region. Cooper said authorities had no current
plans to reflag ships and escort them past Yemen. </p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. and its allies employ a “zone defense, and every
once and a while we shift to a one-on-one,” he said. </p>
<p>Cooper’s reference to the tensions from more than three decades ago
underlines just how precarious the situation in the wider Mideast has
become as worries of a regional conflict over the Israel-Hamas war
grow. </p>
<p>Monday night, Houthi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya
Saree, in a recorded address, claimed an attack in the Gulf of Aden on
the Ocean Jazz, a U.S.-flagged ship managed by Seabulk, a company in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The firm declined to comment when reached by
the AP. The Ocean Jazz had been in the Red Sea heading south four days
ago, according to tracking data. </p>
<p>The 5th Fleet issued an online statement dismissing the Houthi
claim. </p>
<p>“The Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists’ report of an alleged
successful attack on M/V Ocean Jazz is patently false,” it said. The 5th
Fleet “has maintained constant communications with M/V Ocean Jazz
throughout its safe transit.” </p>
<p>Cooper spoke to the AP from the sidelines of a drone conference in
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Under his command of
the 5th Fleet, the naval force has created Task Force 59, a drone fleet
to bolster its patrol of waterways in the region. </p>
<p>Today, a variety of drones provide the 5th Fleet coverage across
about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) of Mideast waters
that the Navy otherwise wouldn’t have eyes on, Cooper said. That helps
its efforts to interdict suspected drug and weapons shipments. </p>
<p>U.S. forces seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry this
month from a ship bound for the Houthis in a raid that saw two Navy
SEALs go missing. The U.S. military’s Central Command said Sunday it now
believes the SEALs are dead. </p>
<p>While not directly saying his fleet’s drones played a part in the
seizure, Cooper hinted at it. </p>
<p>“They are specifically designed to conduct interdiction operations,”
he said. He added: “There’s no squeaking anything by it.” </p>
<p>Cooper’s command is set to end in February with the upcoming arrival
of Rear Adm. George Wikoff in Bahrain. He noted that the Navy and
merchant shippers still face a serious threat from the Houthis as he
prepares to leave. </p>
<p>“What we need is a Houthi decision to stop attacking international
merchant ships. Period,” Cooper said.</p>

id="dexter-scott-king-son-of-martin-luther-king-jr.-dies-of-cancer-at-62">Dexter
Scott King, Son of Martin Luther King Jr., Dies of Cancer at 62</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — Dexter Scott King, the younger son of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, died Monday after
battling prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The King Center in Atlanta, which Dexter King served as chairman,
said the 62-year-old son of the civil rights icon died at his home in
Malibu, California. His wife, Leah Weber King, said in a statement that
he died “peacefully in his sleep.”</p>
<p>The third of the Kings’ four children, Dexter King was named for the
Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where his father
served as a pastor when the Montgomery bus boycott launched him to
national prominence in the wake of the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>Dexter King was just 7 years old when his father was assassinated in
April 1968 while supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis,
Tennessee. In his 2004 memoir, Growing Up King, Dexter King recalled his
father’s slaying as the end of a carefree childhood.</p>
<p>“Ever since I was seven, I’ve felt I must be formal,” he wrote,
adding: “Formality, seriousness, certitude — all these are difficult
poses to maintain, even if you’re a person with perfect equilibrium,
with all the drama life throws at you.”</p>
<p>As an adult, Dexter King became an attorney and focused on
shepherding his father’s legacy and protecting the King family’s
intellectual property. In addition to serving as chairman of the King
Center, he was also president of the King estate.</p>
<p>In addition to his work with the King Center, Dexter King was known
for the striking resemblance he bore to his father. They looked so much
alike that the son ended up portraying his famous father in a 2002 TV
movie about Parks.</p>
<p>Coretta Scott King died in 2006, followed by the Kings’ oldest child,
Yolanda King, in 2007.</p>
<p>“Words cannot express the heartbreak I feel from losing another
sibling,” the Rev. Bernice A. King, the youngest of the four, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The oldest King son, Martin Luther King III, said: “The sudden shock
is devastating. It is hard to have the right words at a moment like
this. We ask for your prayers at this time for the entire King
family.”</p>

As some of you know, I like living on the edge hovering around 480 tabs
open - and I keep hitting the 500 limit.

Every few days I sacrifice some 50 good boys so I can continue browsing.

Today I discovered you can press this button and choose “new tab group

Supreme Court to Hear Oklahoma Man’s Death Row Appeal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The US Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear the case of
an Oklahoma man convicted of murder, whose story has sparked appeals for
clemency from Pope Francis and Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>Richard Glossip, 60, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal
injection on May 18, but the nation’s highest court put his execution on
hold.</p>
<p>The stay came after the Oklahoma attorney general, a Republican,
asked the court, in an unusual move, to halt the execution, citing
questions about the fairness of his trial.</p>
<p>Following the Supreme Court’s Monday announcement that it would hear
Glossip’s appeal, his lawyer John Mills said his team was “grateful” and
emphasized that Glossip had “maintained his innocence throughout a
quarter century.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Glossip has faced execution nine times, even though the state
knew full well that the evidence used to convict him and sentence him to
death was false,” Mills said.</p>
<p>Glossip was convicted of the 1997 fatal beating of an Oklahoma City
motel owner, but has steadfastly maintained his innocence.</p>
<p>Glossip, who worked at the motel, was found guilty of hiring another
motel employee, maintenance man Justin Sneed, who was 19 at the time, to
carry out the actual murder.</p>
<p>Glossip was convicted based on the testimony of Sneed, who pleaded
guilty and was able to negotiate a life sentence, claiming that his
co-worker had masterminded the plot.</p>
<p>Actors Mark Ruffalo and Susan Sarandon and British billionaire
Richard Branson have been among the celebrities advocating for Glossip’s
life to be spared.</p>
<p>In 2015, when Glossip’s execution also appeared imminent, the
representative of Pope Francis in the United States sent a letter on
behalf of the pontiff to the then governor of Oklahoma asking that the
execution be called off.</p>
<p>His case has also been the subject of a four-episode documentary
series titled “Killing Richard Glossip.”</p>

Biden Robo-Call Tells New Hampshire Voters To Stay Home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast
their votes in the state’s first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a
robo-call is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home -
using a fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden.  </p>
<p>“It’s important that you save your vote for the November
election….voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their
quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the call says.</p>
<p>The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is
investigating what he called an apparent “unlawful attempt to disrupt
the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New
Hampshire voters.”</p>
<p>“The Election Law Unit’s investigation is ongoing,” he said.</p>
<p>The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a
campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name on their ballots.
Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was
“disinformation” and an attempt to suppress voting.  </p>
<p>Support for Biden’s write-in campaign will be closely-watched amid
weak polls for the 81-year-old president, although the results have no
bearing on the Democratic Party’s nominating contest.  </p>
<p>The call was first reported by NBC News.  </p>
<p>Biden’s name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national
Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary,
ending New Hampshire’s historical status and angering some Democrats
there.</p>
<p>In the audio, the Biden “voice” is heard using one of his signature
phrases, “What a bunch of malarkey.”</p>
<p>The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan,
a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire
Democratic Party Chair.</p>
<p>Sullivan called the robo-call an attempt at election interference,
and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio
call was circulated.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday
night.</p>
<p>“Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message
created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an
attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire
primary,” she said.</p>
<p>She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number
without her permission.</p>
<p>The explosion of generative AI - which can create text, photos and
videos in response to open-ended prompts - in recent months has spurred
both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some
jobs obsolete, upend elections and even possibly overpower humans.</p>
<p>The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was
“absolutely not” involved in the robo-call.  </p>
<p>The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who
is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not
involved.</p>
<p>The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a
reporter on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable
affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is
deeply disturbing,” the Phillips campaign said.</p>

<h2 id="spreadsheets-are-the-best">Spreadsheets are the best</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Spreadsheets are the best
</h1>
<p>
I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know
Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important
electronic computing platform for the largest number people is …
spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread
from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers
planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs
failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as
a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories:
salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many
other things that should have used relational databases and REST
services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to
solve their problems.
</p>
<p>
Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated
by programmers, I think.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="maxime_andre">@maxime_andre</span></a>
linked me to the video
<a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure
Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she
explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.
</p>
<p>
And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as
far as they do not contribute to computers as
<a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial
tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to
solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They
must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a
spreadsheet to solve their problem!
</p>
<p>
Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including
non-technical people. It’s just that our current design paradigms
optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users.
Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don’t
expect inexperienced users any more.
</p>
<p>
We feel it’s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are
expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex
traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don’t
understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand,
cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion
engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool.
There’s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are
enforcers of conventions, penalties, there’s financing available if we
want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training
for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are
different.
</p>
<p>
One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that
explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one
gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of
using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and
extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software
that is as boring as it can be.
</p>
<p>
Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people
still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It’s a tool and not
an app.
</p>
<p>
If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let
non-technical people solve their problems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a
programming language for business people.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a
programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view,
I’d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away
from this goal.
</p>
<p>
These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are
tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of
everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail
to make computers into convivial tools.
</p>
<p>
The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure,
that didn’t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff
from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn
the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came
with a manual.
</p>
<p>
My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We
can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should
put spreadsheets front and centre.
</p>
<p>
The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that
essentially boot into the app store.

<p class="drop-caps">
Last September, Jeanie Ward-Waller, a deputy director at California’s
state transportation department, was called into her supervisor’s office
and told she was being removed from her role, no explanation given. But
Ward-Waller
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/caltrans-freeway-project-california-18449992.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thinks
she knows what happened</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks earlier, she’d threatened to blow the whistle on the agency
for a highway repaving project that she believed was covertly — and
illegally — going to widen the road. Under state law, highway expansions
require environmental review and public input. It was also exactly the
kind of project the agency was supposedly moving away from, according to
its climate action plan, which said it would prioritize alternative
forms of transit.
</p>
<p>
“Caltrans leaders believe they are widening highways in the public
interest, despite decades of empirical research proving otherwise, and
the agency’s own policies requiring solutions that reduce driving,”
Ward-Waller wrote in an essay for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>
after leaving the agency.
</p>
<p>
Ward-Waller’s firing riled up climate advocates and sustainable transit
proponents, and not just in California. (Multiple people I interviewed
for this story mentioned it to me.) State transportation agencies all
over the country are stuck in this kind of outdated thinking, critics
say. Transportation is the biggest source of emissions in the U.S., and
one of the
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only
sectors where emissions grew</a> last year. But most state
transportation agencies are still funneling most of their budgets into
road expansion projects. Few have taken on addressing climate change as
part of their mission.
</p>
<p>
“State departments of transportation are kind of the next frontier for
climate advocacy to conquer,” Justin Balik, the state program director
for Evergreen Action told me. “There’s a lot of blue states where the
transportation decisions are still divorced from the climate
conversation.”
</p>
<p>
It’s a pivotal moment to change that, Balik argued. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, signed in 2021, has been
<a href="https://rmi.org/states-will-determine-the-future-of-us-transportation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sending
billions of dollars of flexible funding</a> into states for
transportation projects. The Biden administration will also soon begin
requiring these agencies to
<a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-tool-moves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set
greenhouse gas reduction targets</a>. Although the targets are
non-binding and states won’t be penalized for failing to achieve them,
they will have to regularly report on their progress.
</p>
<p>
States have until February 1 to submit their initial plans to the
federal Department of Transportation. So on Monday, climate and clean
transportation advocates around the country
<a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/press/in-letters-to-governors-climate-and-transportation-orgs-call-for-strong-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-targets?utm_source=press&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent
letters</a> to the governors of 22 states urging them to set targets
consistent with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The letters ask
officials to consider what’s achievable both through vehicle
electrification and by reducing highway expansion.
</p>
<p>
“Electrification is critical and essential, but it’s not enough, just
looking at the math, in terms of how long it’s going to take for the
vehicle fleet to turn over,” said Balik. “We need to think about the
transportation system holistically and stop digging the hole deeper when
we’re making transportation investment decisions.”
</p>
<p>
He directed me to a
<a href="https://www.georgetownclimate.org/articles/federal-infrastructure-investment-analysis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
published by the Georgetown Climate Center after the infrastructure law
passed. The policy think tank modeled two scenarios, one where about a
third of the $600 billion of flexible funding went to highway expansion,
and one where states put more toward public transit and road
maintenance. It found that the first scenario would increase emissions
1.6% by 2032, compared to business-as-usual, whereas the second would
enable deeper emissions cuts — 1.3% more — than would otherwise have
been expected with market forces and existing policies.
</p>
<p>
The reason is an effect called “induced demand,” and it’s at the center
of this whole story. When state departments of transportation evaluate
projects, they use models that assume building new roads or adding lanes
increases the flow of traffic — thereby reducing congestion and reducing
emissions. But real-world evidence has shown that expanding highways,
especially in dense areas, actually encourages more people to drive —
and within a few years, the traffic is just as bad as before.
</p>
<p>
“They’re vastly overestimating the benefits of expansion projects,”
Miguel Moravec, a senior associate at RMI told me. “If the models are
not capturing the reality that expanded lanes lead to more traffic, then
you can’t really seriously engage with the pollution problem.”
</p>
<p>
The modeling is a symptom of a more entrenched issue. State Departments
of Transportation are big agencies that can have thousands of staff,
many of whom have been in their roles for decades. (Caltrans, for
example, has
<a href="https://dot.ca.gov/about-caltrans/executive-biographies/director" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than 22,000 people</a>.) The culture of these offices is built around an
old paradigm where the primary metric of performance is to relieve
traffic congestion — to help people drive places more quickly and
easily.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a new movement to say, maybe it’s about helping people get to
where they need to go efficiently, affordably, and safely,” Matt
Frommer, the senior transportation advocate at the Southwest Energy
Efficiency Project, told me. “But that is a really hard shift to make in
a giant institution like a state DOT. Because all of the models and all
of the policies and funding decision processes have been set up around
the old paradigm.”
</p>
<p>
Even in places where that’s beginning to shift, there are still
long-term challenges. California, for example, has had
<a href="https://www.sb743.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
law on the books for a decade</a> that says the state must assess the
impacts of transportation projects by measuring the amount of driving
they induce or reduce — not by their effect on congestion. But local
advocates like Jamie Pew, a climate advisor at NextGen Policy, say this
has failed to move the state meaningfully away from highway expansion.
</p>
<p>
Ward-Waller’s firing brought long-simmering criticisms of the state’s
climate strategy to a boil, he said. “For all of the money that we’re
investing in new transit infrastructure, electrification, and green
mobility options, as long as we continue to invest in freeway expansion,
we’re not going to see the progress in emissions that we need to see.”
</p>
<p>
There are a few states that are starting to do things differently.
Colorado, for example, has seen a significant shift in the way the state
approaches transportation projects. In 2021, the state legislature
passed a law directing its transportation agency to set regional
greenhouse gas reduction targets and incorporate them into project
planning. Frommer said the new approach has already resulted in real
changes. In 2022, the state scrapped a long-planned highway expansion
through downtown Denver after it was found that it would undermine the
agency’s targets.
</p>
<p>
“That freed up hundreds of millions, if not over a billion dollars for
other multimodal projects to help enable transit, biking and walking,”
said Frommer.
</p>
<p>
The state that is leading the nation in innovative transportation
policy, however, is Minnesota. Like Colorado, it has
transportation-specific greenhouse gas targets. But it also has a
specific goal to reduce “vehicle miles traveled” — a measure of how much
people drive. Last year, lawmakers passed a big transportation package
that gave more teeth to these goals, requiring the state’s DOT take them
into account in decision making. It also went a step further and said
that if the agency moves forward with any projects that induce demand,
it has to offset them with additional projects that get people out of
their cars.
</p>

a lawsuit</a> against environmental activists who are using a
shareholder resolution to push the oil giant to more aggressively cut
its planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The company accused the
shareholders from activist-investor groups Follow This and Arjuna
Capital of having an “extreme agenda” and wants their proposal removed
from the ballot so it cannot be voted on at the annual investor meeting.
The lawsuit is “highly unusual,”

week, down from 3,200. The company announced the news late last week,
saying it wanted its output to better match market demand.

the <em>FT</em> that the EV slowdown is real, but followed that up by
saying that “the EV market in the U.S. is still growing.” Stellantis CEO

admirable quest. A Danish company called Too Good To Go has developed AI

Scrutiny of Boeing planes have grown beyond the 737 Max 9, the aircraft
that was thrust into the spotlight following the Alaska Airlines
accident earlier this month. The Federal Aviation Administration has
urged airlines to inspect some older 737 model with the same door plug
designs as the Max 9. We’ll explore what’s at stake. Plus, higher
interest rates and the troubled commercial real estate are piling
pressure onto regional banks.

Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly horror-story (21 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly horror-story: 43
years later, Reagan’s other shoe drops. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly
horror-story (permalink) Last week, William Young, an 82 year old
federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, blocked the merger of Spirit
Airlines and Jetblue. It was a seismic event:
https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.254267/gov.uscourts.mad.254267.461.0_6.pdf
Seismic because the judge’s opinion is full of rhetoric associated with
the surging antitrust revival, sneeringly dismissed by corporate
apologists as “hipster antitrust.” Young called America’s airlines and
“oligopoly,” a situation he blamed on out-of-control mergers. As Matt
Stoller writes, this is the first airline merger to be blocked by the
DOJ and DOT since deregulation in 1978:
https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-block-the-jetblue
The judge wasn’t shy about why he was reviving a pre-Jimmy Carter theory
of antitrust: “[the merger] does violence to the core principle of
antitrust law, ‘to protect] markets –- and its market participants —
from anticompetitive harm.” The legal arguments the judge advances are
fascinating and worthy of study:
https://twitter.com/johnmarknewman/status/1747343447227519122 But what
really caught my eye was David Dayen’s American Prospect article about
the judge’s commentary on the state of the aviation industry:
https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/01-19-2024-how-boeing-ruined-the-jetblue-spirit-merger/
Why, after all, have Spirit and Jetblue been so ardent in pursuing
mergers? Jetblue has had two failed merger attempts with Virgin, and
this is the third time they’ve failed in an attempt to merge with
Spirit. Spirit, meanwhile, just lost a bid to merge with Frontier. Why
are these two airlines so obsessed with combining with each other or any
other airline that will have them? As Dayen explains, it’s because US
aviation has been consumed by monopoly, hollowed out to the point of
near collapse, thanks to neoliberal policies at every part of the
aviation supply-chain. For one thing, there’s just not enough pilots,
nor enough air-traffic controllers (recall that Reagan’s first major act
in office was to destroy the air traffic controller’s union). But even
more importantly, there are no more planes. Boeing’s waitlist for
airplane delivery stretches to 2029. And Boeing is about to deliver a
lot fewer planes, thanks to its disastrous corner-cutting, which
grounded a vast global fleet of 737 Max aircraft (again):
https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-01-09-boeing-737-max-financial-mindset/
The 737 disaster(s) epitomize the problems of inbred, merger-obsessed
capitalism. As Luke Goldstein wrote, the rampant defects in Boeing’s
products can be traced to the decision to approve Boeing’s 1997 merger
with McDonnell-Douglas, a company helmed by Jack Welch proteges,
notorious for cost-cutting at the expense of reliability:
https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-01-09-boeing-737-max-financial-mindset/
Boeing veterans describe the merger as the victory of the bean-counters,
which led to a company that chases short-term profits over safety and
even the viability of its business:
https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=213075 After all, the
merger turned Boeing into the single largest exporter in America, a
company far too big to fail, teeing up tens of billions from Uncle
Sucker, who also account for 40% of Boeing’s income:
https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-time-to-nationalize-and-then The
US government is full of ex-Boeing execs, just as Boeing’s executive row
is full of ex-US federal aviation regulators. Bill Clinton’s
administration oversaw the creation of Boeing’s monopoly in the 1990s,
but it was the GOP that rescued Boeing the first time the 737 Maxes
started dropping out of the sky. Boeing’s biggest competitor is the
state-owned Airbus, a joint venture whose major partners are the
governments of France, Spain and Germany – governments that are at least
theoretically capable of thinking about the public good, not short-term
profits. Boeing’s largest equity stakes are held by the Vanguard Group,
Vanguard Group subfiler, Newport Trust Company, and State Street
Corporation:
https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2024-01-18-airbus-advantage/
As Matt Stoller says, America has an airline that the public bails out,
protects, and subsidizes but has no say over. Boeing has all the costs
of public ownership and none of the advantages. It’s the epitome of
privatized gains and socialized losses. This is Reagan’s other legacy,
besides the disastrous shortage of air-traffic controllers. The
religious belief in deregulation – especially deregulation of antitrust
enforcement – leads to a deregulated market. It leads to a market that
is regulated by monopolists who secretly deliberate, behind closed
board-room doors, and are accountable only to their shareholders. These
private regulators are unlike government regulators, who are at least
nominally bound by obligations to transparency and public
accountability. But they share on thing in common with those public
regulators: when they fuck up, the public has to pay for their mistakes.
It’s a good thing Boeing’s executives are too big to fail, because they
fail constantly. Boeing execs who are warned by subcontractors of
dangerous defects in their planes order those subcontractors to lie, or
lose their contracts:
https://www.levernews.com/boeing-supplier-ignored-warnings-of-excessive-amount-of-defects-former-employees-allege/
As a result of Boeing’s mismanagement, America’s only aircraft supplier
steadily has lost ground to Airbus, which today enjoys a 2:1 advantage
over Boeing. But it’s not just Boeing that’s the weak link aviation. US
aviation is a chain entirely composed of weak links. Take jet engines:
Pratt &amp; Whitney are Spirit’s major engine supplier, but these
engines suck as much as Boeing’s fuselages. Much of Spirit’s fleet is
chronically grounded because the engines don’t run. The reason Spirit
buys its engines from those loveable goofballs at Pratt &amp; Whitney?
The Big Four airlines have bought all the engines for sale from other
suppliers, leaving smaller airlines to buy their engines from
fat-fingered incompetents. This is why – as Dayen notes – smaller US
airlines are so horny for intermarriage. They can’t grow by adding
routes, because there are no pilots. Even if they could get pilots,
there’d be no slots because there are no air traffic controllers. But
even if they could get pilots and slots, there are no planes, because
Boeing sucks and Airbus can’t make planes fast enough to supply the
airlines that don’t trust Boeing. And even if they could get aircraft,
there are no engines because the Big Four aviation cartel cornered the
market on working jet engines. Part of Jetblue and Spirit’s pitch was
that they hand off the routes that they’d cut after their merger to
other small airlines, like Frontier and Allegiant. But Frontier and
Allegiant can’t service those routes: they don’t have pilots, slots,
planes or engines. Spirit hasn’t been profitable since 2019 and is
sitting on $4b in debt. Jetblue was proposing to finance its acquisition
with another $3.5b in debt. The resulting airline could only be
profitable by sharply cutting routes and massively raising prices,
cutting 6.1m seats/year. With a debt:capital ratio of 111%, the company
would have no slack and would need a bailout any time anything went
wrong. Not coincidentally, the Big Four airlines also have debt:capital
ratios of about 100-120%, and they do get bailouts ever time anything
goes wrong. As William McGee reminds us, it’s been 14 years since
anyone’s started a new US airline:
https://twitter.com/WilliamJMcGee/status/1747363491445375072 US aviation
is deeply cursed. But Boeing’s self-disassembling aircraft show us why
we can’t fix it by allowing mergers: private monopolies, shorn of the
discipline of competition and regulation, are extraction machines that
turn viable businesses into debt-wracked zombies. This is a subject
that’s beautifully illustrated in Dayen’s 2020 book Monopolized, in the
chapter on health care:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu The US
health care system has been in trouble for a long time, but the current
nightmare starts with the deregulation of pharma. Pharma companies
interbred with one another in a string of incestuous marriages that
produced these dysfunctional behemoths that were far better at shifting
research costs to governments and squeezing customers than they were at
making drugs. The pharma giants gouged hospitals for their products, and
in response, hospitals underwent their own cousin-fucking merger orgy,
producing regional monopolies that were powerful enough to resist
pharma’s price-hikes. But in growing large enough to resist pharma
profiteering, the hospitals also became powerful enough to screw over
insurers. Insurers then drained their own gene pool by combining with
one another until most of us have three or fewer insurers we can sign up
with – companies that are both big enough to refuse hospital
price-hikes, and to hike premiums on us. Thus monopoly begets monopoly:
with health sewn up by monopolies in medical tech, drugs, pharmacy
benefit managers, insurance, and hospitals, the only easy targets for
goosing profits are people:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/05/hillrom/#baxter-international This is
how you get a US medical system that costs more than any other rich
nation’s system to operate, delivers worse outcomes than those other
systems, and treats medical workers worse than any other wealthy
country. Now, rich people can still buy their way out of this mess, but
you have to be very rich indeed to buy your way out of the commercial
aviation system. There’s a lot of 1%ers who fly commercial, and they’re
feeling the squeeze – and there’s no way they’re leasing their own jets.
Stein’s Law holds that “anything that can’t go on forever will
eventually stop.” America’s aviation mergers – in airlines, aircraft and
engines – have hollowed out the system. The powerful, brittle companies
that control aviation have so much power over their workforce that
they’ve turned air traffic controller and pilot into jobs that no one
wants – and they used their bailout money to buy out the most senior
staff’s contracts, sending them to early retirement. Now, I’m with the
people who say that most of US aviation should be replaced with
high-speed rail, but that’s not why our technocrats and finance barons
have gutted aviation. They did it to make a quick buck. A lot of quick
bucks. Now the system is literally falling to pieces in midair. Now the
system is literally on fire:
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/us/miami-boeing-plane-engine-fire.html
Which is how you get a Reagan appointed federal judge issuing an opinion
that has me punching the air and shouting, “Yes, comrade! To the
barricades!” Anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop.
When the system is falling to pieces around you, ideology disintegrates

Designed to attract foreign business, Australia’s visa scheme was cut in

poor economic outcomes.” Also on the program: A month-long fishing ban
comes into force off the French Atlantic coast today. Then we’ll head to
Bolivia, the world’s biggest exporter of Brazil nuts. But nut producers
there are grappling with volatile prices.

I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with
people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to
engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of
them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes
over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe
it’s important to connect with others.

<p>
I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about
others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re
passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please
do get in touch.

Hampshire Voters May Surprise in Tuesday’s Primary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The small northeastern U.S. state of New Hampshire holds its
presidential primary Tuesday. The state, which prides itself on
independence and creating havoc, takes on added interest with Sunday’s
news that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his campaign, making it a
two-person Republican contest. VOA’s Carolyn Presutti is there and
explains how the Granite State could turn politics upside-down on
Tuesday. VOA footage and video editing by Adam Greenbaum.</p>

Kicks Off Africa Tour Focused on Security, Economic Partnerships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — The United States is committed to deepening and
strengthening partnerships across Africa, U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken said Monday, kicking off a four-nation tour on the continent to
signal Washington’s interests there despite ongoing conflicts in the
Middle East and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Blinken starts his fourth African trip this week, visiting Cabo
Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Angola. Key priorities include
bolstering security partnerships and enhancing health and economic
development in the region.</p>
<p>Cabo Verde</p>
<p>In Cabo Verde’s capital, Praia, Blinken held talks Monday with Prime
Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and visited the city’s port, Porto da
Praia, which received funding for modernization efforts from the U.S.
government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation. </p>
<p>“It is extraordinary that Cabo Verde is the first country to complete
two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you’re starting
to build a third one,” said Blinken.</p>
<p>He also congratulated Cabo Verde’s malaria-free certification by the
World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Millennium Challenge Compacts are grant agreements designed to fund
specific programs that support economic growth.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva said Cabo Verde shares values
of democracy and good governance with the U.S. in its foreign
policy.</p>
<p>“We strongly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we condemned the
terrorist act of Hamas in Israel, and we defend solutions that make the
two states of Israel and Palestine viable. We condemn coup d’etat and
changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the republic
that have occurred in Africa.”</p>
<p>Cabo Verde is a small island nation that has a large diaspora in the
United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Cabo Verde signed a Memorandum of Understanding on
defense cooperation in December 2022, focusing on maritime security.</p>
<p>Soccer match in Ivory Coast</p>
<p>Later Monday, Blinken arrived in Abidjan, the largest city and the
economic capital of Cote d’Ivoire, or Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat’s trip to West Africa comes as Washington
deepens its economic and security partnership in regions where China and
Russia have made significant inroads.</p>
<p>Blinken watched a soccer match late Monday at the Chinese-built
Alassane Ouattara Olympic Stadium, where the Ivory Coast, host of the
Africa Cup of Nations, played against Equatorial Guinea in what is
considered the most important football tournament in Africa.</p>
<p>Blinken’s visit to Ivory Coast is seen as reflecting U.S. interests
in its stability and the country’s preparations for the 2025
presidential election. Blinken is scheduled to meet with President
Alassane Ouattara on Tuesday. Food security is expected to be high on
the agenda during the talks as well as during Blinken’s Tuesday meeting
with the African Development Bank in Abidjan.  </p>
<p>The U.S. and international community are concerned about stability in
the Sahel sub-region of west Africa following several coups in Mali,
Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger since 2020.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in
recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in both August 2020 and May
2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September of 2022.</p>
<p>The United States plans to provide $45 million in new funding to aid
Ivory Coast and its neighbors in preventing conflict and promoting
stability amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S.
stability-focused assistance in Coastal West Africa to nearly $300
million since 2022.</p>
<p>Regional security talks in Nigeria</p>
<p>Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its
elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, on July 26, 2023, and subsequently
scrapped defense agreements with France, its traditional security
partner. Bazoum remains under house arrest in Niamey.</p>
<p>In Abuja, Blinken is anticipated to discuss the military coup in
Niger, coming just days after the country’s military junta agreed to
enhance relations with Russia.</p>
<p>American officials have stated that while the U.S. is open to
countries diversifying their partnerships, aligning with nations like
Russia could be problematic. They point to the situation in Mali, where
rising civilian casualties and security issues have followed Russian
paramilitary Wagner Group’s involvement and France’s withdrawal.</p>
<p>The French military withdrawal from the Sahel and the end of the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Mali last December have heightened concerns over
regional security.</p>
<p>Nigeria is the largest country by population and economy in
sub-Saharan Africa, and the dominant political, economic, and military
power in the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, and the
U.S. maintains a significant security partnership with Nigeria in its
counterterrorism operations against both Boko Haram and ISIS-West
Africa.</p>
<p>Angola and Luanda Process</p>
<p>In a Monday call, Blinken spoke to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
President Félix Tshisekedi and discussed the concerns of election
observers as well as the need to enhance democratic confidence moving
forward.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that
they also discussed the crisis in eastern DRC and potential diplomatic
solutions.</p>
<p>Following a contentious December election, Tshisekedi, sworn in
Saturday for a second term, pledged to unify the country and address
conflicts in the east.</p>
<p>Worsening conflicts in eastern Congo have prompted countries in the
region to broker two peace initiatives: the so-called Luanda Process and
the Nairobi Process, according to Molly Phee, assistant secretary of
state for African Affairs.</p>
<p>Increasing tensions between Rwanda and the DRC have led to several
alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other’s
territory.</p>
<p>Angola leads the Luanda Process, where Blinken plans to hold talks
with Angolan President Joao Lourenco and foreign minister Tete
Antonio.</p>
<p>Last week, Blinken met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he
reiterated the need for all actors to take concrete steps to ease
tensions.</p>
<p>Last November, Avril Haines, the director of U.S. national
intelligence, traveled to both Kinshasa and Kigali, meeting with leaders
from the two neighboring countries to secure a commitment to de-escalate
tensions in eastern DRC.</p>
<p>“We were able to institute a process of weekly check-ins that we
undertook through the end of calendar year 2023,” Phee told reporters
during a Thursday briefing.</p>

<p>On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court handed down the Roe v. Wade
decision. By a 7–2 vote, the Supreme Court found that the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed the right of privacy under its
“concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action.” This
right to privacy, the court said, guarantees a pregnant woman the right

id="stanfords-tara-vanderveer-now-winningest-coach-in-major-college-basketball">Stanford’s
Tara Vanderveer Now Winningest Coach in Major College Basketball</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STANFORD, Calif. — Tara VanDerveer’s face shined in every corner of
Maples Pavilion with that very message. Yes, the Stanford Hall of Famer
now stands atop major college basketball as the winningest coach of all
time.</p>
<p>“Today was just so wonderful,” VanDerveer said. Even though she had
to text her 96-year-old mother, Rita, they’d need to cancel a scheduled
bridge game because of all the postgame festivities to celebrate her.
“It is a big number and I’m very appreciative of the great players I’ve
coached and the great places I’ve been and the attention it’s brought to
women’s basketball.”</p>
<p>Just as those who love her so hoped it would turn out, VanDerveer
passed former Duke and Army coach Mike Krzyzewski with her 1,203rd
career victory at home in Maples when No. 8 Stanford beat Oregon State,
65-56.</p>
<p>And it never fails that VanDerveer always takes a minute to thank
everybody for coming to the game, and that includes offering her immense
gratitude to the Stanford band. On Sunday, moments after her latest
remarkable milestone in a career filled with them, she politely asked
the band to stop playing. VanDerveer took the microphone and began with
her words of appreciation once more.</p>
<p>“I’m overwhelmed,” she told the crowd. “I’m not usually lost for
words but it’s pretty impressive, all these people here, all the former
players coming back.”</p>
<p>A head coach since age 24, VanDerveer celebrated with thousands of
supporters and a couple dozen former players on hand to cheer her on for
yet another triumph in a decorated 45-year career featuring so many
memorable accomplishments.</p>
<p>And for a nearly full arena, this was also a chance for fans to show
their love to the Hall of Fame coach who has been shining her light on
women’s basketball for 4 1/2 decades.</p>
<p>“Tara! Tara!” they yelled in the closing seconds before the
celebration began.</p>
<p>“This is a tremendous accomplishment for Tara VanDerveer, who is
already one of the most accomplished coaches in the history of
basketball,” Krzyzewski said in a statement. “This is yet another
milestone to add to an amazing legacy. More important than all the
astounding numbers and career accomplishments, she’s positively impacted
countless lives as a coach and a mentor. Tara remains a true guardian of
our sport.”</p>
<p>A video tribute with messages from everyone from Billie Jean King to
Steve Kerr, Dawn Staley and Coach K himself showed on the big
screen.</p>
<p>It was tense at times, with VanDerveer standing with arms crossed and
pacing the sideline as Kiki Iriafen and her supporting cast made the big
plays when it mattered most — including Iriafen’s first 3-pointers.
Stanford was missing All-American Cameron Brink because of a lower left
leg injury suffered in Friday’s win over Oregon.</p>
<p>“I want to bring attention to the beauty of women’s basketball and
the wonderfulness of these players that work so hard,” VanDerveer said.
“I’m so jealous because I never got to do what they get to do and I’m
able to watch a little girl’s dream play out through them.”</p>
<p>Iriafen contributed a career-high 36 points on 16-for-26 shooting and
11 rebounds and Talana Lepolo 14 points and six assists for the Cardinal
(17-2, 6-1 Pac-12). The game drew a near-capacity crowd of 7,022 at
Maples Pavilion, which holds 7,233.</p>
<p>VanDerveer improved to 1,203-267 overall and 1,051-216 over 38
seasons at Stanford. A 17-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year with five
national Coach of the Year honors, VanDerveer has captured three NCAA
titles with Stanford — 1990, ’92 and 2021 — and coached the 1996 U.S.
Olympic team to a gold medal at the Atlanta Games during a year away
from Stanford.</p>
<p>Stanford led 28-22 at the break having shot just 12 of 34 but was
willed in the second half as former star players such as Jennifer Azzi,
Chiney Ogwumike, Ros Gold-Onwude and Jayne Appel-Marinelli were among
those in attendance along with former U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice supporting the beloved coach.</p>
<p>“What does it mean to me? It means everything. It’s like your family
member getting married or someone had a baby, Coach is making history,
we all come back and we celebrate,” Ogwumike said. “It’s just a part of
our life now. Showing up for Tara is the same way you show up for a
sister, an aunt, a brother. She’s family to all of us.”</p>
<p>VanDerveer received warm ovations at every chance, from the moment
she walked out onto the court during pregame warmups and again for
introductions. She credited the Beavers for their grace in offering
congratulations in the hand-shake line after the final buzzer.</p>
<p>Oregon State coach Scott Rueck credits VanDerveer for elevating the
entire conference over the decades.</p>
<p>“The most remarkable thing about her is she’s done it for so long and
she’s remained at such a high level of excellence,” Rueck said. “And
that’s her preparation, her attention to detail is the separator.”</p>
<p>Azzi offered a sentiment that hundreds of other former VanDerveer
players would certainly share: “I got to play for the greatest coach of
all-time.”</p>

<h2 id="epa-assessment-shows-almost-no-gains-in-nitrogen-pollution">EPA
Assessment Shows Almost No Gains in Nitrogen Pollution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>St. LOUIS — The nation’s rivers and streams remain stubbornly
polluted with nutrients that contaminate drinking water and fuel a
gigantic dead zone for aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, according to
a recently released Environmental Protection Agency assessment.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult problem that’s concentrated in agricultural regions
that drain into the Mississippi River. More than half of the basin’s
miles of rivers and streams were in poor condition for nitrogen and
phosphorus from fertilizer that drains into waterways, the agency found.
For decades, federal and state officials have struggled to control farm
runoff, the biggest source of nutrient pollution that is not typically
federally regulated.</p>
<p>It’s a problem only expected to get harder to control as climate
change produces more intense storms that dump rain on the Midwest and
South. Those heavy rains flood farm fields, pick up commercial
fertilizers and carry them into nearby rivers.</p>
<p>“It’s really worrying that we are clearly not meeting the goals that
we’ve set for ourselves,” said Olivia Dorothy, director of river
restoration with the conservation group American Rivers.</p>
<p>The assessment is based on samples collected in 2018 and 2019 and it
allows experts to compare river conditions from previous rounds of
sampling, although different sampling sites were used. It takes years
for the agency to compile the results and release the report, which is
the most comprehensive assessment of the nation’s river and stream
health. Phosphorus levels dipped slightly while nitrogen levels remained
almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>About half of all river miles were found to be in poor condition for
snails, worms, beetles and other bottom-dwelling species that are an
important indicator of biological health of the river. About a third
were also rated as having poor conditions for fish based on species
diversity.</p>
<p>“Controlling pollution is a big job. It is hard work,” said Tom Wall,
director of watershed restoration, assessment and protection division at
EPA. “Things are not getting worse, despite the tremendous pressures on
our waterways. And we would like to see more progress.”</p>
<p>Water pollution from factories and industry is typically federally
regulated. The Biden administration recently proposed toughening
regulations on meat and poultry processing plants to reduce pollution,
Wall said.</p>
<p>When nutrient pollution flows into the Gulf of Mexico, it spurs
growth of bacteria that consume oxygen. That creates a so-called “dead
zone,” a vast area where it’s difficult or impossible for marine animals
to survive, fluctuating from about the size of Rhode Island to the size
of New Jersey, according to Nancy Rabalais, professor of oceanography
and wetland studies at Louisiana State University.</p>
<p>That affects the productivity of commercial fisheries and marine life
in general, but nutrient pollution is also damaging upstream. Too much
nitrate in drinking water can affect how blood carries oxygen, causing
human health problems like headaches, nausea and abdominal cramps. It
can especially affect infants, sometimes inducing “blue baby syndrome,”
which causes the skin to take on a bluish hue.</p>
<p>The EPA established the hypoxia task force in the late 1990s to
reduce nutrient pollution and shrink the dead zone, but it relies on
voluntary efforts to reduce farm runoff and hasn’t significantly reduced
the dead zone.</p>
<p>Anne Schechinger, Midwest director with the Environmental Working
Group, said new regulations are needed, not voluntary efforts. She said
the Biden administration has done a lot to improve drinking water, but
not enough to reduce agricultural runoff.</p>
<p>Methods to prevent runoff include building buffers between farmland
and waterways, creating new wetlands to filter pollutants and applying
less fertilizer.</p>
<p>It’s a politically fraught issue, especially in major Midwest farming
states that significantly contribute to the problem. Many of those
states cite their voluntary conservation programs as evidence they’re
taking on the problem, yet the new EPA data shows little progress.</p>
<p>Minnesota is one of the few states that has a so-called “buffer law”
that requires vegetation to be planted along rivers, streams and public
drainage ditches. But because groundwater and surface water are closely
connected in much of the Upper Midwest, nutrient pollution can end up
leaching underground through farm fields and eventually bypass those
buffers, ending up in streams anyway, said Gregory Klinger, who works
for the Olmsted County, Minnesota soil and water conservation
district.</p>
<p>There should also be a focus on preventing over-fertilizing – about
30% of farmers are still using more than the recommended amounts of
fertilizer on their fields, said Brad Carlson, an extension educator
with the University of Minnesota who communicates with farmers about
nutrient pollution issues.</p>
<p>Martin Larsen, a farmer and conservation technician in southeast
Minnesota, said he and other farmers are interested in practices that
reduce their nutrient pollution. He’s broken up his typical corn and
soybean rotation with oats and medium red clover, the latter a kind of
plant that can increase nitrogen levels in the soil naturally. He’s been
able to get by with about half as much fertilizer for a corn crop that
follows a clover planting as compared to a corn-corn rotation.</p>
<p>Growing oats and red clover as cover crops improves soil, too. But
Larsen said it’s difficult for many farmers to plant them when they
often rely on an immediate payback for anything they grow. Cover crops
are planted on just 5.1% of harvested farmland, according to 2017 data
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Larsen said since regulations are so unpopular, more should be done
to incentivize better practices. For example, he said that could include
companies shifting the makeup of feed they use for animals, giving
farmers an opening to plant some crops that use less fertilizer. Or
government programs that do more to subsidize things like cover
crops.</p>
<p>He said that many farmers in his community acknowledge the need to do
things differently. “But we also feel very trapped in the system,” he
said.</p>

developer Waddlesplash</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Haiku developer and community member Waddlesplash shares his insights
on the project’s current state, challenges ahead, and hopes for the
future. Waddlesplash discusses Haiku’s transition from a niche project
to a potential daily driver OS, emphasizing the importance of
maintaining momentum and addressing data corruption bugs. ↫ Andrea at
Desktop On Fire! Haiku is definitely in a good place at the moment, and
there’s some real momentum from outside the project. Yes, it’s even
possible to daily-drive Haiku – with caveats, of course – and I hope
they can keep this going.</p>

<h2 id="whats-that-touchscreen-in-my-room">What’s that touchscreen in my
room?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons
I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was
finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for
winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room.
However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too
smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was
zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what
this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow
light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is
an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course,
how to hack it and make it more useful.</p>

PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 / Call for Papers &amp; Sponsors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 (P2D2 2024) will be held on June 4
and 5 in Prague, Czech Republic. The conference focuses on topics for
PostgreSQL users and developers. For more information about the event,
please see the website at
<a href="https://www.p2d2.cz/">https://www.p2d2.cz/</a>
</p>
<p>
We are now accepting proposals for talks and trainings in both Czech and
English. As in previous years, the conference is a single-track event
with a mix of talks in Czech and English.
</p>
<p>
To submit a talk, use this form:
</p>
<pre><code> https://p2d2.cz/call-for-papers
</code></pre>
<p>
The talk sessions are generally 45 minutes long (but may be shorter if
requested) and may be on any PostgreSQL-related topic. We’re also
looking for trainings (either half-day or whole-day) for the first day
(June 4). To submit a training proposal, use the same form as for
regular talks (there’s a field to pick talk/training).
</p>
<p>
Finally, we are considering to include a session of lightning talks
(short talks, five minute each). A separate call for proposals will be
made for them during the event.
</p>
<p>
The submission deadline is March 1 (which is Friday), end of day.
Selected speakers will be notified / confirmed shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The proposals will be considered by committee who will produce a
schedule to be published about a month before the event.
</p>
<p>
All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
training sessions). We do offer covering travel and accommodations for
foreign speakers (generally enough for two nights in a hotel and travel
within Europe). If you require assistance with funding to be able to
attend, please make a note of this in the submission notes field.
</p>
<p>
We have also opened our call for sponsors. As usual, we we’ll offer
three sponsorship levels - the details are available at:
</p>
<pre><code>https://p2d2.cz/rocnik-2024/sponsorship
</code></pre>
<p>
If you wish to become a sponsor, or have questions/suggestions regarding
sponsorship, please contact us at sponsors@p2d2.cz (we’re happy to
answer any questions about the event and sponsorship conditions).
</p>
<p>
We look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you in Prague!
