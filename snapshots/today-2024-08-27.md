</p><h3>2. U.S. heat-related deaths on the rise</h3><p>
	Extreme heat killed 2,325 people in America last year, the highest number in nearly 25 years, according to a new <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822854?guestAccessKey=53b50a89-0945-4117-a662-5e1e1484ebce&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=082624&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em><em>American Medical Association</em></em>. The data shows 21,518 heat-related deaths since 1999, with the number of deaths remaining steady until 2016, when they began to rise noticeably. Last year the number surpassed 2,000 for the first time in the recorded time period. The age-adjusted rate of heat deaths per capita has also been rising. It stood at 0.17 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015, and reached 0.63 last year. “As temperatures continue to rise because of climate change, the recent increasing trend is likely to continue,” the researchers wrote. “Local authorities in high-risk areas should consider investing in the expansion of access to hydration centers and public cooling centers or other buildings with air conditioning.”

</p><h3>3. Meta taps geothermal startup to power data centers</h3><p>
	Geothermal startup Sage Geosystems will supply Facebook parent Meta with 150 megawatts of geothermal power in a new deal announced yesterday. The zero-carbon electricity will be used to power Meta’s data centers, starting in 2027, according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240826755596/en/Sage-Geosystems-and-Meta-Announce-Agreement-for-Next-Generation-Geothermal-Power-Generation?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. The facility will be built somewhere “east of the Rocky Mountains.” Earlier this month Sage Geosystems <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240813140415/en/Sage-Geosystems-Inc.-Partners-with-San-Miguel-Electric-Cooperative-Inc.-to-Build-First-Geopressured-Geothermal-System?_hsmi=320234279&utm_content=320234279&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became the first</a> geothermal energy storage project to connect to the grid, storing excess clean energy to be used by Texas’ grid operator. This deal with Meta, however, marks Sage’s first move into actually generating around-the-clock, zero-emission electricity by pumping water into the hot rocks that sit beneath the Earth’s surface to create steam. Another geothermal startup, Fervo Energy, is <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working with Google</a> to power the tech giant’s data centers.
</p><h3>4. Canada hits Chinese EVs with 100% tariffs</h3><p>
	Canada <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trudeau-says-canada-impose-100-tariff-chinese-evs-2024-08-26/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday it will impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs starting October 1 in an effort to prevent cheap cars from flooding the market and threatening Canadian auto manufacturing. New levies might also be applied to other clean technologies, including batteries and solar panels, after a 30-day consultation period. “Actors like China have chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace, compromising the security of our critical industries and displacing dedicated Canadian autos and metal workers,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Last year Canada imported $1.6 billion worth of Chinese EVs, up from just $74 million in 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-26/canada-to-hit-china-with-tariffs-on-electric-vehicles-steel?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. The jump coincided with Tesla’s move to ship Model Y vehicles from Shanghai to the port of Vancouver. But as <em><em>Reuters</em></em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trudeau-says-canada-impose-100-tariff-chinese-evs-2024-08-26/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, “Ottawa is trying to position Canada as a critical part of the global EV supply chain and had come under pressure from domestic industry to act against China.” Canada’s move puts it in alignment with the U.S. and the European Union, which have both taken steps to hike tariffs on Chinese EVs.

	United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned yesterday at the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in Tonga that the “surging seas are coming for us all.” The comments come as two new reports – from the <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-south-west-pacific-2023?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Meteorological Organization</a> and the <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/slr_technical_brief_26_aug_2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.N.</a> – underscore the growing threat of rising seas for coastal communities and low-lying island nations. Oceans have risen by approximately 9 inches since 1880, and the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled over the past 10 years, driven by melting land ice and the expansion of sea water as it warms.
</p><p>
	The Pacific islands are uniquely exposed, the reports say, but the problem is global. Under a scenario in which temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius, by 2050 New York City, Boston, New Orleans, and Atlantic City are all expected to see sea levels rise between 9 and 16 inches. “Across the world, around a billion people live in coastal areas threatened by our swelling ocean,” Guterres said. “Yet even though some sea level rise is inevitable, its scale, pace, and impact are not. That depends on our decisions.”

## It’s back-to-school season … and near triple-digit temps in some places

date: 2024-08-27, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>You may have heard the phrase &#8220;be cool, stay in school&#8221; before. That&#8217;s a bit hard when it&#8217;s this hot out though. More than 10,000 schools nationwide lack air conditioning, according to the Center for Climate Integrity. Installing ACs is costly — but so is heat&#8217;s impact on student learning. Also on the program: We&#8217;ll look at the growing push to erase medical debt, a burden impacting millions of Americans.</p>

## Wild week of US weather includes heat wave, tropical storm, landslide, flash flood and snow

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. — It's been a wild week of weather in many parts of the United States, from heat waves to snowstorms to flash floods.


Here's a look at some of the weather events:


Midwest sizzles under heat wave


Millions of people in the Midwest have been enduring dangerous heat and humidity.


An emergency medicine physician treating Minnesota State Fair-goers for heat illnesses saw firefighters cut rings off two people's swollen fingers Monday in hot weather that combined with humidity made it feel well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).


Soaring late summer temperatures also prompted some Midwestern schools to let out early or cancel sports practices. The National Weather Service issued heat warnings or advisories across Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Oklahoma. Several cities including Chicago opened cooling centers.


Forecasters said Tuesday also will be scorching hot for areas of the Midwest before the heat wave shifts to the south and east.


West Coast mountains get early snowstorm


An unusually cold storm on the mountain peaks along the West Coast late last week brought a hint of winter in August. The system dropped out of the Gulf of Alaska, down through the Pacific Northwest and into California. Mount Rainier, southeast of Seattle, got a high-elevation dusting, as did central Oregon’s Mt. Bachelor resort.




Mount Shasta, the Cascade Range volcano that rises to 14,163 feet (4,317 meters) above far northern California, wore a white blanket after the storm clouds passed. The mountain’s Helen Lake, which sits at 10,400 feet (3,170 meters) received about half a foot of snow (15 centimeters), and there were greater amounts at higher elevations, according to the U.S. Forest Service’s Shasta Ranger Station.


Tropical storm dumps heavy rain on Hawaii


Three tropical cyclones swirled over the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, including Tropical Storm Hone, which brought heavy rain to Hawaii; Hurricane Gilma, which was weakening; and Tropical Storm Hector, which was churning westward, far off the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.




The biggest impacts from Tropical Storm Hone (pronounced hoe-NEH) were rainfall and flash floods that resulted in road closures, downed power lines and damaged trees in some areas of the Big Island, said William Ahue, a forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. No injuries or major damage had been reported, authorities said.


Deadly Alaska landslide crashes into homes


A landslide that cut a path down a steep, thickly forested hillside crashed into several homes in Ketchikan, Alaska, in the latest such disaster to strike the mountainous region. Sunday’s slide killed one person and injured three others and prompted the mandatory evacuation of nearby homes in the city, a popular cruise ship stop along the famed Inside Passage in the southeastern Alaska panhandle.




The slide area remained unstable Monday, and authorities said that state and local geologists were arriving to assess the area for potential secondary slides. Last November, six people — including a family of five — were killed when a landslide destroyed two homes in Wrangell, north of Ketchikan.


Flash flood hits Grand Canyon National Park


The body of an Arizona woman who disappeared in Grand Canyon National Park after a flash flood was recovered Sunday, park rangers said. The body of Chenoa Nickerson, 33, was discovered by a group rafting down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, the park said in a statement.


Nickerson was hiking along Havasu Creek about a half-mile (800 meters) from where it meets up with the Colorado River when the flash flood struck. Nickerson’s husband was among the more than 100 people safely evacuated.




The flood trapped several hikers in the area above and below Beaver Falls, one of a series of usually blue-green waterfalls that draw tourists from around the world to the Havasupai Tribe’s reservation. The area is prone to flooding that turns its iconic waterfalls chocolate brown.

## Canada to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs

date: 2024-08-27, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Following the lead of the U.S. and the European Union, Canada says it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum from China. Plus, it’s estimated that there will be 350 million adults over 60 in India by 2050; so it’s no surprise that companies are increasingly looking to cash in on the silver economy’s substantial spending power.</p>

## The elusive dream of cloud portability: Why migrating workloads isn't so simple

<h4>Despite early promises, moving between providers remains a complex and costly endeavor</h4> <p><strong>Analysis</strong>  One of the promises of the public cloud was that customers would be able to migrate workloads if they wished, taking advantage of market freedom to switch to a different provider if it offered lower costs or some other advantage.

## How de-Googled is Lineage OS?

date: 2024-08-27, from: OS News

On the whole, I’m satisfied that Lineage OS, as I use it, is preventing nearly all of Google’s data collection. I don’t install or use any Google services, I don’t enable A-GPS, I don’t use Chromium or the built-in browser. I could eliminate more arcane aspects of data collection – like the Internet connectivity check – if I wanted to take the trouble. I don’t think that taking reasonable precautions to avoid becoming part of Google’s data collection economy makes me a tinfoil-hatter. Nevertheless, I would probably use GrapheneOS instead, if I had devices that supported it. Ironically, if I wanted to use GrapheneOS, I’d have to buy Google-branded mobile devices, which is an irony that really stings. ↫ Kevin Boone The existence of Android versions like LineageOS, GrapheneOS, /e/OS, and similar, other de-Googled mobile operating systems is absolutely vital. The market is dominated by Google Android and iOS, and since full alternatives that aren&#8217;t Android or iOS are effectively impossible, de-Googled Android is the best we&#8217;re going to get. Regulators must ensure that banks, government ID applications, popular messaging platforms, and similarly crucial applications work 100% reliably on de-Googled Android, and do not require Google Play Services in any way, shape, or form. In The Netherlands, there are basically three banks that control the market, and there&#8217;s really just one messaging application that rules the country &#8211; WhatsApp &#8211; and their use is effectively required to participate in society. Consequently, these applications and platforms should be accessible by as many people as possible, and that definitely includes de-Googled Android devices. Being alive should not be taxed by Apple or Google.

## Judge pauses program to offer legal status to spouses of US citizens

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

McALLEN, Texas  — A federal judge in Texas on Monday paused a Biden administration policy that would give spouses of U.S. citizens legal status without having to first leave the country, dealing at least a temporary setback to one of the biggest presidential actions to ease a path to citizenship in years.


The administrative stay issued by U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker comes just days after 16 states, led by Republican attorneys general, challenged the program that could benefit an estimated 500,000 immigrants in the country, plus about 50,000 of their children.


One of the states leading the challenge is Texas, which in the lawsuit claimed the state has had to pay tens of millions of dollars annually from health care to law enforcement because of immigrants living in the state without legal status.


President Joe Biden announced the program in June. The court order, which lasts for two weeks but could be extended, comes one week after the Department of Homeland Security began accepting applications.


"The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to date," Barker wrote.


Barker was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 as a judge in Tyler, Texas, which lies in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a favored venue for advocates pushing conservative arguments.


The judge laid out a timetable that could produce a decision shortly before the presidential election Nov. 5 or before a newly elected president takes office in January. Barker gave both sides until Oct. 10 to file briefs in the case.


The policy offers spouses of U.S. citizens without legal status, who meet certain criteria, a path to citizenship by applying for a green card and staying in the U.S. while undergoing the process. Traditionally, the process could include a yearslong wait outside of the U.S., causing what advocates equate to "family separation."


The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the order.


Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton cheered the order.


"This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for Texas, our country, and the rule of law," Paxton posted on the social media platform X.


Several families were notified of the receipt of their applications, according to attorneys advocating for eligible families who filed a motion to intervene earlier Monday.


"Texas should not be able to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens and their immigrant spouses without confronting their reality," Karen Tumlin, the founder and director of Justice Action Center, said during the press conference before the order was issued.


The coalition of states accused the administration of bypassing Congress for "blatant political purposes."


The program has been particularly contentious in an election year where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty for people who broke the law.


To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security threat or have a disqualifying criminal history and have been married to a citizen by June 17 — the day before the program was announced.


They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application, including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the country.


If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency. During that period, they can get work authorization.


Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen. They can be required to return to their home country — often for years — and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in.

## Army private who fled to North Korea will plead guilty to desertion

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An Army private who fled to North Korea just over a year ago will plead guilty to desertion and four other charges and take responsibility for his conduct, his lawyer said Monday.


Travis King's attorney, Franklin D. Rosenblatt, told The Associated Press that King intends to admit guilt to a total of five military offenses, including desertion and assaulting an officer. Nine other offenses, including possession of sexual images of a child, will be withdrawn and dismissed under the terms of the deal.


King will be given an opportunity at a Sept. 20 hearing at Fort Bliss, Texas, to discuss his actions and explain what he did.


"He wants to take responsibility for the things that he did," Rosenblatt said.


In a separate statement, he added, "Travis is grateful to his friends and family who have supported him, and to all outside his circle who did not pre-judge his case based on the initial allegations."


He declined to comment on a possible sentence that his client might face. Desertion is a serious charge and can result in imprisonment.


The AP reported last month that the two sides were in plea talks.


King bolted across the heavily fortified border from South Korea in July 2023, and became the first American detained in North Korea in nearly five years.


His run into North Korea came soon after he was released from a South Korean prison where he had served nearly two months on assault charges.


About a week after his release from the prison, military officers took him to the airport so he could return to Fort Bliss to face disciplinary action. He was escorted as far as customs, but instead of getting on the plane, he joined a civilian tour of the Korean border village of Panmunjom. He then ran across the border, which is lined with guards and often crowded with tourists.


He was detained by North Korea, but after about two months, Pyongyang abruptly announced that it would expel him. On Sept. 28, he was flown to back to Texas, and has been in custody there.


The U.S. military in October filed a series of charges against King under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including desertion, as well as kicking and punching other officers, unlawfully possessing alcohol, making a false statement and possessing a video of a child engaged in sexual activity. Those allegations date back to July 10, the same day he was released from the prison.

## Trump tries to tie rival Harris to chaotic Afghanistan exit

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used the third anniversary on Monday of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan to try to pin the chaotic pullout on his Democratic rival for the White House, Kamala Harris.


Trump participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the U.S. exit, then later in Detroit blamed Harris, the vice president, and President Joe Biden for what he termed a "catastrophic" withdrawal.


"Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all over the world," Trump said in an address to the National Guard Association of the United States.


It was the latest attempt by Trump and his campaign to raise doubts about Harris' fitness to serve as commander-in-chief as the Nov. 5 election draws near and comes after Harris last week proclaimed herself ready to lead the nation's armed forces.


The U.S. troop pullout and evacuation of U.S. and allied officials, citizens and Afghans at risk of Taliban retribution saw crowds of desperate Afghans trying to enter Kabul airport and men clinging to aircraft as they taxied down runways in August 2021.


An Islamic State suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. servicemembers and more than 150 Afghans outside an airport gate.


Harris' campaign said the fault lay with Trump's tenure as president.


"The Biden-Harris administration inherited a mess from Donald Trump," said Ammar Moussa, a Harris spokesperson. "Trump wants America to forget that he had four years to get out of Afghanistan but failed to do it."


The Biden administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020.


A review released by the U.S. State Department in 2023 found fault with both the Trump and Biden administrations in the run-up to the withdrawal.


In recent weeks, Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, also have sought to turn Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's decades of service into a political vulnerability. Former military service is often a key selling point for candidates in U.S. political campaigns.


The Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his rank in the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. Walz has described himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest noncommissioned officer positions in the Army. While he achieved that rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.


The Harris campaign deleted a reference this month to Walz's rank as a "command sergeant major" on its website. The campaign also now says Walz "misspoke" in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota when he referred to "weapons of war, that I carried in war." Walz was never deployed to a war zone.


Trump, 78, never served in the military. Though he was of draft age during the Vietnam War, he received four student deferments and a health-related one after he received a diagnosis for bone spurs in his feet.


Vance served in the Marine Corps for four years as a combat correspondent and was deployed to Iraq for roughly seven months. His position mainly involved writing reports of military activity for public dissemination and at times interacting with the media.


Harris has not served in the military.


Harris told CNN in 2021 that she was the last person in the room with Biden when he decided to pull U.S. forces from Afghanistan and end America's longest war. She also said that she was comfortable with Biden's decision, but it remains unclear what role she played in the discussion.


Both Biden and Harris released statements marking the anniversary on Monday.


"These 13 devoted patriots represent the best of America, putting our beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe," Harris said.


Asked Monday why Biden and Harris weren’t marking the anniversary of the Abbey Gate attack as Trump did at Arlington National Cemetery, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Trump had been personally invited by the family members and he called it one way to honor the fallen.


“Another way is to continue to work,” Kirby said. “Maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work with might and main every single day to make sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded, not just at Abbey Gate, but over the course of the 20-some odd years that we were in Afghanistan, have the support that they need.”


Also Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Congress will posthumously honor the 13 service members by presenting their families with the Congressional Gold Medal next month. It's the highest civilian award that Congress can bestow.

## Trial opens for man charged with killing 10 people at Colorado supermarket

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

denver — Jury selection began Monday in the long-delayed trial of a man charged with murdering 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in 2021, a case in which the suspect was ruled mentally unfit to face prosecution before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. 


The outcome hinges on whether the defense can convince jurors that Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 25, was so mentally ill at the time of the mass shooting that he failed to comprehend the difference between right and wrong and thus should not be held legally responsible for the killings. 


The basic facts of the case are not in dispute. Alissa stormed a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Denver, on March 22, 2021, armed with a legally purchased Ruger AR-556 pistol, which resembles an AR-15-style rifle. 


Police say he killed two people in the store's parking lot before shooting eight others to death inside the supermarket. Among those killed was a police officer responding to the scene. 


The shooting spree ended when a police officer shot Alissa in the leg, leading the gunman, wearing only his underwear, to surrender. He has remained in custody since the day of the shooting. 


Alissa is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, in addition to dozens of counts of attempted murder, assault and weapons offenses stemming from the incident. 


A conviction would carry an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. There is no death penalty in Colorado. 


The trial officially got under way on Monday morning with the judge and attorneys for both sides beginning the process of choosing jurors to hear the case, a court spokesperson said.  


Jury selection is expected to wrap up by week's end, with opening statements possible as early as Friday, or on Tuesday following the U.S. Labor Day holiday.  


The case against Alissa stalled after he underwent a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in late 2021. Boulder District Judge Ingrid Bakke, relying on the conclusions of state psychologists, then deemed him incompetent to stand trial. 


In November 2023, Bakke found that the defendant's mental condition had improved sufficiently under psychiatric treatment to rule him restored to competency, allowing the prosecution to move forward. 


Competence is a legal determination that weighs whether criminal defendants understand the charges against them and can meaningfully assist in their own defense. An insanity plea relates instead to the defendant's mental status at the time of the alleged crime. 


Grim details of the killings emerged during his plea hearing last year, when a Boulder homicide detective testified that Alissa shot one man in the back, then pursued the victim as he tried to crawl away and shot him again, killing him. The detective also testified the suspect shot and wounded a woman, then fired multiple additional rounds at her as she curled up in a fetal position, killing her. 


All the victims struck by gunfire died of their wounds, authorities said. 


A precise motive for the killings has not been suggested by prosecutors, though according to a psychologist who treated the gunman at a state mental hospital, Alissa had said he wanted to "commit suicide by cop."

## Social platform X edits AI chatbot after election officials warn that it spreads misinformation

date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA

chicago  — The social media platform X has made a change to its AIchatbot after five secretaries of state warned it was spreading election misinformation.


Top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington sent a letter this month to Elon Musk complaining that the platform’s AI chatbot, Grok, produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.


The secretaries of state requested that the chatbot instead direct users who ask election-related questions to CanIVote.org, a voting information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of State.


Before listing responses to election-related questions, the chatbot now says, “For accurate and up-to-date information about the 2024 U.S. Elections, please visit Vote.gov.”


Both websites are “trustworthy resources that can connect voters with their local election officials,” the five secretaries of state said in a shared statement.


“We appreciate X’s action to improve their platform and hope they continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election year,” they said.


Grok is available only to subscribers of the premium versions of X. But the five secretaries of state who signed the letter said election misinformation from Grok has been shared across multiple social media platforms, reaching millions of people. Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said. The platform did not respond to a request for comment.


The change promoting a link to an official voting website does not seem to address Grok’s ability to create misleading AI-generated images related to elections. People have been using the tool to flood the platform with fake images of candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.


Grok debuted last year for X premium and premium plus subscribers and was touted by Musk as a “rebellious” AI chatbot that will answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.”


Social media platforms have faced mounting scrutiny for their role in spreading misinformation, including about elections. The letter also warned that inaccuracies are to be expected for AI products, especially chatbots such as Grok that are based on large language models.


Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it to X, watchdog groups have raised concerns over a surge in hate speech and misinformation being amplified on the platform, as well as cuts to the staff that had been moderating content.


Experts say the moves represent a regression from progress made by social media platforms attempting to better combat political disinformation after the 2016 U.S. presidential contest and could precipitate a worsening misinformation landscape ahead of this year’s November elections.

## Samsung will provide seven years of free Tizen OS upgrades for its AI TVs

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

If you are looking to upgrade your TV and want a long-lasting option, you may consider getting a Samsung AI TV powered by Tizen OS. The reason is that Samsung announced plans to offer seven years of Tizen OS upgrades for some of its Smart TVs. ↫ Sagar Naresh Bhavsar at Neowin Since buying a dumb TV is no longer possible, you might as well get the one with the longest possible support lifecycle. This new policy covers Samsung TVs from 2024 onward, as well as a few modls from 2023.

## Olivetti Programma 101: at the origins of the personal computer

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

Due to its limited RAM of 1,920 bits, the Programma 101 was mostly a machine conceived to make arithmetic calculations – sums, subtractions, divisions, multiplications, square roots -, yet, like modern computers, it could also perform logical operations, conditional and unconditional jumps, and print the data stored in a register, all through a custom-made alphanumeric programming language. This was, in the early ’60s, what set computers apart from calculators, indeed. Overall, in today’s terms, Programma 101 can be considered a sort of “transitional fossil” between desktop calculators and personal computers. ↫ Riccardo Bianchini Olivetti sure is a name that carries an exceptional amount of weight in the retrocomputing world, as classic Olivetti computers, even standard Olivetti PCs, tend to be highly desirable. A Programma 101 in amazing condition is currently for sale on eBay for a massive €20000, and while there&#8217;s quite a few relatively cheap &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s Olivetti PCs for sale, a sizable number of them are far more desirable and carry massive premiums for their unique design. It&#8217;s sad how many once great and influential computer makers have been relegated to the dustbin of history, outcompeted, acquired, or run into the ground. Some of these once great brands live on as mere badges on electronic junk, and Olivetti, too, was not spared this fate. In fact, what is generally considered the worst PDA ever made, the Olivetti daVinci, was a generic product that just had an Olivetti logo slapped onto it. I have one in-box, and intend to one day write about it, because its awfulness needs to be shared with the world.

## Special counsel asks court to revive charges against Trump in documents case

date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith on Monday asked a federal appeals court to revive the criminal case accusing Donald Trump of retaining classified documents, after a lower court dismissed the indictment in July, according to a court filing.


In their brief, Smith and his team of attorneys urged the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to overturn the July 15 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon in which she concluded that Smith was unlawfully appointed and did not have the legal authority to bring the case.


"Congress has bestowed on the Attorney General, like the heads of many Executive Departments, broad authority to structure the agency he leads to carry out the responsibilities imposed on him by law," they wrote.


"The district court's contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the Attorney General has such authority, and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government."


The Justice Department had previously said it planned to appeal the ruling.


In Monday's brief, Smith's office also asked the appellate court to schedule oral arguments.


Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, found that Attorney General Merrick Garland's decision to appoint Smith in 2022 violated the U.S. Constitution. She also found that his budget, which is funded through an indefinite appropriation, was unlawful.




Trump's lawyers had previously challenged the legal authority for Smith's appointment, arguing that Smith's office was not created by Congress and the special counsel was not confirmed by the Senate.


Trump's campaign said on Monday that the court should reject Smith's request and that other cases facing the former president should be dismissed.


“Not only should the dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida be affirmed but be immediately joined by a dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts. The Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Comrade Kamala’s Political Opponent, President Trump. Let us come together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.


Cannon's ruling has faced staunch criticism, with many attorneys saying it flies in the face of prior court decisions which all upheld the legality of the rules that the Justice Department has relied on for years in appointing special counsels.


"The Attorney General validly appointed the Special Counsel, who is also properly funded," Smith's office wrote, adding that Cannon had "deviated from binding Supreme Court precedent" and also "misconstrued the statutes that authorized the Special Counsel's appointment."


Cannon's decision to dismiss the case marked a legal victory for Trump and came not long after the Supreme Court ruled that he had broad criminal immunity from prosecution for official actions he took during his time in office.


That Supreme Court decision has led to major delays in Smith's second criminal case against Trump, in which Trump is facing charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.


Smith faces a Friday deadline to tell the judge overseeing the election subversion case how he wishes to proceed in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.


Trump, who is running in the 2024 presidential election against Vice President Kamala Harris, was convicted in May on New York state charges involving hush money paid to an adult film star to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 election.


His sentencing has been postponed following the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity.


In the documents case, Trump was indicted on charges that he willfully retained sensitive national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructed government efforts to retrieve the material.

## Apparent cyberattack leaves Seattle airport facing major internet outages

date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA

seattle — An apparent cyberattack disrupted internet, phones, email and other systems at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for a third day on Monday as Port of Seattle officials worked to investigate the outages and restore full service.


"We're working around the clock to get necessary systems back online and to mitigate impacts to our passengers," the airport's aviation managing director Lance Lyttle said in a press conference Sunday.


Lyttle said the airport is investigating with the help of outside experts and is working closely with federal partners, including the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection. Officials have not released details about the full scope of the outage, but Lyttle said it was not affecting TSA's ability to screen passengers.


Some airlines, including Delta and Alaska, reported no service interruptions from the outage. Both airlines use Sea-Tac as a hub. Still, the outage did affect the Port of Seattle's baggage sorting system, prompting airlines to warn passengers to avoid checking bags if possible to avoid potential delays.


The airport also warned travelers to allow extra time at the airport and to use airline mobile applications to get boarding passes and bag tags when possible.


Still, many travelers faced security lines that were longer than normal and long waits at baggage claims and checking. Terminal screens were also out throughout the airport, making it difficult for some to determine their assigned gate.


"Port teams continue to make progress on returning systems to normal operations, but there is not an estimated time for return," the airport wrote on Facebook on Sunday.

## Large Landowners Are By Far the Most Likely to Speak Out Against Clean Energy

date: 2024-08-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU1MzEyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MjE2OTY4MH0.SxbqEy7FDRmTCM_9EVMcdOow01kjtKjOvj4oxyqa7Oo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Attending a public hearing is the most important civic duty that nobody actually does. (Well, not nobody — we’ll get into that.) But despite attendance at public hearings being one of the most effective ways to <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-make-effective-public-comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly shape</u></a> one’s community, the average American probably isn’t going. And heaven forbid you ask them to <em><em>speak</em></em>.</p><p>Heatmap’s latest <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_blank">poll</a> looked into, among other things, the actions someone would take if they had concerns about a hypothetical clean energy project in their area. What we learned is that Americans are more willing to <em><em>join a lawsuit</em></em> (41%) than they are to talk at a public hearing (30%). But there <em><em>is </em></em>a demographic that is bolder than the rest of us glossophobes — people who owned 50 or more acres of land were nearly one-and-a-half times as likely (43%) to speak up in such a scenario. Overall, these large landowners were also more likely to say they’d attend a public hearing about a clean energy project (71%) than the general population (60%).</p><p>Community opposition is one of the leading causes of delays and cancellations of renewable projects, with about one-third of wind and solar siting applications in the last five years <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>killed by local pushback</u></a>. It’s also true that Republicans are more likely to live in rural areas with renewable energy development, meaning “conservatives’ opposition could prove more decisive to the future of wind and solar than liberals’ support,” <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/renewable-energy-land-use-wind-solar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote last year</u></a>. (Heatmap’s polling backs that up: 70% of the large landowners we surveyed said they plan to vote for Donald Trump, compared to 17% who said they intend to vote for Kamala Harris.)</p><p>Clean-energy advocates who work with rural partners, including large landowners, told me they weren’t surprised to hear of the group’s high levels of in-person engagement. “Obviously, it takes land to build wind and solar, and a lot of that land is in rural America,” Jane Kleeb, the founder and director of <a href="https://boldalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bold Alliance</u></a>, an environmental advocacy organization based out of Nebraska that helps landowners navigate new infrastructure projects, told me. </p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest concern Heatmap encountered among large landowners was that potential clean-energy projects could “take up farmland” (70%), followed by worries that they’d “harm wildlife or local nature/environmental sites” (58%; this is also the highest concern among the general population, cited by 54% of all respondents). </p><p>Kleeb said she often encounters these anxieties when working with partners in rural states. “When we’re talking with a community that for decades has supported land being used to grow ethanol, which is also an energy source — solar will take much less land <em><em>and</em></em> not use water, which is a depleting resource in the Midwest and all across the country,” she pointed out. (To be clear, Bold Alliance does support ethanol.) As for environmental concerns, “wind and solar have way less impact than fossil fuels on wildlife, period,” Kleeb said. “There’s no comparison. It’s not even a close call.”</p><p>Another worry large landowners had that stood out from the general population was that nearby land might be developed “by non-local companies” (57% of large landowners vs. 37% of the general population). “What’s not been happening well is that some clean-energy companies will come into a community, and they won’t disclose where the projects are going,” Kleeb said, adding that “community after community that we’re engaging with wants to know that from the beginning, and they want to be engaged in the discussions about where a project may or may not be better suited to be placed.”</p><p>While Heatmap specifically looked at who would be the most likely to speak out at a public hearing if they had <em><em>concerns </em></em>about a clean-energy project in their area, Kyle Unruh, the Idaho and Montana policy manager for Renewable Northwest, which works with regional partners to create a cleaner grid, said he’s seen that landowners will also “advocate for development on either their own land — as a means of making feasible the continued ownership of a small farm — or on behalf of a fellow landowner who should be entitled to their own property rights and decisions about what happens on their private land.” </p><p>At the same time, Unruh has seen landowners testify that they believe development on a nearby property could hurt their property values — a concern raised by 45% of the large landowners who responded to Heatmap’s survey — though he stressed that the claim that renewable energy development decreases nearby property values “is <a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2023/08/Solar-and-Property-Values-Fact-Sheet_0823.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not borne out</u></a> by <a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/property-values" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the research</u></a>.” He cited this worry as another reason large landowners evidently show up and speak out at public hearings more than their suburban and urban neighbors. “Landowners tend to have an elevated personal interest in whether energy development takes place, given this development has the real potential to increase the value of their land or the perceived effect of reducing the value or desirability of their land,” he told me.</p><p>On the flip side, when Heatmap presented landowners with reasons why they might <em><em>allow</em></em> renewable projects to be developed on their land, people living on six or more acres were more likely to pick “none of the above” (44%) in Heatmap’s polling than tax benefits (29%), diversifying their income (28%), or starting an agrivoltaics venture with solar generation and agriculture co-located on the same property (20%), among other options. Of potential upsides“having a long-term source of income” (35%) had the plurality, and “environmental benefits” (31%) also held high appeal.</p><p>Clean-energy developers should be making a concerted effort to reach out to large landowners from the start, but not just because they’re one of the more vocal contingents at the local town hall. More often than not, the energy transition will take place in literal backyards, and many <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-brownfield" target="_self"><u>opportunities</u></a> for <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/swiss-re-natural-catastrophe-insurance#:~:text=Ohio%20has%20approved%20the%20Oak%20Run%20Solar%20Project%2C%20a%206%2C000%2Dacre%20solar%20farm%20in%20Madison%20County%20that%20will%20also%20graze%201%2C000%20sheep%20and%20grow%20crops.%20The%20farm%20will%20be%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s%20largest%20%E2%80%9Cagrivoltaics%E2%80%9D%20project." target="_self"><u>collaboration</u></a> or partnership are lost when misinformation, conspiracies, or sneaky development tactics lead instead.</p><p>“The climate movement, in general over the past decade, has missed the boat here,” Kleeb of Bold Alliance told me. “There’s a major opportunity to engage with the rural folks who will be shouldering the responsibility of making sure that wind and solar are being built.”</p><p><em>The Heatmap poll of 5,202 American adults was conducted by Embold Research via online responses from August 3 to 16, 2024. The survey included interviews with Americans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.</em></p>

By Rick Smith On Aug. 26, 1999, NASA’s Chandra&#160;X-ray Observatory opened its powerful telescopic eye in orbit and captured its awe-inspiring “first light” images of Cassiopeia A, a supernova remnant roughly 11,000 light-years from Earth. That first observation was far more detailed than anything seen by previous X-ray telescopes, even revealing – for the first [&#8230;]

## School Is Back in Session, But Summer’s Not Over Yet

date: 2024-08-26, from: Heatmap News

	This week’s weather forecast is like the Uno reverse card: Texas might finally get a break from triple-digit temperatures, but the summer heat is making its way back into the Northeast.
</p><h3>After some taste of fall, summer returns to the north </h3><p>
	Those west of the Appalachians might have already started to feel a shift in the air this weekend. After a week of below-average temperatures and fall-like weather, 
	<strong>heat maps for the Northeast have gone back to looking very red.</strong> Temperatures could run 5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit above average this week, Paul Pastelok, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told me. <strong>“Highs will be the low to mid 80s, nights in the upper 50s to lower 60s,”</strong> he said.
</p><p>
	Philadelphia, which has already started to get warmer, might see even higher temperatures, with some days later in the week hitting the low 90s. But for those in the state hoping to make the most of the heat by turning it into a beach vacation, I am sorry to say this week will likely be cloudy from beginning to end.
</p><p>
	New England will also see the return of some warmth this week, but it’ll be “slower and less impressive” than other nearby states, according to Pastelok. Temperatures there will be closer to average, and will very soon cool back down.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Split Bars" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="371" id="datawrapper-chart-Xs8fj" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xs8fj/2/" style="border: none;" title="Uncommonly Hot Weather We’re Having" width="680"></iframe></center><h3>A cold front is finally in store for Texas </h3><p>
	This summer hasn’t been fun for Texas. The unrelenting heat — more intense there than in any other state — has shattered multiple temperature records, increased wildfire activity, and contributed to severe drought. Just last week, when most of the country got a taste of cooler days ahead, the Texas energy grid 
	<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/texas-heat-wave-deadly-record-breaking-drought-b2600257.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broke</u></a> its demand record. While it’s still too soon to call off the season of scorching temperatures, the new week brings some good news.
</p><p>
<strong>A strong cold front will bring temperatures down below average across northern Texas later this week.</strong> Some precipitation in South Texas could pull readings a few degrees lower still, Pastelok told me, even though humidity is expected to remain high. Central Texas has already started to get some relief, finally dropping out of the triple digits this past weekend.
</p><h3>Heat to intensify in the West </h3><p>
<strong>Those in the Midwest will have to bear through an increase in temperatures this week.</strong> The Great Plains, the Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes can all expect temperatures in the high 80s and mid 90s, Pastelok told me. <strong>The heat won’t last long, though.</strong> Starting Thursday, a cold front will start moving through the region, and temperatures are expected to drop well below average across the Plains and the Midwest for at least a few days.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Back to School:</strong> This quick but intense heat wave is making its way across the Midwest right in time for back to school season. Chicago Public Schools went back into session today with a series of <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/chicago-public-schools-to-begin-classes-amid-heat-wave/3531626/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat adaptations</u></a> in place — athletic games have been canceled until Wednesday and outdoor practices were moved indoors. While in Chicago all classrooms are equipped with air conditioning, that is not true across all of the region. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/school-temperatures-heat-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Washington Post</em></em></u></a>, as heat waves become more constant in the North, almost 14,000 public schools that did not need AC back in 1970 need it today. </li>
</ul><p>
<strong>In California, the week will be hot and wet.</strong> After a series of storms pass through the state earlier this week, temperatures will go back to rising. “The Central Valleys of California by late next week will be well above average, along with the Desert Southwest,” Pastelok told me. Cities such as Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno, can see temperatures above 100 degrees.
</p><h3>Fall will be toasty </h3><p>
	According to the National Weather Service’s forecast, 
	<strong>the entire country will experience above average fall temperatures this year.</strong> Seriously, I mean the <em><em>entire</em></em> country. The hardest hit states will be New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and then over on the top of the Northeast, from Maine to New York.
</p><p>
	According to AccuWeather 
	<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/fall-forecast-warm-autumn-to-fuel-second-summer-across-most-of-the-us/1672230" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecasts</u></a>, for many, fall will feel more like a “second summer” than a new season. In fact, only two states — Washington and Oregon — will see a quick transition into fall. The rest of the country is, well, doomed.
</p><p>
	Not only will fall be hotter, it will also be dryer, raising concerns over increased wildfire risk across California, parts of the Great Lakes and the Northeast. Severe weather, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, will also <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-dnc-speech#:~:text=2.%20Hurricane%20forecasters%20warn%20of%20%E2%80%98supercharged%20September%E2%80%99" target="_blank">define the season</a>. AccuWeather has predicted six to 10 storms to hit the country from this week through the end of September alone.
</p><p>
	For snow lovers such as myself, it seems like flakes might not make an appearance until November, and only in some of the coldest spots in the northern Plains, Rockies, and Upper Midwest.

## Microsoft is bringing annoying Windows 11 Start menu ads to Windows 10

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced a so-called &#8220;Account Manager&#8221; for Windows 11 that appears on the screen when you click your profile picture on the Start menu. Instead of just showing you buttons for logging out, locking your device or switching profiles, it displays Microsoft 365 ads. All the actually useful buttons are now hidden behind a three-dot submenu (apparently, my 43-inch display does not have enough space to accommodate them). Now, the &#8220;Account Manager&#8221; is coming to Windows 10 users. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Yes, this is a really small ad int he grand scheme of things, but the mere concept of my operating system showing me all kinds of ads and upsells, as both Windows and macOS have been doing aggressively for years now, is so deeply offensive to me. It shows such utter disrespect to me as a user, and shows that Microsoft and Apple see me not as an end user, but as a ripe plum ready to be bled dry at every turn. It&#8217;s revolting. As the latest release, Windows 11 has always been the most ad-ridden of the Windows releases still in use, but it seems Windows users can&#8217;t escape the onslaught either. I&#8217;m especially expecting ever more aggressive ads and upsells for Windows 11 to appear in Windows 10 now that the 2025 cutoff date for Windows 10 support is nearing, of course appearing at the most inopportune times &#8211; because everybody loves a giant fullscreen ad on your operating system when you&#8217;re trying to give a presentation or meet that tight deadline you forced yourself yo stress about by playing a bit too much League of Legends. If you want an ad- and upsell-free operating system, your options are legion &#8211; there&#8217;s countless Linux distributions and the various BSDs to choose from.

## No unmodified files remain from original import of OpenBSD

date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News

The greek quiz is so obscure that it is ridiculous &#8212; noone can play this. Replace it with a new quiz about galley (ship) parts. This commit changes the LAST UNMODIFIED ORIGINAL FILE (meaning revision 1.1.1.1) from the original import that created OpenBSD on Oct 18, 1995. With this commit, we have completed an amusing mission of replacing the final parts of the original OpenBSD. We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus. ↫ Theo de Raadt With this change to a quiz game in OpenBSD, every single file of the OpenBSD code base is newer than that first, original import. Now I&#8217;m curious to see which other projects have achieved this milestone, and when.

It got called the crisis in cosmology. But now astronomers can explain some surprising recent discoveries. When astronomers got their first glimpses of galaxies in the early universe from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, they were expecting to find galactic pipsqueaks, but instead they found what appeared to be a bevy of Olympic bodybuilders.

The plant itself was not affected, according to the Normal Fire Department, and no one was injured. The source of the blaze is under investigation. Rivian’s Normal factory produces all of the EV company’s current models. Last week Rivian got the city’s approval to expand the plant by about 1.3 million square feet to manufacture the upcoming mass-market R2 SUV. EVs catch fire less often than gas-powered cars, but they burn hotter and are harder to put out once alight.</p><h3>2. Fauci recovering from West Nile infection</h3><p><strong></strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is recovering from West Nile Virus, a spokeswoman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/fauci-west-nile-virus-hospitalized.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" target="_blank">said</a>. Fauci was hospitalized with fever, chills, and fatigue but is now at home and is expected to make a full recovery. According to Dr. Jonathan LaPook, the chief medical correspondent for CBS News, Fauci thinks he was infected after being bitten by a mosquito in his backyard. West Nile is the most common mosquito-borne disease in the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far this year 216 cases have been confirmed. About one in five infected people develop symptoms. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-west-nile-virus?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lPJUwrMRFYzUXqVg3Qg5cPsRgbVG8TpjS6JFz3AK30uV51OCYrHQJOsyYs953xypO3EWH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> the Environmental Protection Agency, climate change is one of many factors that increase the risk of human exposure to West Nile by accelerating mosquito development, biting rates, and disease incubation.</p><h3>3.

The number of models on sale in the U.S. has nearly doubled over the last five years, to 47, and sales were up 60% in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024. While conventional hybrids come with a small battery and motor that helps power the car’s engine to reduce fuel use, plug-in hybrids have a bigger battery that’s strong enough to run the vehicle exclusively on electricity for a little while before the gas engine takes over. The recent rise in sales is attributed in part to automakers being forced to comply with new tailpipe emissions rules, and drivers being EV curious but not quite ready to abandon gas entirely. “Plug-in hybrids balance the need to reduce vehicle emissions and offer consumers an entry point to electrified vehicles,” a Stellantis spokesperson told the <em><em>Journal</em></em>. GM is bringing back plug-in hybrids in 2027 after axing the Chevrolet Volt. Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford are all either considering rolling out a plug-in hybrid in the U.S. or expanding existing lineups.</p><h3>4.

Promethean Particles produces metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are “composed of metal ions interconnected by organic molecules to form a porous, lattice-like structure.” These nanoparticles have huge surface area, and the size of their pores can be customized to trap different gases and liquids. So the technology is being eyed as an option for capturing carbon at source for storage and transport, but like many CCS technologies, it is very expensive.

## Alaska landslide kills 1,injures 3 in Ketchikan, authorities say

date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA

ANCHORAGE, Alaska  — One person was killed and three were injured by a landslide that prompted a mandatory evacuation in the Alaska city of Ketchikan, authorities said.


Three people were transported to Ketchikan Medical Center following the landslide, which struck around 4 p.m. Sunday and damaged homes and infrastructure, the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and City of Ketchikan said in a joint statement Sunday.


Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared an emergency for Ketchikan, while Borough Mayor Rodney Dial and city Mayor Dave Kiffer issued a separate emergency declaration.


"Friends, is with a heavy heart we relay that a landslide in the city has taken a life, caused several injuries, damaged homes and impacted our community," Dial said in the statement.


Kiffer said the loss of life was "heartbreaking, and my heart goes out to those who lost their homes."


"In my 65 years in Ketchikan, I have never seen a slide of this magnitude. With the slides we have seen across the region, there is clearly a region-wide issue that we need to try to understand with the support of our State geologist," Kiffer said.


Two of the victims were admitted to the hospital and one was treated and released. All other individuals have been accounted for, the statement said.


Multiple homes were impacted by the landslide and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for residents of Third Avenue and nearby streets, while a shelter was set up at Ketchikan High School, the borough and city said.


A potential secondary landslide area was identified to the south of the original slide location and crews were standing by, the statement said.
