## Decision on major policy shift on marijuana won't come until after US presidential election

date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A decision on whether to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug in the U.S. won't come until after the November presidential election, a timeline that raises the chances it could be a potent political issue in the closely contested race.


The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration last week set a hearing date to take comment on the proposed historic change in federal drug policy for Dec. 2.


The hearing date means a final decision could well come in the next administration. While it's possible it could precede the end of President Joe Biden's term, issuing it before Inauguration Day “would be pretty expedited,” said cannabis lawyer Brian Vicente.


That could put a new spotlight on the presidential candidates' positions on marijuana. Vice President Kamala Harris has backed decriminalizing the drug and said it's “absurd” to have it in the DEA's Schedule I category alongside heroin and LSD. The Democratic nominee's position has shifted over the years; she once oversaw the enforcement of cannabis laws and opposed legalized recreational use for adults in California while running for attorney general in 2010.


Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, signaled support for a Florida legalization measure on Saturday, following earlier comments that he increasingly agrees that people shouldn't be jailed for the drug now legal in multiple states, “whether that's a good thing or a bad thing."


During his run for president in 2016, Trump said that he backed medical marijuana and that pot should be left up to the states. But during his first term, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the pot trade in states where the drug is legal.


Trump's campaign didn't immediately respond to a query about his position on rescheduling the drug.


The Justice Department proposed reclassifying it in May, saying the change would recognize marijuana’s medical uses and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation’s most dangerous drugs. The proposal, which would not legalize marijuana for recreational use, came after a call for review from Biden, who has called the change “monumental.”


The DEA has said it doesn’t yet have a position on whether to go through with the change, stating in a memo that it would keep weighing the issue as the federal rulemaking process plays out.


The new classification would be the most significant shift in U.S. drug policy in 50 years and could be a potent political issue, especially with younger voters. But it faces opposition from groups such as Smart Approaches to Marijuana.


Its president, Kevin Sabet, argues there isn't enough data to move cannabis to the less-dangerous Schedule III category, alongside ketamine and some anabolic steroids. The DEA's move to hold the hearing is “a huge win in our fight to have this decision guided by medical science, not politics,” he said in a statement, adding that 18 states' attorneys general are backing his opposition.


The hearing sparked some consternation among pot industry players, though little surprise about the DEA decision to hold one.


“While the result ultimately may be better, I think we’re so used to seeing delays that it’s just a little disappointing,” said Stephen Abraham, chief financial officer at The Blinc Group, supplier of cartridges and other hardware used in pot vapes. “Every time you slow down or hold resources from the legal market, it’s to the benefit of the illicit market.”


The proposal, which was signed by Attorney General Merrick Garland rather than DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, followed a recommendation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.


Federal drug policy has lagged behind that of many states in recent years, with 38 having already legalized medical marijuana and 24 legalizing its recreational use.


Lawmakers from both major political parties have pushed for the change as marijuana has become increasingly decriminalized and accepted. A Gallup poll last year found 70% of adults support legalization, the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the roughly three in 10 who backed it in 2000.


The marijuana industry has also grown quickly, and state-licensed pot companies are keen on rescheduling partly because it could enable them to take federal business-expense tax deductions that aren’t available to enterprises involved in “trafficking” any Schedule I or II drug. For some of Vicente's clients, the change would effectively reduce the tax rate from 75% to 25%.


Some legalization advocates also hope rescheduling could help persuade Congress to pass legislation aimed at opening banks’ doors to cannabis companies. Currently, the drug's legal status means many federally regulated banks are reluctant to lend to such businesses, or sometimes even provide checking or other basic services.


Rescheduling could also make it easier to research marijuana, since it’s difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I substances. Some medical marijuana patient advocates fear that the discussion has already become deeply politicized and that the focus on rescheduling's potential effect on the industry has shifted attention from the people who could benefit.


“It was our hope that we could finally take the next step and create the national medical cannabis program that we need," said Steph Sherer, founder and president of Americans for Safe Access. The organization advocates for putting cannabis in a drug category all its own and for creating a medical cannabis office within DHS.


The immediate effect of rescheduling on the nation’s criminal justice system, though, would likely be more muted, since federal prosecutions for simple possession have been fairly rare in recent years.

## Party of one: Restaurants cater to growing number of solo diners

date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Parisa Imanirad, a scientist and cancer researcher from San Francisco, is married and has a wide circle of friends. But once or twice a week, she goes to a restaurant by herself.


Imanirad said dining alone gives her time to think or read. She tries not to touch her phone and relishes the silence. “It’s like a spa, but a different type,” Imanirad said during a recent solo lunch at Spruce, an upscale restaurant in San Francisco.


Imanirad isn’t alone in her desire to be alone. In the United States, solo dining reservations have risen 29% over the last two years, according to OpenTable, the restaurant reservation site. They’re up 18% this year in Germany and 14% in the United Kingdom.


Japan even has a special term for solo dining: “ohitorisama,” which means “alone” but with honorifics spoken before and after the word to make parties of one feel less hesitant. In a recent survey, Japan’s Hot Pepper Gourmet Eating Out Research Institute found that 23% of Japanese people eat out alone, up from 18% in 2018.


As a result, many restaurants in Japan and elsewhere are redoing their seating, changing their menus and adding other special touches to appeal to solo diners.


“Even so-called family restaurants are increasing counter seats for solitary diners, and restaurants are offering courses with smaller servings so a person eating alone gets a variety of dishes,” said Masahiro Inagaki, a senior researcher at the institute.


OpenTable CEO Debby Soo thinks remote work is one reason for the increase, with diners seeking respites from their home offices. But she thinks there are deeper reasons, too.


“I think there’s a broader movement of self-love and self-care and really … enjoying your own company,” Soo said.


The pandemic also made social interactions less feasible and therefore less important while eating out, said Anna Mattila, a professor of lodging management at Penn State University who has studied solo dining. And smartphones help some restaurant patrons feel connected to others even when they’re by themselves, she said.


“The social norms have changed. People don’t look at solo diners anymore and think, ‘You must be a loner,’” Mattila said.


More people live and travel solo


The growth comes as more people are living alone. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found that 38% of U.S. adults ages 25 to 54 were living without a partner, up from 29% in 1990. In Japan, single households now make up one-third of the total; that’s expected to climb to 40% by 2040, according to government data.


Increasing interest in solo travel — particularly among travelers ages 55 and over — is also leading to more meals alone.


On a recent solo trip to Lucerne, Switzerland, Carolyn Ray was stunned when the hostess led her to a beautiful lake-view table set for one, complete with a small vase of flowers. Ray, the CEO and editor of JourneyWoman, a website for solo women travelers over 50, said other restaurants have tried to seat her toward the back or pointedly asked if someone will be joining her.


Ray counsels women planning to dine alone to go somewhere else if they’re treated rudely or given a bad table.


“It’s almost like the world hasn’t caught up with this idea that we are on our own because we want to be on our own and we’re independent and empowered,” she said. “We can go into any restaurant we want and have a table for one and feel good about it.”


Shawn Singh, a Houston-based content creator and restaurant reviewer, said he eats alone about 70% of the time. If the idea of venturing out for a solitary meal is intimidating, he suggests going to lunch instead of dinner — when tables are usually more crowded with groups — or going early on a weekday.


“The best way to see a restaurant you’ve been wanting to see for a long time is definitely going solo,” Singh said. “If I go at 5 p.m. and alone, I haven’t been denied at one place ever.”


Restaurants aren’t always thrilled to seat a single diner at a table that could fit more. A Michelin-starred London restaurant, Alex Dilling at Hotel Cafe Royal, caused a stir last year when it started charging solo patrons the same price as two customers. Its eight-course dinner tasting menu, which includes caviar and Cornish squid, costs 215 pounds ($280) per person.


The restaurant, which has only 34 seats, didn’t respond to a request for comment. But its website doesn’t allow reservations for fewer than two people.


'Playing the long game'


Other restaurants say it’s worth seating one person at a table made for two because solo diners tend to be loyal, repeat customers.


“While there may be a short-term loss there, I think we’re kind of playing the long game and establishing ourselves as a place that’s truly special,” said Drew Brady, chief operating officer at Overthrow Hospitality, which operates 11 vegan restaurants in New York.


Brady has seen an increase in solo diners since the pandemic, and says they're evenly split between men and women. At the company’s flagship restaurant, Avant Garden, they make up as much as 8% of patrons.


In response, the restaurant teamed up with Lightspeed, a restaurant tech and consulting company, to develop a solo dining program. Avant Garden now has a spacious table designed for solo diners, with a $65 four-course menu fashioned like a passport to enhance the sense of adventure. If solo diners order a cocktail, a bartender mixes it tableside.


Mattila, at Penn State, said restaurants might want to consider additional changes. Her research has found that solo diners prefer angular shapes — in lights, tables or plates, for example — to round ones, which are more associated with the connectedness of groups. They also prefer slow-tempo music.


Jill Weber, the founder of Sojourn Philly, a Philadelphia company that owns two restaurants and a wine bar, said she adds a communal table at special events such as wine tastings so individuals have a place to gather. She also doesn't offer specials designed for two.


Weber, who is also an archaeologist, loves dining alone when she's traveling.


“There’s something about not having to agree on where to go and everything that goes with that. You have the freedom to stay as long as you want, order what you want and sit with those things," she said. “It also feels brave sometimes.”

## US Fed welcomes 'soft landing' even if many Americans don't feel like cheering

date: 2024-09-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — When Jerome Powell delivered a high-profile speech last month, the Federal Reserve chair came the closest he ever had to declaring that the inflation surge that gripped the nation for three painful years was now essentially defeated.


And not only that. The Fed's high interest rates, Powell said, had managed to achieve that goal without causing a widely predicted recession and high unemployment.


Yet most Americans are not in the same celebratory mood about the plummeting of inflation in the face of the high borrowing rates the Fed engineered. Though consumer sentiment is slowly rising, a majority of Americans in some surveys still complain about elevated prices, given that the costs of such necessities as food, gas and housing remain far above where they were before the pandemic erupted in 2020.




The relatively sour mood of the public is creating challenges for Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks to succeed President Joe Biden. Despite the fall of inflation and strong job growth, many voters say they're dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration's economic record — and especially frustrated by high prices.


That disparity points to a striking gap between how economists and policymakers assess the past several years of the economy and how many ordinary Americans do.




In his remarks last month, given at an annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell underscored how the Fed's sharp rate hikes succeeded much more than most economists had predicted in taming inflation without hammering the economy — a notoriously difficult feat known as a “soft landing.”


“Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment,” Powell said.


Ultimately, though, he noted, “the 4-1/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment — a welcome and historically unusual result.”


With high inflation now essentially conquered, Powell and other central bank officials are preparing to cut their key interest rate in mid-September for the first time in more than four years. The Fed is becoming more focused on sustaining the job market with the help of lower interest rates than on continuing to fight inflation.


Many Americans 'have taken a big hit'


Many consumers, by contrast, are still preoccupied most by today's price levels.


“From the viewpoint of economists, central bankers, how we think about inflation, it really has been a remarkable success, how inflation went up, has come back, and is around the target,” said Kristin Forbes, an economist at MIT and a former official at the United Kingdom's central bank, the Bank of England.


“But from the viewpoint of households, it has not been so successful,” she added. “Many have taken a big hit to their wages. Many of them feel like the basket of goods they buy is now much more expensive.”


Two years ago, economists feared that the Fed’s ongoing rate hikes — it ultimately raised its benchmark rate more than 5 percentage points to a 23-year high in the fastest pace in four decades — would hammer the economy and cause millions of job losses. After all, that’s what happened when the Fed under Chair Paul Volcker sent its benchmark rate to nearly 20% in the early 1980s, ultimately throttling a brutal inflationary spell.


In fact, at Jackson Hole two years ago, Powell himself warned that using high interest rates to defeat the inflation spike “would bring some pain to households and businesses.”


Yet now, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation is 2.5%, not far above its 2% target. And while a weaker pace of hiring has caused some concerns, the unemployment rate is at a still-low 4.3%, and the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate last quarter.


While no Fed official will outright declare victory, some take satisfaction in defying the predictions of doom and gloom.


“2023 was a historic year for inflation falling,” said Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed. “And there wasn’t a recession, and that’s unprecedented. And so we will be studying the mechanics of how that happened for a long time.”


Measures of consumer sentiment, though, indicate that three years of hurtful inflation have dimmed many Americans’ outlook. In addition, high loan rates, along with elevated housing prices, have led many young workers to fear that homeownership is increasingly out of reach.


'Inflation overhang' 


Last month, the consulting firm McKinsey said that 53% of consumers in its most recent survey “still say that rising prices and inflation are among their concerns.” McKinsey's analysts attributed the escalated figure to “an ‘inflation overhang." That's the belief among analysts that it can take months, if not years, for consumers to adjust emotionally to a much higher level of prices even if their pay is keeping pace.




Economists point to several reasons for the wide gap in perceptions between economists and policymakers on the one hand and everyday consumers and workers on the other.


The first is that the Fed tailors its interest rate policies to manage inflation — the rate of price changes — rather than price levels themselves. So when inflation spikes, the central bank's goal is to return it to a sustainable level, currently defined as 2%, rather than to reverse the price increases. The Fed's policymakers expect average wages to catch up and eventually to allow consumers to afford the higher prices.


“Central bankers think even if inflation gets away from 2% for a period, as long as it comes back, that’s fine,” Forbes said. "Victory, mission accomplished. But the amount of time inflation is away from 2% can have a major cost.”


Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, a Harvard economist, and two colleagues found that most people's views of inflation are very different from those of economists. Economists in general are more likely to regard inflation as a consequence of strong growth. They often describe inflation as a result of an “overheating” economy: Low unemployment, strong job growth and rising wages lead businesses to sharply increase prices without necessarily losing sales.


By contrast, a survey by Stantcheva found, ordinary Americans “view inflation as an unambiguously bad thing and very rarely as a sign of a good economy or as a byproduct of positive developments.”


Her survey respondents also said they believed that inflation stems from excessive government spending or greedy businesses. They “do not believe that (central bank) policymakers face trade-offs, such as having to reduce economic activity or increase unemployment to control inflation.”


Perceived recession


As a result, few consumers probably worried about the potential for a downturn as a result of the Fed's rate hikes. One opinion survey, in fact, found that many consumers believed, incorrectly, that the economy was in a recession because inflation was so high.


At the Jackson Hole conference, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, argued that central banks cannot guarantee that high inflation will never appear — only that they will try to drive it back down when it does.


“I get this question quite often in Parliament," Bailey said. “People say, ‘Well you failed to control inflation.’ I said no.”


The test of a central bank, he continued, “is not that we will never have inflation. The test of the regime is how well, once you get hit by these shocks, you bring it back to target.”


Still, Forbes suggested that there are lessons to be learned from the post-COVID inflation spike, including whether inflation was allowed to stay too high for too long, both in the U.S. and the U.K. The Fed has long been criticized for having taken too long to start raising its benchmark rate. Inflation first spiked in the spring of 2021. Yet the Fed, under the mistaken impression that high inflation would prove “transitory," didn't begin raising rates until nearly a year later.


“Maybe should we rethink ... where we seem to be now: ‘As long as it comes back four to five years later, that’s fine,’ ” she said. “Maybe four to five years is too long.


"How much unemployment or slowdown in growth should we be willing to accept to shorten the length of time that inflation is too high?”

	5. The first-drive reviews of Volvo’s EX90 SUV are in
</h3><p>
	Today seems to be the day everyone is publishing their first-drive reviews of the Volvo EX90, the company’s new flagship all-electric SUV. The long-delayed, three-row vehicle starts at a base price of $82,290, and has a range between 296 and 308 miles. It’s being manufactured in South Carolina and U.S. deliveries are expected toward the end of 2024. Here’s a distilled version of what everyone is saying:
</p><p>
<strong>The good: </strong>The SUV is comfortable, cushy, and beautifully designed. “<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/ex90?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The cabin has a nice ambience and a cool, premium feel.</a>” It has a very smooth ride and incredible torque considering its hefty weight. And the sound system is “<a href="https://www.wallpaper.com/transportation/volvo-ex90-driven?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genuinely astonishing.</a>”
</p><p>
<strong>The bad: </strong>Software glitches (no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto at launch, non-functional lidar), buggy connectivity (the phone-as-key feature seems particularly confused), <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ex90review/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">battery drain when parked</a>, and a cramped back row.
</p><p>
<strong>The bottom lines:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>“If you’re interested in an EX90, and its promise of serene emissions-free motoring, you’re just going to have to keep waiting. Wait until Volvo can polish the software, then buy the finished product. You shouldn’t spend $90,000 on a promise.” –<a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/731827/2025-volvo-ex90-first-drive/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mack Hogan</a>, deputy editor of <em><em>InsideEVs</em></em> </li>
<li>“Unless the need for a third row is not optional, it's hard to ignore the Polestar 3, built alongside the EX90 in South Carolina, which is several thousand dollars cheaper and much more fun to drive.” –<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/ex90review/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan M. Gitlin</a>, automotive editor at <em><em>Ars Technica </em></em></li>
<li>“The launch of the EX90 has been delayed by almost a year due to the complexity of getting the software right, and even that delay has not been enough to get it to a level you’d rightly expect of any new car launched in 2024, let alone one like the EX90.” –<a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/ex90?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Tisshaw</a>, editor at <em><em>Autocar</em></em> </li>
<li>“As a minimum viable product, the EX90 is still pretty good. Future updates and bug fixes will make it the luxury vehicle that Volvo hopes it will be, with all the promised bells and whistles.” –<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24233412/volvo-ex90-hands-on-specs-range-tech-lidar?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-85LREOujxSjjrYcpKmweCjHHecKDWT1yrfztuZCqMwEHk3DYgv5QPWDl1c7Md-687cTYgE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Abigail Basset</a> at <em><em>The Verge</em></em></li>

## Is the Election Already Hurting Clean Energy?

date: 2024-09-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU3NDc4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2Mjc5ODc2MX0.GbN38tbjvG6tK3kXGKRhpbyrzKpRYDTyv7ONzUGDU0Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Climate has <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dnc-climate-change" target="_blank">not exactly</a> been the focus in this election cycle that it was in 2024 — but the political climate could still be polarizing public opinion on clean energy. </p><p>For the latest Heatmap News poll, Embold Research surveyed more than 5,000 registered voters over two weeks in early August. When asked whether they were in favor clean energy projects in either their state, their local area, or near their own property, a majority of respondents said they were at least somewhat supportive, with declining levels of enthusiasm as the projects got closer to their homes. The responses also followed a predictable partisan gradient: 81% of Democrats supported clean energy projects “on a property near yours” compared to 28% of Republicans. But this level of support was also slightly lower than what it was in April, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/battery-support-survey" target="_self"><u>when Embold fielded a similar Heatmap survey</u></a>.</p><p>Support went up among members of both major parties as the hypothetical projects got further away from their homes, but across the board, the numbers were lower in August than they were in April. “We have seen a slight dip in voters’ support for various types of clean energy,” Embold analyst Ben Greenfield told me. As with any poll gyration, the dip could be a “statistical blip,” Greenfield said. But it’s also “possible that this is an election year phenomenon.”</p><p>“This is something we do occasionally see — that support for various types of policies and policy-related things can change in the heat of the an election year, even if they don’t seem on their face directly related to the election,” Greenfield added. While the opinions may be transitory, however, they can have long-lasting consequences.</p><p>Opposition to clean energy projects can manifest — and matter — at both the local and national level. A Republican congressional majority, for instance, if convinced that its constituents don’t see much value in wind and solar projects<strong>,</strong> may be more aggressive in unwinding parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Likewise, a great deal of the clean energy development activity supported by tax policy that was beefed up and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act has occurred in Republican-controlled districts and states. To the extent that local communities turn against clean energy because of its association with Democrats, it could mean a slower and dirtier transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Other differences between Republicans’ and Democrats’ survey answers appear to reflect not just attitudes toward clean energy in general, but also the respondents’ own values and preferences for energy projects. Even when Republicans support clean energy projects, Greenfield noted, their reasons for doing so are different from what Democrats cite.</p><p>When asked what would be a “strong” benefit of a clean energy project, the most popular answer for Republicans, garnering 47% support, was the claim that it “reduces our dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas.” Among Democrats, meanwhile, 76% picked out “combats climate change” as a benefit of clean energy, compared to 39% of independents and only 13% of Republicans. “On that question, Democrats are kind of equally interested in the economic benefits and environmental benefits, whereas Republicans are almost entirely focused on economic benefits,” Greenfield said. Donald Trump has made a point of attacking clean energy policies on economic grounds, especially <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>wind</u></a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-sharks-electric-boats" target="_self"><u>electric boats</u></a>, and depending on the day, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>electric cars</u></a>.</p><p>“We see lower support for wind than solar — at least rooftop solar,” Greenfield said. That could be because rooftop solar is seen as a way to save money and increase one’s own personal resilience, as opposed to a more purely environmental choice like wind power.</p><p>“We found that there’s more support for incentives for clean power plants, home renovations, building of factories in the U.S.,” Greenfield also noted, suggesting that clean energy policies with a more obvious economic nexus may be more popular than ones that are seen as more purely to do with climate change.</p><p>While Trump modulates his views on EVs seemingly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/12/trump-musk-electric-vehicles-00173682" target="_blank"><u>depending on how he feels about Elon Musk that day</u></a>, there’s good evidence that one reason he attacked them in the past is that he knew his supporters would like to hear it. When asked whether they thought installing a variety of clean energy technologies in their home would improve or diminish their quality of life, more than half of Republicans said an electric car would make their quality of life “much worse,” compared to just 5% of Democrats; over 50% of Democrats said an electric car would make their quality of life better.</p><p>“Any time we talk about EVs, we see  lower levels of support and stronger opposition among Republicans than you might expect people to have about a type of car,” Greenfield told me. “The big difference is the partisan difference on the environmental benefit and whether that is important. Clean energy tends to be a Democratic coded issue. That is clearly driving a lot of the partisan difference.”</p>

## Turkey arrests 15 accused of assaulting US servicemen

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

Ankara, Turkey/Washington  — A nationalist Turkish youth group physically assaulted two U.S. soldiers Monday in western Turkey, the U.S. Embassy in Turkey and the local governor's office said, adding that 15 assailants had been detained over the incident.


In a statement, the Izmir governor's office said members of the Turkey Youth Union (TGB), a youth branch of the nationalist opposition Vatan Party, "physically attacked" two U.S. soldiers dressed in civilian clothes in the Konak district.


It added that five U.S. soldiers joined in after seeing the incident, and that police intervened. All 15 attackers had been detained and an investigation was launched into the matter, it said.


A White House spokesperson said Monday, Washington was "troubled" by the assault but added it was "appreciative that Turkish police are taking this matter seriously and holding those responsible accountable."


The U.S. Embassy to Turkey also confirmed the attack and said the U.S. soldiers were now safe.


"We can confirm reports that U.S. service members embarked aboard the USS Wasp were the victims of an assault in Izmir today, and are now safe," it said on social media platform X.


Earlier, the TGB posted a video on X showing a group holding down a man on the street and putting a white hood over his head, while shouting slogans.


The group said the man was a soldier on board the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara had said earlier Monday that the ship was carrying out a port visit to the Aegean coastal town of Izmir this week.


"U.S. soldiers who carry the blood of our soldiers and thousands of Palestinians on their hands cannot dirty our country. Every time you step foot in these lands, we will meet you the way you deserve," TGB said.


U.S.-Turkey ties have been strained in recent years by the U.S. alliance with Syrian Kurds that Turkey deems extremists, and over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 defenses that prompted U.S. sanctions and removal from a F-35 jet program.


There has also been divergence over Israel's war in Gaza, where over 40,000 people have been killed according to Gaza authorities, and over which Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has sharply criticized Washington's ally.


Earlier this month, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey said U.S.-Turkey relations are now "in a better place than we've been in a while" and noted the "useful role" Turkey played in a recent prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia.

## 5 people shot at New York's West Indian American Day Parade

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

new york — Five people were shot Monday at New York City’s West Indian American Day Parade, police said. It was the latest incident of violence to mar one of the world’s largest annual celebrations of Caribbean culture.


A gunman targeting a specific group of people opened fire along the parade route in Brooklyn around 2:35 p.m., NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said. The parade had kicked off hours earlier, with thousands of revelers dancing and marching down Eastern Parkway, a main thoroughfare through the borough. It was expected to continue into the night.


Two people were critically wounded, Chell said. The three other victims were expected to survive their injuries, he said. The gunman fled.


“This was not random,” Chell said. “This was an intentional act by one person towards a group of people. We do not by no means have any active shooter or anything of that nature running around Eastern Parkway as we speak. The parade is going on and will go on until later on tonight.”


An Associated Press videographer who was nearby when the shots rang out saw at least two people being treated for what appeared to be wounds to the face and arm. 


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was marching in the parade at the time and completed the route. A message was left with Schumer's office.


Police cordoned off an area adjacent to the parade route, where they placed crime scene markers. The parade continued flowing past as officers were seen bagging items.


Chell asked that bystanders provide police with any video footage they may have recorded of the shooting.


“We need that video,” Chell said. “We are going to solve this, but it’s going to take a lot of work.”


The parade, an annual Labor Day event in its 57th year, turns Eastern Parkway into a kaleidoscope of feather-covered costumes and colorful flags as participants make their way down the thoroughfare alongside floats stacked high with speakers playing soca and reggae music.


The parade routinely attracts huge crowds, who line the almost 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) route that runs from Crown Heights to the Brooklyn Museum. It’s also a popular destination for local politicians, many of whom are of West Indian heritage or represent members of the city’s large Caribbean community.




Though a joyous occasion, the parade and related celebrations have been plagued by violence over the years.


In 2016, two people were killed and several others were wounded near the parade route. The year before, Carey Gabay, an aide to then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, was shot in the head during pre-parade festivities. He died nine days later.


The West Indian American Day Parade has its roots in more traditionally timed, pre-Lent Carnival celebrations started by a Trinidadian immigrant in Manhattan around a century ago, according to the organizers. The festivities were moved to the warmer time of year in the 1940s.


Brooklyn, where hundreds of thousands of Caribbean immigrants and their descendants have settled, began hosting the parade in the 1960s.


The Labor Day parade is now the culmination of days of carnival events in the city, which include a steel pan band competition and J’Ouvert, a separate street party commemorating freedom from slavery.

## What we can learn from vintage computing

date: 2024-09-02, from: OS News

Thanks to open source, no technology ever has to become obsolete, so long as a community remains to support it. You can sync Newtons and Palm Pilots with modern desktops, download web browsers for long-discontinued operating systems, or connect vintage computers like the Apple IIe&#160;to the modern internet via WiFi. Every year, new cartridges are released&#160;for old-school video game consoles&#160;like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. People keep old software and online platforms alive as well. The&#160;Dreamwidth&#160;team forked an old version of the early social network&#160;LiveJournal&#8217;s source code&#160;and built a community around it. The dial-up bulletin board system software&#160;WWIV&#160;is still maintained and there are&#160;plenty of BBSes&#160;still around. Teams are working to restore aspects of early online services like AOL and Prodigy. And you can still use Gopher, the hypertext protocol that was — for a brief period in the early 1990s — bigger than the web. ↫ Klint Finley Retrocomputing is about a lot of things, and I feel like it differs per person. For me, it&#8217;s a little bit of nostalgia, but primarily it&#8217;s about learning, and experiencing hardware and software I was unable to experience when they were new, either due to high cost or just general unavailability. There&#8217;s a lot to learn from platforms that are no longer among us, and often it helps you improve your skills with the modern platforms you do still use. The linked article is right: open source is playing such a massive role in the retrocomputing community. The number of open source projects allowing you to somehow use decades-old platforms in conjunction with modern technologies is massive, and it goes far beyond just software &#8211; projects like BlueSCSI or very niche things like usb3sun highlights there&#8217;s also hardware-based solutions for just about anything retro you want to accomplish. And we really can&#8217;t forget NetBSD, which seems to be the go-to modern operating system for bringing new life to old and retro hardware, as it often runs on just about anything. When I got my PA-RISC workstation, the HP Visualize c3750, I couldn&#8217;t find working copies of HP-UX, so I, too, opted for NetBSD to at least be able to see if the computer was fully functional. NetBSD is now a tool in my toolbox when I&#8217;m dealing with older, unique hardware. Retrocomputing is in a great place right now, with the exception of the ballooning prices we&#8217;re all suffering from, with even successful mainstay YouTubers like LGR lamenting the state of the market. Still, if you do get your hands on something retro &#8211; odds are there&#8217;s a whole bunch of tools ready for you to make the most of it, even today.

## The Mouse programming language on CP/M

date: 2024-09-02, from: OS News

Mouse is an interpreted stack orientated language designed by Peter Grogono around 1975. It was designed to be a small but powerful language for microcomputers, similar to Forth, but much simpler. One obvious difference to Forth is that Mouse interprets a stream of characters most of which are only a single character and it relies more on variables rather than rearranging the stack as much. The version for CP/M on the Walnut Creek CD is quite small at only 2k. ↫ Lawrence Woodman (2020) Even with very little to no programming experience I can tell that this language looks a lot smaller and more compact than other code I&#8217;ve seen. I&#8217;ll have to leave it to the actual programmers and developers among the OSNews audience to provide more valuable insight, but I feel like there&#8217;s definitely something here that&#8217;ll interest some of you.

## US seizes plane used by Venezuela's Maduro, citing sanctions violations

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. government has seized a plane used by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that officials say was illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States, citing violations of sanctions and export control laws.


The Dassault Falcon 900EX was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the custody of federal officials in Florida, the Justice Department said Monday.


U.S. officials say associates of the Venezuelan leader used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the purchase of the plane, valued at the time at $13 million, from a company in Florida. The plane was exported from the U.S. to Venezuela, through the Caribbean, in April 2023 in a transaction meant to circumvent an executive order that bars U.S. persons from business transactions with the Maduro regime.


The plane, registered to San Marino, was widely used by Maduro for foreign travel, including for trip earlier this year to Guyana and Cuba.


"Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,” Matthew Axelrod, an assistant secretary for export enforcement in the Commerce Department, said in a statement.


CNN first reported the plane seizure.


The seizure announcement comes just over a month after Venezuelans headed to the polls for a highly anticipated presidential election in which ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor without showing any detailed results to back up their claim. The lack of transparency has drawn international condemnation against Maduro’s government.


Meanwhile, the opposition managed to obtain more than 80% of vote tally sheets – considered the ultimate proof of results – nationwide. The documents, the faction said, show Maduro losing by a wide margin against former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez.


It was also the plane that carried several Americans jailed for years in Venezuela to the Caribbean Island of Canouan last December where they were swapped for a close Maduro ally, businessman Alex Saab, imprisoned in the U.S. on money laundering charges.


In March, it flew to the Dominican Republic, along with a Venezuelan-registered plane, for what was believed to be maintenance, never to leave again.


The U.S. has sanctioned 55 Venezuelan-registered planes belonging to state owned oil giant PDVSA.


It’s also offered a $15 million bounty for the arrest of Maduro to face federal drug trafficking charges in New York.


The Venezuelan government’s centralized press office did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Monday.

## Microsoft says its Recall uninstall option in Windows 11 is just a bug

date: 2024-09-02, from: OS News

Despite reports to the contrary, Microsoft has stated that Recall will not be uninstallable after all. The feature did show up in the Windows Features dialog, but apparently, that was a bug. “We are aware of an issue where Recall is incorrectly listed as an option under the ‘Turn Windows features on or off’ dialog in Control Panel,” says Windows senior product manager Brandon LeBlanc in a statement to The Verge. “This will be fixed in an upcoming update.” ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge The company is not committing to saying it will not ever be uninstallable, probably because the European Union might have something to say about that. At the very least you&#8217;ll be able to turn Recall off, but it seems actually removing it might not be possible for a while.

## Shuttered in Shanghai, Chinese bookstore reopens in Washington

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A Chinese bookstore reopened in Washington on Sunday, six years after the Chinese government forced it to close its doors in Shanghai.


JF Books was teeming with books — and customers — when it opened its doors in Washington’s Dupont Circle neighborhood. In the storefront, the shop’s name is displayed in English and Mandarin in neon green lights. The sporadic rain was perhaps fitting considering the bookstore’s namesake “jifeng” means “monsoon” in Mandarin.


The bookstore is located next to Kramers, an indie bookstore that has been a Washington fixture for decades. Yu Miao, who runs JF Books, says he hopes his bookstore becomes an institution for the local community, too.


“I hope the bookstore can establish a connection between people in the Chinese community, and this connection could be established through knowledge,” Yu told VOA shortly before the shop opened for business. “Also, I hope the bookstore’s function can go beyond the Chinese community. It can also contribute to the local community.”


The shop sells Chinese-language books from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, in addition to a selection of English-language books. It will also regularly host speakers for events.


Founded in Shanghai in 1997 as Jifeng Bookstore, the shop ran into trouble in 2017 when its landlord said the lease couldn’t be extended. The bookstore looked for a new location, but the prospective landlords at each potential site received warnings or notifications from the government.


Jifeng Bookstore is one of several independent bookstores that Beijing has forced to close in recent years.


The fact that bookstores have become a battleground underscores the Chinese government’s broader repression of free expression and crackdown on anything deemed to be critical of the government, according to Sophie Richardson, the former China director at Human Rights Watch.


“[Chinese President] Xi Jinping and his government have clearly targeted a great deal of hostility at scholars,” Richardson told VOA at the bookstore. “Their books are regarded as potential threats, and so the party does what the party knows how to do, which is to send people into exile, to send them to jail, to shut down bookstores.”


China’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story.




Gesturing at the throngs of people who were looking at books about everything from Chinese history to science, Richardson, who is now a visiting scholar at Stanford, added that there is a clear hunger for Chinese books.


“It’s amazing to see this clear demand for this kind of material in an environment where people can get it free of fear of persecution,” she said.


That’s another reason why Yu wanted to reopen the bookstore: It can be difficult to find Chinese-language books in the United States, he said. “And so, I think there must be many others that have the same concern,” he said.


When Jifeng Bookstore closed its doors in 2018, Yu never expected it to reopen.


“I thought it was closed, then its story ended,” Yu said. “I never imagined to reopen the bookstore.”


Now, JF Books has joined a rising number of independent Chinese bookstores that are being opened by members of the diaspora in cities around the world. They sell books and hold discussions about politics and history in a way that the Chinese government has stifled inside China.


JF Books already has scheduled three speakers for September. Howard Shen, a graduate student at Georgetown University, told VOA that he’s especially excited about the upcoming events.


“It’s such a big thing in the Chinese speaking community in D.C. We are all very excited to have this bookstore. It’s such a meaningful place for all Chinese in the world who love freedom,” said Shen, who is from Taiwan. 


One corner of the store features farewell messages that customers wrote back when the store was forced to shutter in 2018. Leading up to the bookstore’s second floor, photos on the wall memorialize the bookstore’s two-decade history in Shanghai. At the top of the staircase, photos show the bookstore’s final day in 2018.


“Jifeng Bookstore will soon depart from Shanghai,” the caption of one photo reads, “but the monsoon will continue to blow.”

## US prioritizes deterrence over denuclearization on North Korea, experts say

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

washington — As North Korea's nuclear and missile programs become increasingly sophisticated, U.S.-based experts see the United States shifting the focus of its diplomacy from the pursuit of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to one of deterrence. 


Officially, the U.S. State Department insists that denuclearization remains the primary goal of the United States and South Korea, a policy that is unlikely to change regardless of the outcome of the November U.S. presidential election. 


But in a series of email interviews with VOA Korean, more than half a dozen experts said they saw scant hope that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could be persuaded to give up his growing nuclear arsenal and that the U.S. must concentrate instead on seeing that it is never used.  


"I think, in practical terms, most Americans believe we have little choice at this point but to prioritize deterrence, at least for the foreseeable future," said Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution in Washington, in an email to VOA Korean this week.  


Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that American politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are questioning whether North Korea would even consider abandoning its nuclear weapons. 


"I think there is little appetite in either political party to seek denuclearization with North Korea, given the failures of the late 2010s," Peters said, referring to the collapse of the nuclear talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who met three times in 2018 and 2019. 


"I think all sides recognize that Kim will not give up nuclear weapons at any price."  




Shifting priorities 


Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program between Washington and Pyongyang have been nearly nonexistent since October 2019. 


Peters added, "Bottom line — without question, the ground has shifted regarding how we think about the North Korean nuclear threat."  


Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Washington's shift in direction was inevitable. 


"The U.S. government has been forced to place more emphasis on deterrence over denuclearization because Kim Jong Un has shown no willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal or even meet with the U.S. to discuss denuclearization," Samore told VOA Korean via email. 


"Instead, North Korea has continued to advance its nuclear and missile program, and the U.S. has responded by strengthening military cooperation with the ROK and Japan, including joint efforts to enhance extended deterrence." 


ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea.  


Denuclearization of North Korea is now viewed in Washington as a "mission impossible," said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. 


"I think it is fair to say that the U.S. government is now more focused on deterrence, which is largely succeeding, than on denuclearization," Bennett told VOA Korean via email. 


"This change does not mean that the U.S. and ROK have abandoned trying to negotiate for denuclearization, which North Korea steadfastly refuses to do, but rather that our governments no longer see denuclearization as a viable solution to the North Korean nuclear weapon threat." 


Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean via email it was "fully appropriate" that Washington has been paying more attention in recent years to deterring North Korean aggression than attempting to negotiate denuclearization. 




"I have long argued that Kim Jong Un does not intend to give up his nuclear weapons, that the nuclear weapons and missile capabilities of North Korea have grown and will continue to grow, meaning that we in the United States and its allies must adjust our strategy and policy accordingly," he said. 


"We should not let hopes of negotiations get in the way of making tough decisions to improve deterrence," added Garlauskas, who served as the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea from 2014 to 2020. 


He stressed, however, that "accepting the reality that North Korea is nuclear-armed and will remain so while under Kim Jong Un's leadership" does not mean that the U.S. should or would give up denuclearization as a goal. 


"Our principled stand can and should remain that North Korea must comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions by halting its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and I do think there is still broad agreement on that in Washington," Garlauskas said. 


Commitment to denuclearization 


Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said the U.S. should keep denuclearization as a priority, adding that "denuclearization and deterrence are not mutually exclusive." 


"We have a responsibility on a day-by-day basis to deter provocative actions, coercion, blackmail and even possible invasion by North Korea and have been doing so for the last 70 years of armistice," said Seiler, who is now a senior adviser on Korean affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 


"Successfully ensuring deterrence does not mean abandoning the goal of the denuclearization of North Korea," he told VOA Korean via email. 


Robert Abrams, a retired U.S. Army four-star general who served as commander of U.S. Forces Korea from 2018 to 2021, emphasized that a strategy of deterrence should be clearly differentiated from the goal of denuclearization. 


"The U.S. strategic deterrent was never about stopping the North Korean regime from developing their own nukes," Abrams told VOA Korean in an August 20 email. 


"Sanctions and diplomatic efforts were intended to stop North Korea's nuclear program. The strategic deterrent is to deter North Korea from ever using nuclear weapons, and that has obviously been very successful." 


Officially, Washington reiterates that denuclearization of North Korea remains a goal of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. 


"The United States and the ROK continue to pursue the shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," a State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean via email this week. "We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons." 


But the spokesperson stressed that deterrence was also a crucial element of U.S. policy toward North Korea. 


"At the same time, the United States and the ROK will continue working together to strengthen extended deterrence in the face of increasingly aggressive DPRK rhetoric about its nuclear weapons program," the spokesperson said. 


He added that the 16-month-old Washington Declaration "reinforces the fact that any nuclear attack by [North Korea] against [South Korea] will be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response from the United States." 


In April 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol adopted the Washington Declaration, which outlines a series of measures to deter North Korea's nuclear weapons use.

## At US theme parks, Halloween celebrations start in summer

los angeles, california — Halloween has arrived earlier than ever at major U.S. theme parks, as operators such as Disney, Six Flags, and Universal Studios seek to expand their reach and build on consumers' love of spooky costumes and scares. 


Theme park operators have introduced a range of attractions, live performances, merchandise and food and beverages in August — before summer has ended and well before the October 31 holiday — to take advantage of the surging popularity of Halloween. These holiday-themed efforts come at a time when domestic theme park attendance has slumped, following a surge in demand after COVID.  


Edithann Ramey, chief marketing officer at Six Flags, told Reuters that the theme parks saw attendance gains and increases in guest spending in 2023 when it introduced attractions based on the horror films "SAW" and "The Conjuring." 


The offerings were so successful that the theme park company has been investing more in Halloween experiences, Ramey said. 


"It's become this time of the year that's grown in explosive ways," Ramey said. "It's become a billion-dollar industry in the last five years."


Jakob Wahl, chief executive for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, said Halloween has become one of the strongest selling points for parks that cater to young people and families.  


"We actually see a growth every year in terms of Halloween events, not only North America, but across the world," Wahl said.  


Disney starts season in August


Walt Disney's parks started the Halloween season earlier than ever this year with "Mickey's Not So Scary Party" beginning on August 9 and running through the end of October.  


The Oogie Boogie Bash, a separately ticketed event named for the "Nightmare Before Christmas" villain, sold out this year in 11 days, Disney said. Its popularity prompted the company to push the release date to August 25 from September 5. 


"We've seen from our guests in years past that there's a demand for them to come and enjoy that season with us," said Tracy Halas, creative director of Disney Live Entertainment.  


Six Flags also kicks off Halloween early this year, on September 14, with a new experience called "Saw: Legacy of Terror" celebrating the 20th anniversary of the "SAW" horror movie franchise.  


Following the $8 billion merger of Six Flags and former rival Cedar Fair, which created the nation's largest amusement park operator, with 42 parks across 17 states, Six Flags is increasing its investment in Halloween.  


That includes adding Hollywood-themed experiences to Six Flags Fright Fest based on Netflix's science fiction series, "Stranger Things," as well as horror films "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and "The Conjuring."


Universal adds 'Ghostbusters' haunted house 


Comcast-owned Universal Studios 2024 Halloween Horror Nights in Orlando runs from August 30 to November 3, the longest season they've ever had. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 


Universal is adding a "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" haunted house to its Halloween programming alongside the first attraction inspired by horror franchise, "A Quiet Place."  


Universal also aims to attract guests at Universal Studios Japan with a new 4D show in collaboration with the anime television series "Chainsaw Man."  


Both Universal Orlando and Japan will add cast members dressed as the antagonists called Death Eaters to haunt Diagon Alley during Horror Nights.  


Disney villain Cruella de Vil hosted a "Let's Get Wicked" celebration at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2022, which received an industry award and returns this year.

## TypeSpec reminds us why OpenAPI exists in the first place

date: 2024-09-02, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve recently found out about <a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a>, a new language aimed at describing web APIs, through <a href="https://nordicapis.com/api-design-in-the-post-openapi-era/">an interview</a> that bears the provocative title of <em>API Design in the Post-OpenAPI Era</em>. Leaving aside the fact that OpenAPI is very much alive, what left me stupefied was the assertion that OpenAPI files should be &ldquo;automatically generated artifacts and nothing more&rdquo;. After digging a bit, I found the picture to be slightly more reassuring, but still quite representative of a world that keeps steering away from human-driven design to bury itself in curly brackets paradises. A regression, rather than progress, if you ask me.</p>

## California lawmakers approve laws banning deepfakes, regulating AI

date: 2024-09-02, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — California lawmakers approved a host of proposals this week aiming to regulate the artificial intelligence industry, combat deepfakes and protect workers from exploitation by the rapidly evolving technology.


The California Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, is voting on hundreds of bills during its final week of the session to send to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Their deadline is Saturday.


The Democratic governor has until Sept. 30 to sign the proposals, veto them or let them become law without his signature. Newsom signaled in July he will sign a proposal to crack down on election deepfakes but has not weighed in on other legislation.


He warned earlier this summer that overregulation could hurt the homegrown industry. In recent years, he often has cited the state’s budget troubles when rejecting legislation that he would otherwise support.


Here is a look at some of the AI bills lawmakers approved this year.


Combating deepfakes


Citing concerns over how AI tools are increasingly being used to trick voters and generate deepfake pornography of minors, California lawmakers approved several bills this week to crack down on the practice.


Lawmakers approved legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections and require large social media platforms to remove the deceptive material 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. Campaigns also would be required to publicly disclose if they’re running ads with materials altered by AI.


A pair of proposals would make it illegal to use AI tools to create images and videos of child sexual abuse. Current law does not allow district attorneys to go after people who possess or distribute AI-generated child sexual abuse images if they cannot prove the materials are depicting a real person.


Tech companies and social media platforms would be required to provide AI detection tools to users under another proposal.


Setting safety guardrails


California could become the first state in the nation to set sweeping safety measures on large AI models.


The legislation sent by lawmakers to the governor’s desk requires developers to start disclosing what data they use to train their models. The efforts aim to shed more light into how AI models work and prevent future catastrophic disasters.


Another measure would require the state to set safety protocols preventing risks and algorithmic discrimination before agencies could enter any contract involving AI models used to define decisions.


Protecting workers


Inspired by the monthslong Hollywood actors strike last year, lawmakers approved a proposal to protect workers, including voice actors and audiobook performers, from being replaced by their AI-generated clones. The measure mirrors language in the contract the SAG-AFTRA made with studios last December.


State and local agencies would be banned from using AI to replace workers at call centers under one of the proposals.


California also may create penalties for digitally cloning dead people without consent of their estates.


Keeping up with the technology


As corporations increasingly weave AI into Americans' daily lives, state lawmakers also passed several bills to increase AI literacy.


One proposal would require a state working group to consider incorporating AI skills into math, science, history and social science curriculums. Another would develop guidelines on how schools could use AI in the classrooms.

## I made an app to fix my motion sickness

date: 2024-09-02, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>Last May, Apple announced a new feature called <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong> for their iOS devices. It’s an overlay that can help reduce motion sickness while riding a vehicle.</p>

<p>I have really bad motion sickness, and riding cars, buses, and trains makes me nauseous. This feature would have been a nice relief for me, but as it stands, I use Android.</p>

<p>Instead of buying a Malus fruit device, I took the matter into my own programmer hands. I created an alternative app for Android.</p>

<p><span>To be sure, I checked the patents. Apple does have one regarding a certain motion sickness solution, but it’s specifically for head-mounted displays, not handheld devices. I figured it’s because there is prior art for handheld devices, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.kinestop&amp;pcampaignid=web_share"><strong>KineStop</strong> for Android by Urbandroid</a>.</span></p>

<p>My app is called <strong>EasyQueasy</strong>. What it does is display onscreen vestibular signals that try to help prevent motion sickness. This functions as an overlay that is displayed on top of whatever you’re doing, browsing the web or watching videos.</p>

<video muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" aria-label="demo video showing the app running in a moving train" alt="demo video showing the app running in a moving train" data-src="/notes/motion-sickness-app/demo.mp4">
                <source src="https://leanrada.com/gen/_notes_motion_sickness_app_demo_664.generated.mp4?ref=rss">

                Video: demo video showing the app running in a moving train | Source: /notes/motion-sickness-app/demo.mp4

              </video>

<p>The app is open source. I might try to get it on F-Droid someday. <small>Probably not Google Play since Google suspended my developer account due to “inactivity”.</small></p>

<p>I made this for myself so I haven’t really sorted out distribution. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/EasyQueasy">GitHub repo is here anyway</a>.</p>

<p><span>Side note: Apologies to the RSS readers of this blog and <code>segfault</code>. I accidentally published this post in the RSS feed, but not on the site, which lead to an incomplete draft post and a 404 error.</span></p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>There are two facets to this inquiry:</p>

<ol>
              <li>How does it help with motion sickness?</li>
              <li>How does the app work behind the scenes?</li>
            </ol>

<p>Let’s go over them sequentially.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-unsick-motion">How to unsick motion</h2>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness"><strong>Motion sickness</strong></a> happens when your brain receives conflicting motion cues from your senses. Motion cues come from the <strong>vestibular system</strong> (“sense of balance”, inner ears) and the <strong>visual system</strong> (eyes).</p>

<img srcset="/notes/motion-sickness-app/1.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" caption="The system diagram" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/motion-sickness-app/1.png?ref=rss">
<span>The system diagram</span>
<p>When you’re in a moving car, your eyes mostly see the stationary interiors of the car but your inner ears feel the movement. The signal of being stationary and the signal of being in motion does not make <em>sense</em> in the central processing system somewhere in the brain <em>(which decides that the solution to this particular situation is to vomit)</em>.</p>

<img srcset="/notes/motion-sickness-app/2.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" data-placeholder="" caption="There’s a bug in the central processing module that triggers an unexpected response to conflicting signals." src="https://leanrada.com/notes/motion-sickness-app/2.png?ref=rss">
<span>There’s a bug in the central processing module that triggers an unexpected response to conflicting signals.</span>
<p><span>Side note: The inverse happens in virtual reality when you move or rotate your character — your eyes recognise motion but your inner ears (your physical body) feel no motion, causing sickness. As I mentioned, I have really bad motion sickness, and both car movement and VR movement are almost unbearable to me.</span></p>

<p>To reduce motion sickness, we need to match the visual input with the vestibular input. Unfortunately, there’s no hardware that can override the inner ears’ sense of motion just yet. But we can semi-hijack the visual system via age-old hardware called screens.</p>

<p>By displaying movement on-screen that matches the actual movement of the body, motion sickness can be thus reduced!</p>

<p>Almost every smartphone has an <strong>accelerometer</strong> in them. It’s a hardware module that measures <em>acceleration</em> in real time.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the inner ears also sense the same particular aspect of motion, <em>acceleration</em>. That’s why it can detect up or down (the planet’s gravity is an ever-present acceleration towards “down”), functioning as a “sense of balance”, and detect relative motion at the same time.</p>

<p>So, smartphones have “inner ear” hardware. By reading off of this sensor, we can generate the correct visuals.</p>

              <p>The other Android app, KineStop, appear to use the phone’s magnetic sensor (compass) in addition to the accelerometer. So, it also knows about your absolute orientation in the world. It’s more effective in turning motions, but not so much for bumpy rides.</p>
              <p>There are definitely multiple ways to solve the problem, but I find that the purely acceleration-based solution is sufficient for me.</p>

<h2 id="dead-reckoning">Dead reckoning</h2>

<p>The accelerometer provides acceleration data, but what we actually need to draw dots on the screen is <strong>position</strong>.</p>

<p>Recall in calculus or physics that the integral of acceleration is the <em>velocity</em> and the integral of velocity is <em>position</em>. There are two layers of integration before we can draw dots on the screen.</p>

<p><code>acceleration → velocity → position</code></p>

<p>What the app does is <a target="_blank" href="http://lampx.tugraz.at/~hadley/physikm/apps/a2x.en.php"><strong>numerical integration</strong></a>. It keeps track of an estimated velocity and an estimated position in memory. Then, on every tick, it adds the current acceleration vector to the velocity vector, and add the velocity to the position. Note: all vectors here are in 3D. </p>

<p>The calculated position vector provides an estimate of the phone’s current position! Finally, we can draw dots!</p>

<p>To provide the correct sensation of movement, the dots must appear stable relative to the origin, that is, the earth. Negating the calculated position vector achieves this effect.</p>

<pre><code><span>// pseudocode</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  position <span>+=</span> velocity
  <span>drawDots</span><span>(</span>offset <span>=</span> <span>-</span>position<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="error-correction">Error correction</h2>

<p>The accelerometer signal is very <strong>noisy</strong>. While that is workable for many applications, when we’re doing position integration the errors really add up, and simple dead reckoning is way off.</p>

<p>Standard signal processing techniques can be applied to deal with noise, like a low-pass filter.</p>

<pre><code><span>// Example: With a low-pass filter</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// low-pass filter</span>
  smoothAcceleration <span>+=</span>
    <span>(</span>accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> smoothAcceleration<span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>0.60</span>

  <span>// position integration</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> smoothAcceleration
  position <span>+=</span> velocity

  <span>drawDots</span><span>(</span>offset <span>=</span> <span>-</span>position<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>But a simpler solution like dampening the velocity over time is plenty sufficient.</p>

<pre><code><span>// Example: With velocity dampening</span>
<span>onEveryFrame</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// position integration</span>
  velocity <span>+=</span> accelerometer<span>.</span><span>getAcceleration</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  position <span>+=</span> velocity

  <span>// dampen</span>
  velocity <span>*=</span> <span>0.80</span>

  <span>drawDots</span><span>(</span>offset <span>=</span> <span>-</span>position<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>And that is basically how EasyQueasy works. And presumably iOS does it similarly as well.</p>

<h2 id="easyqueasy-features">EasyQueasy features</h2>

<p>EasyQueasy’s features and advantages over the current iOS solution are:</p>

<ul>
              <li>Configurable speed and other parameters.</li>
              <li>It’s 3D! Because movement in the real-world is three-dimensional!</li>
              <li>Option to activate the overlay from any screen via quick gesture shortcuts.</li>
            </ul>
