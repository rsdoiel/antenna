id="sinead-oconnors-estate-tells-trump-stop-playing-her-music-at-rallies">Sinead
O’Connor’s Estate Tells Trump: ‘Stop Playing Her Music at Rallies’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — The estate of Sinead O’Connor asked Donald Trump Monday not
to play her music at campaign rallies, saying the late singer considered
the former president a “biblical devil.”</p>
<p>Trump has played O’Connor’s biggest hit, “Nothing Compares 2 U,” at
events as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, O’Connor’s estate and her record label,
Chrysalis, demanded Trump “desist from using her music immediately.”</p>
<p>It said the Irish singer, who died last year aged 56, “lived by a
fierce moral code defined by honesty, kindness, fairness and decency
towards her fellow human beings.”</p>
<p>“It was with outrage therefore that we learned that Donald Trump has
been using her iconic performance of Nothing Compares 2 U at his
political rallies,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“It is no exaggeration to say that Sinead would have been disgusted,
hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone
who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil.’ As the guardians of
her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump and his associates desist from
using her music immediately.”</p>
<p>Fiery and outspoken, O’Connor was a critic of the Roman Catholic
Church well before  </p>
<p>allegations of sexual abuse were widely reported, and she was open
about her mental health struggles.</p>
<p>She was found unresponsive at her London home in July and pronounced
dead at the scene. A coroner ruled that she died of natural causes.</p>
<p>O’Connor joins a growing list of artists who have objected to Trump
using their songs, including Rihanna, Neil Young, Linkin Park, the late
Tom Petty and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler.</p>

<h2 id="israel-and-palestine">2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –
<a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement
by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North
Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

John Kerry, the first special presidential envoy for climate, is leaving
government. On Wednesday he’ll hand the reins to White House senior
advisor John Podesta, though Kerry plans to stay involved in the global
fight against climate change on a less formal level. “The reason that
I’ve decided to transition from this job is not because we’re finished,”

the <em>Financial Times</em>. “But as U.S. envoy, I’m presently
responsible for the U.S. position, for what we’re doing here. If I’m out
there as a citizen, I’m able to work with whoever I choose to work with
in order to help accelerate this [transition away from fossil fuels].”
Specifically, he plans to focus on securing more funding for the energy
transition, having

burned more than 1 million acres and is the largest fire in the state’s
history. Two people are known to have died in the blaze. On top of the
threat to human life is the danger posed to the millions of cattle that
graze in the Texas Panhandle. The fire has scorched grassland and left
farmers without food or water for their herds.

explains how BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is carefully
continuing a climate investing strategy while simultaneously attempting
to sidestep ESG backlash. The company has stopped trying to change how
companies behave, talking about social issues, or fussing over criteria
for responsible investing. Instead it’s betting on clean-energy
infrastructure projects that will speed the transition away from fossil
fuels, a strategy it calls “transition investing.” ESG was too vague,
sources said, and failed to outpace the market or prove good for the
planet. Meanwhile, private renewable-energy and broad energy-sector
investment funds have raised nearly $500 billion over the last five
years “and dwarfed the amount raised for traditional fossil-fuel funds,”
the <em>Journal</em> reported. “The mega infrastructure projects are the
new ESG,” said Peter McKillop, a former spokesman at BlackRock.
“Energy-transition infrastructure — Wall Street loves this because it’s

global oil and gas infrastructure using a high-resolution infrared
sensor. It can see how much methane is leaking, where it’s coming from,
and whether a leak is getting better (or worse) over time. The team will
analyze the data using cloud computing and Google-developed AI
technology, and then release the findings to the public, with the hopes
of fostering greater accountability from the offenders. But, “there’s no

The real problem with anonymity (04 Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The real problem with anonymity: The banal anonymity of
evil. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me.
Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep
readin’ em, I’ll keep writin’ ‘em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I’ll
keep writin’ ‘em. Colophon: All the rest. The real problem with
anonymity (permalink) According to “the greater internet fuckwad
theory,” the ills of the internet can be traced to anonymity: Normal
Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/greater-internet-fuckwad-theory This
isn’t merely wrong, it’s dangerously wrong. The idea that forcing people
to identify themselves online will improve discourse is demonstrably
untrue. Facebook famously adopted its “real names” policy because Mark
Zuckerberg claimed to believe that “Having two identities for yourself
is an example of a lack of integrity”:
https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html
In service to this claimed belief, Zuckerberg kicked off the “nym wars,”
turning himself into the sole arbiter of what each person’s true name
was, with predictably tragicomic consequences:
https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/
Facebook is, famously, one of the internet’s most polluted reservoirs of
toxic interpersonal conduct. That’s not despite the fact that people
have to use their “real” names to participate there, but because of it.
After all, the people who are most vulnerable to bullying and harassment
are the ones who choose pseudonyms or anonymity so that they can speak
freely. Forcing people to use their “real names” means that the most
powerful bullies speak with impunity, and their victims are faced with
the choice of retreat or being targeted offline. This can be a matter of
life and death. Cambodian dictator Hun Sen uses Facebook’s real names
policy to force dissidents to unmask themselves, which exposes them to
arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing. For members of
the Cambodian diaspora, the choice is to unmask themselves or expose
their family back home to retaliation:

Some of the biggest internet fuckwads I’ve ever met – and I’ve met some
big ones! – were utterly unashamed about using their real names. Some of
the nicest people I know online have never told me their offline names.
Greater internet fuckwad theory is just plain wrong. But that doesn’t
mean that anonymity is totally harmless. There is a category of person
who reliably uses a certain, specific kind of anonymity to do vicious
things that inflicts serious harm on whole swathes of people: corporate
bullies. Take Tinyletter. Tinyletter is a beloved newsletter app that
was created to help people who just wanted to talk to others, without a
thought to going viral or getting rich. It was sold to Mailchimp, which
was sold to Intuit, who killed it:
https://www.theverge.com/24085737/tinyletter-mailchimp-shut-down-email-newsletters
Tinyletter was a perfect little gem of a service. It cost almost nothing
to run, and made an enormous number of peoples’ lives better every day.
Shutting it down was an act of corporate depravity but some faceless
Intuit manager who woke up one day and said “Fuck all those people. Just
fuck them.” No one knows who that person was. That person will never
have to look those people in the eyes – those people whose lives were
made poorer for that Intuit executive’s indifference. That person is the
greater fuckwad, and that fuckwaddery depends on their anonymity. Or
take Pixsy, a corporate shakedown outfit that helps copyleft trolls
trick people into making tiny errors in Creative Commons attributions
and then intimidates them into handing over thousands of dollars:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/24/a-bug-in-early-creative-commons-licenses-has-enabled-a-new-breed-of-superpredator/
Copyleft trolling is an absolutely depraved practice, a petty grift
practiced by greedy fuckwads who are completely indifferent to the harm
they cause – even if it means bankrupting volunteer-run nonprofits for a
buck:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/02/commafuckers-versus-the-commons/
Pixsy claims that it is proud of its work “defending artists’ rights,”
but when I named the personnel who signed their names to these
profoundly unethical legal threats, Pixsy CEO Kain Jones threatened to
sue me:

The expectation of corporate anonymity runs deep and the press is
surprisingly complicit. I once spent weeks working on an investigative
story about a multinational corporation’s practices. I spent hours on
the phone with the company’s VP of communications, over the course of
many calls. When we were done, they said, “Now, of course, you can’t
name me in the article. All of that has to be attributed to ‘a
spokesperson.’” I was baffled. Nothing this person said was a secret.
They weren’t blowing the whistle. They weren’t leaking secrets. They
were a corporate official, telling me the official corporate line. But
they wouldn’t sign their name to it. I wrote an article about for the
Guardian. It was the only Guardian column any of my editors there ever
rejected, in more than a decade of writing for them:
https://memex.craphound.com/2012/05/14/anodyne-anonymity/ Given the
press’s deference to this anodyne anonymity, it’s no wonder that
official spokespeople expect this kind of anonymity. I routinely receive
emails from corporate spokespeople disputing my characterization of
their employer’s conduct, but insisting that I not attribute their
dubious – and often blatantly false – statements to them by name. These
are the greater corporate fuckwads, who commit their sins from behind a
veil of anonymity. That brand of bloodless viciousness, depravity and
fraud absolutely depends on anonymity. Mark Zuckerberg claimed that
“multiple identities” enabled bad behavior – as though it was somehow
healthy for people to relate to their bosses, lovers, parents, toddlers
and barbers in exactly the same way. Zuckerberg’s motivation was utterly
transparent: having “multiple identities” doesn’t mean you “lack
integrity” – it just makes it harder to target you for ads. But
Zuckerberg couldn’t enshittify Facebook on his own. For that, he relies
on a legion of anonymous Facebook managers. Some of these people
undoubtably speak up for Facebook users’ interests when their colleagues
propose putting them in harm’s way for the sake of some arbitrary KPI.
But the ones who are making those mean little decisions? They absolutely
rely on anonymity to do their dirty work. Hey look at this (permalink)

id="apple-fined-nearly-2-billion-by-european-union-over-music-streaming-competition">Apple
Fined Nearly $2 Billion by European Union Over Music Streaming
Competition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty
against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion
for breaking the bloc’s competition laws by unfairly favoring its own
music streaming service over rivals.</p>
<p>Apple banned app developers from “fully informing iOS users about
alternative and cheaper music subscription services outside of the app,”
said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top
antitrust enforcer.</p>
<p>“This is illegal, and it has impacted millions of European
consumers,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said
at a news conference.</p>
<p>Apple behaved this way for almost a decade, which meant many users
paid “significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions,”
the commission said.</p>
<p>The 1.8 billion-euro fine follows a long-running investigation
triggered by a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five
years ago.</p>
<p>The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies,
including a series of multbillion-dollar fines for Google and charging
Meta with distorting the online classified ad market. The commission
also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple’s mobile
payments service.</p>
<p>Apple hit back at both the commission and Spotify, saying it would
appeal the penalty.</p>
<p>“The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover
any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a
market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company
said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said Spotify stood to benefit from the decision, asserting that
the Swedish streaming service that holds a 56% share of Europe’s music
streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store met 65
times with the commission over eight years.</p>
<p>“Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just
cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is
the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said.</p>
<p>The commission’s investigation initially centered on two concerns.
One was the iPhone maker’s practice of forcing app developers that are
selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which
charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.</p>
<p>But the EU later dropped that to focus on how Apple prevents app
makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for
subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app.</p>
<p>The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from
telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their
apps, including links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions
or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options.</p>
<p>The fine comes the same week that new EU rules are set to kick in
that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital
markets.</p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set
of do’s and don’ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta,
Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of
hefty fines.</p>
<p>The DMA’s provisions are designed to prevent tech giants from the
sort of behavior that’s at the heart of the Apple investigation. Apple
has already revealed how it will comply, including allowing iPhone users
in Europe to use app stores other than its own and enabling developers
to offer alternative payment systems.</p>
<p>The commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation
into Apple’s mobile payments service, and the company has promised to
open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals in order to
resolve it.</p>

<p>
Regional lender New York Community Bancorp has already had a rocky year
so far and recently replaced its CEO following revelations of “material
weaknesses.” NYCB acquired nearly $40 billion in assets last year from
the failing Signature Bank, and that rapid growth can make it hard for
internal controls to keep up. Also, a federal judge in Alabama struck
down an anti-money-laundering law. And interest rates aren’t included in
inflation calculations. What gives?

<h2 id="llm-prompt-injection-worm">LLM Prompt Injection Worm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Researchers have
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized">demonstrated</a>
a worm that spreads through prompt injection.
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/">Details</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email
including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of
an email assistant using
<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG)</a>, a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside
its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a
user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it
“jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the
emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive
user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email
sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,”
Nassi says…

<h2 id="a-carbon-tax-is-back-on-the-table">A Carbon Tax Is Back on the
Table</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYwNzE1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTExOTEyNX0.WqATgTMfy6-x4C7spjH1BZ_7kwglqT_E5CdReac8t7Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Climate policy has been all over the place lately thanks to pressure
from interest groups, pre-election jitters, and the plausibility of a
re-elected President Donald Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_blank">laying
waste</a> to existing climate policy.
</p>
<p>
But further in the future, beyond the ups and downs of electoral
politics, there’s a policy cataclysm coming that, some hope, could
create an opening for that long sought, always denied dream of climate
policy: the carbon tax.
</p>
<p>
Let’s back up. There are two things happening that might free up this
policy space, one domestic, and the other overseas. At the end of 2025,
much of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, otherwise known as
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Trump tax cuts</a>, will expire, including several provisions that many
in Congress will want to extend, including lower income tax rates, a
higher standard deduction and personal exemption, and an expanded child
tax credit.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, much of the revenue that helped pay for those tax cuts
— such as limitations on deductions for mortgage interest and state and
local taxes — will also expire.
</p>
<p>
Measures that reduce taxes tend to be popular and those that raise them
tend
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
to be</a>, and that’s as true with the Trump tax cuts as with anything.
(Since basically the day the TCJA passed, there’s been intense
bipartisan opposition to the limitation on deductions for state and
local taxes, for example.) That they’re expiring all at the same time
will create a policy free for all.
</p>
<p>
And just as the Trump tax cuts expire, the European Union’s Carbon
Border Adjustment Mechanism will come into full effect in January 2026,
complementing its existing cap-and-trade and carbon pricing system.
Essentially, CBAM is a tariff on imports from countries that don’t price
carbon the same way the EU does, and it’s designed to prevent what’s
known as “leakage,” where producers in countries with a carbon price
simply offshore emissions-intensive production to countries that don’t.
(It also helps make sure those products from other countries aren’t able
to undercut domestic producers on price, a facet of the policy some have
pooh-poohed as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-brazil-eu-carbon-tax" target="_blank">protectionist</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Starting last year, EU trading partners had to begin reporting the
carbon content of some emissions-intensive exports in preparations for
payments starting in 2026. One of those trading partners is the United
States, which exports some
<a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions#:~:text=The%20top%20five%20purchasers%20of,United%20Kingdom%20(%2476.2%20billion)." target="_blank">$351
billion worth of goods</a> to the EU, second only to Canada.
</p>
<p>
Bills that would just address the carbon price gap have been proposed
several times in the current Congress, including by climate stalwart and
Democrat from Vermont, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, plus some Republicans
who think America should get an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/foreign-pollution-fee-act-of-2023-lindsey-graham-bill-cassidy" target="_blank">advantage
over China</a> for having a less carbon-intensive manufacturing sector.
</p>
<p>
This all creates a kind of celestial alignment in favor of a policy that
has been rejected so many times (RIP the 2009 cap-and-trade bill and
Bill Clinton’s BTU Tax) — or at least that’s what its advocates hope.
Based on the history of carbon taxation and related polices, you might
be pessimistic. But we haven’t seen a year like 2025.
</p>
<p>
“If you think about carbon price relative to raising people’s income
taxes, when you put it in the whole fiscal conversation that’s going to
happen in 2025, it’s going to look more attractive,” Catherine Wolfram,
a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and former Treasury
official in the Biden administration, told me. Wolfram was also one of
the authors of a paper released last week by the Brookings Institution’s
Hamilton Project
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240227_THP_ClimateTaxPaper.pdf" target="_blank">mapping
out how various climate policies</a> could emerge from the witch’s brew
of TCJA expiring and carbon tariffs would actually effect U.S.
emissions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The paper concluded that of the seven 2025 climate policy options they
considered — including doing nothing to the IRA and enacting planned new
emissions rules, doing nothing to the IRA with no new emissions rules,
repealing the IRA, expanding the IRA tax credits for clean electricity,
instituting a carbon fee starting at $15 a ton, instituting a clean
electricity standard that would mandate a certain portion of electricity
be produced from non-carbon-emitting sources with fees for
noncompliance, and a carbon fee along with repealing some parts of the
IRA — the carbon fee and the clean electricity standard would bring
emissions down by the most, just missing the stated 2030 target.
</p>
<p>
And that’s just U.S. emissions. Wolfram said that if the U.S. were to
institute a carbon fee, it would be a major step towards a worldwide
carbon price, as countries would want to avoid paying fees to both the
U.S. <em>and</em> Europe for pollution-intensive exports. “The more
countries that get in this game,” Wolfram said, “the more powerful that
policy can be.”
</p>
<p>
Whitehouse spoke at a Brookings event last week, saying, “We’ll find out
a lot when people start getting tariffed through the European Union
CBAM,” and that even Republicans were “pricing curious” due to the
specter of carbon tariffs. “The forces are converging on making that
work,” he added about the idea of finally getting a carbon price of our
own.
</p>
<p>
Wolfram is also — cautiously — optimistic. “We haven’t tried since 2009.
That’s 15 years ago,” she said. “The climate continues to change, and
it’s changed pretty dramatically in the last 15 years. I don’t think we
should have too many conclusions about what’s possible.”

Kamala Harris spoke about the crisis in the Middle East with strong
words for both Hamas and Israel, calling for a ceasefire of at least six

it, and negotiators are waiting for a response from Hamas leaders.</p>

The focus of the shot is her earring: there&amp;#39;s an earlobe stud of two hands shaking, and a little silver chain running from that to an ear cuff in the shape of a bunch of stars at the top of her ear.&quot;

Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

id="bill-to-fund-us-government-includes-money-to-counter-china-in-pacific">Bill
to Fund US Government Includes Money to Counter China in Pacific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. congressional negotiators released a bill Sunday
that would fund key parts of the government through the rest of the
fiscal year, which began in October 2023.</p>
<p>Among provisions in the appropriations package are critical funds to
counter China in the Pacific as part of an agreement signed last year
called the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA.</p>
<p>Under the compacts, Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands will
receive $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years. In exchange,
Washington will provide for their defense and can deny China access to
their territorial waters, a maritime area larger than the continental
United States.</p>
<p>The United States has had similar agreements in effect with
Micronesia and the Marshalls since 1986 and with Palau since 1994.
Citizens from these nations are allowed to travel, live and work in the
United States as nonimmigrants.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, who represents the U.S.
territory of American Samoa, told VOA on Sunday that House Speaker Mike
Johnson reached her early Saturday morning to deliver the news.</p>
<p>Radewagen said she then called the presidents of the three Pacific
allies to share the details.</p>
<p>“The COFA agreements send a clear message of U.S. commitment to the
Pacific region and take a much-needed international strong stand for the
ideals of democracy and freedom,” she told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>Senator Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who has long supported the
full funding of the agreement, issued a statement Sunday night.</p>
<p>“As we work to counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific,
these agreements are extremely important for our national security and
that of our allies, and also for the tens of thousands of COFA citizens
who live, work and pay taxes in the U.S.,” she said.</p>
<p>The move comes after 26 senators, including Senators Joe Manchin, a
Democrat, and John Barrasso, a Republican, urged Senate leadership to
include the language that had previously been dropped from a Senate
security spending bill on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>“Failure to act on COFA opens the door to more corrupting influence
and funding by the PRC in the region,” wrote the senators, using an
acronym for the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Pacific Island leaders remain cautious.</p>
<p>President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands spoke to a Remembrance
Day for victims and survivors of nuclear testing on March 1, the 70th
anniversary of the U.S. nuclear test on Bikini Atoll.</p>
<p>“Our nation has been a steadfast ally of the United States, but that
should not be taken for granted,” she told the audience, according to
the news site Islands Business.</p>
<p>Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. told VOA:</p>
<p>“We are heartened that the leaders of both houses of Congress and the
White House have reached a consensus on the legislation slated for
action this week. We thank our friends in both parties for their
continued support and partnership.”</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers face another threat of a partial shutdown if they fail
to act by midnight Friday.</p>
<p>House Speaker Johnson has said he will bring the compromise bill to
the floor for a full house vote on Wednesday.</p>

id="netanyahu-rival-visits-us-signals-wider-cracks-in-israels-wartime-leadership">Netanyahu
Rival Visits US, Signals Wider Cracks in Israel’s Wartime
Leadership</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuked a top
Cabinet minister arriving in Washington on Sunday for talks with U.S.
officials, according to an Israeli official, signaling widening cracks
within the country’s leadership nearly five months into its war with
Hamas.</p>
<p>The trip by Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival who joined
Netanyahu’s wartime Cabinet following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, comes as
friction between the U.S. and Netanyahu is rising over how to alleviate
the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and what the postwar plan for the
enclave should look like.</p>
<p>An official from Netanyahu’s far-right Likud party said Gantz’s trip
was planned without authorization from the Israeli leader. The official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu had a “tough
talk” with Gantz and told him the country has “just one prime
minister.”</p>
<p>Gantz is scheduled to meet Monday with U.S. Vice President Kamala
Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Tuesday with
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to his National Unity
Party. A second Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity
said Gantz’s visit is intended to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster
support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli
hostages.</p>
<p>In Egypt, talks were underway to broker a cease-fire before the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week.</p>
<p>Israel did not send a delegation because it is waiting for answers
from Hamas on two questions, according to a third Israeli government
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Israeli media reported
that the government is waiting to learn which hostages are alive and how
many Palestinian prisoners Hamas seeks in exchange for each.</p>
<p>All three Israeli officials spoke anonymously because they weren’t
authorized to discuss the disputes with the media.</p>
<p>The U.S. began airdrops of aid into Gaza on Saturday, after dozens of
Palestinians rushing to grab food from an Israel-organized convoy were
killed last week. The airdrops circumvented an aid delivery system
hobbled by Israeli restrictions, logistical issues and fighting in Gaza.
Aid officials say airdrops are far less effective than deliveries by
truck.</p>
<p>U.S. priorities in the region have increasingly been hampered by
Netanyahu’s Cabinet, which is dominated by ultranationalists. Gantz’s
more moderate party at times acts as a counterweight.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s popularity has dropped since the war broke out, according
to most opinion polls. Many Israelis hold him responsible for failing to
stop the Oct. 7 cross-border terror attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200
people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 people as hostages into
Gaza, including women, children and older adults, according to Israeli
authorities.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began,
around two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run
Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and
fighters. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million have fled their
homes, and U.N. agencies say hundreds of thousands are on the brink of
famine.</p>
<p>Israelis critical of Netanyahu say his decision-making has been
tainted by political considerations, a charge he denies. The criticism
is particularly focused on plans for postwar Gaza. Netanyahu wants
Israel to maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with
Palestinians running civilian affairs.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants to see progress on the creation of a Palestinian
state, envisioning a revamped Palestinian leadership running Gaza with
an eye toward eventual statehood.</p>
<p>That vision is opposed by Netanyahu and the hard-liners in his
government. Another top Cabinet official from Gantz’s party has
questioned the handling of the war and the strategy for freeing the
hostages.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s government, Israel’s most conservative and religious
ever, has also been rattled by a court-ordered deadline for a new bill
to broaden military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many of them are
exempt from military service so they can pursue religious studies.
Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, and the
military is looking to fill its ranks.</p>
<p>Gantz has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood.
Polls show he would earn enough support to become prime minister if a
vote were held today.</p>
<p>A visit to the U.S., if met with progress on the hostage front, could
further boost Gantz’s support.</p>
<p>Israel and Hamas are negotiating over a possible new cease-fire and
hostage release deal. Vice President Harris said Sunday it is now up to
Hamas to agree to it. “Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza,
there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks,
which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Israelis, deeply traumatized by Hamas’ attack, have broadly backed
the war effort as an act of self-defense, even as global opposition to
the fighting has increased.</p>
<p>But a growing number are expressing their dismay with Netanyahu. Some
10,000 people protested late Saturday to call for early elections,
according to Israeli media. Such protests have grown in recent weeks but
remain much smaller than last year’s demonstrations against the
government’s judicial overhaul plan.</p>
<p>If the political rifts grow and Gantz quits the government, the
floodgates will open to broader protests by a public that was already
unhappy with the government when Hamas struck, said Reuven Hazan, a
professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>At least 12 people were killed, including five women and two
children, in an Israeli strike Sunday that hit a house in the Nuseirat
refugee camp in central Gaza, according to an Associated Press
journalist at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. And two Israeli strikes
southwest of Deir al-Balah killed at least five people and destroyed an
aid truck, according to witnesses and staff at the hospital.</p>
<p>Amid concerns about the wider regional conflict, White House senior
adviser Amos Hochstein was going to Lebanon on Monday to meet officials,
according to an administration official who was not authorized to
comment. White House officials want Lebanese and Israeli officials to
prevent tensions along their border from worsening.</p>

id="congressional-leaders-come-out-with-6-spending-bills-in-drive-to-avoid-partial-shutdown">Congressional
Leaders Come Out With 6 Spending Bills in Drive to Avoid Partial
Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Congressional leaders on Sunday came out with a package
of six bills setting full-year spending levels for some federal
agencies, a step forward in a long overdue funding process beset by
sharp political divisions between the two parties as well as infighting
among House Republicans.</p>
<p>The release of the text of legislation over the weekend was designed
to meet the House’s rule to give lawmakers at least 72 hours to study a
bill before voting. And it’s a promising sign that lawmakers will avoid
a partial shutdown that would kick in at 12:01 a.m. Saturday for those
agencies covered under the bill, such as Veterans Affairs, Agriculture,
Transportation, Justice and others.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders hope to complete votes on the package this week
and continue negotiations on the remaining six annual spending bills to
pass them before a March 22 deadline. The price tag for the package out
Sunday comes to about $460 billion, representing less than 30% of the
discretionary spending Congress looks to approve for this year. The
package still being negotiated includes defense spending.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted some key policy and spending
wins for conservatives, even as many of his Republican colleagues
consider the changes inadequate. Some House Republicans had hoped the
prospect of a shutdown could leverage more concessions from
Democrats.</p>
<p>Overall, this year’s spending bills would keep non-defense spending
relatively flat with last year’s bill, despite the rise in inflation,
and some $70 billion less than what President Joe Biden originally
sought.</p>
<p>“House Republicans secured key conservative policy victories,
rejected left-wing proposals, and imposed sharp cuts to agencies and
programs critical to President Biden’s agenda,” Johnson said in a
prepared statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
announced an agreement on the top-line spending levels for this year’s
discretionary spending, which comes to more than $1.6 trillion. But that
agreement didn’t address potential policy mandates placed within the
bills. That’s where negotiations have focused in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Democrats staved off most of the policy riders that House Republicans
sought to include. For example, they beat back an effort to reverse the
FDA’s decision that allows the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in
retail pharmacies, instead of only in hospitals, clinics and medical
offices. Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition
program for low-income women, infants and children known as WIC,
providing about $7 billion for the program, a $1 billion increase from
the previous year.</p>
<p>“Throughout the negotiations, Democrats fought hard to protect
against cuts to housing and nutrition programs and keep out harmful
provisions that would further restrict access to women’s health or roll
back the progress we’ve made to fight climate change,” Schumer, said in
support of the legislation.</p>
<p>House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One
provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to China.</p>
<p>Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. Under
current law, the VA must send a beneficiary’s name to the FBI’s National
Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is
appointed to help manage someone’s benefits. This year’s spending
package prohibits the VA from transmitting that information unless a
relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to
himself or herself, or others.</p>
<p>Still, some of the more conservative members of the House Republicans
have been critical of the spending bills, and many voted against the
short-term extension Congress passed last week that avoided a shutdown
and allowed negotiations to continue.</p>
<p>“We all promised we wouldn’t do this crap when we got up here,”
Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said as the short-term extension was
debated. “The American people have demanded responsible spending and
border security for years, but we fail them. When will we heed the calls
of our constituents to rein in the wasteful spending, secure the
borders, and defeat the bureaucracy targeting them?”</p>
<p>The short-term extension last week was the fourth in recent months.
The vote to approve it was 320-99, but House Republicans were divided,
with 113 in support and 97 against. The Senate approved the extension,
77-13.</p>
<p>The votes being teed up on spending bills come five months after the
budget year began.</p>

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.8-released">pg_ivm 1.8 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm
1.8</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.7 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple
was inserted even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of
inserting a tuple into a table in an EXISTS subquery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma
Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)
</p>
<p>
Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is
installed by shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening
the index on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been
already dropped at that time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

of inmates flee after armed gangs storm Haiti’s main prison, leaving
bodies behind</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>Hundreds of inmates have fled Haiti’s main prison after armed gangs
stormed the facility overnight in an overnight explosion of violence
that engulfed much of the capital. At least five people are dead. The
jailbreak marks a new low in Haiti’s downward spiral of violence. It
comes as gangs assert greater control in the capital, Port-au-Prince,
while Prime Minister Ariel Henry is abroad trying to salvage support for
a United Nations-backed security force. Authorities have yet to provide
an account of what happened. The leader of a nonprofit that works in the
prison says fewer than 100 of the nearly 4,000 inmates remain behind
bars. Family members have rushed to check on loved ones.</p>

leaders come out with 6 spending bills in a drive to avoid a partial
shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>Congressional leaders have come out with a package of six bills
setting full-year spending levels for some federal agencies. The move
Sunday is a step forward in a long overdue funding process beset by
sharp political divisions between the two parties as well as infighting
among House Republicans. The release of the text of legislation over the
weekend is designed to meet the House’s rule to give lawmakers at least
72 hours to study the bill before voting on it. And it’s a promising
sign that lawmakers will avoid a partial shutdown that would kick in at
12:01 a.m. Saturday for those agencies covered under the bill.</p>

up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

id="supreme-court-decision-expected-soon-in-colorados-trump-2024-ballot-case">Supreme
Court Decision Expected Soon in Colorado’s Trump 2024 Ballot Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Supreme Court decision could come as soon as Monday in
the case about whether former President Donald Trump can be kicked off
the ballot over his efforts to undo his defeat in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump is challenging a groundbreaking decision by the Colorado
Supreme Court that said he is disqualified from being president again
and ineligible for the state’s primary, which is Tuesday.</p>
<p>The resolution of the case Monday, a day before Super Tuesday
contests in 16 states, would remove uncertainty about whether votes for
Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, will ultimately
count. Both sides had requested fast work by the court, which heard
arguments less than a month ago, on Feb. 8,</p>
<p>The Colorado court was the first to invoke a post-Civil War
constitutional provision aimed at preventing those who “engaged in
insurrection” from holding office. Trump also has since been barred from
primary ballot in Illinois and Maine, though both decisions, along with
Colorado’s, are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court
case.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has until now never ruled on the provision, Section
3 of the 14th amendment.</p>
<p>The court indicated Sunday there will be at least one case decided
Monday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also
departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the
expectation that it’s the Trump ballot case that will be handed
down.</p>
<p>Except for when the end of the term nears in late June, the court
almost always issues decisions on days when the justices are scheduled
to take the bench. But the next scheduled court day isn’t until March
15. And apart from during the coronavirus pandemic when the court was
closed, the justices almost always read summaries of their opinions in
the courtroom. They won’t be there Monday.</p>
<p>Any opinions will post on the court’s website beginning just after 10
a.m. EST Monday.</p>
<p>Separately, the justices last week agreed to hear arguments in late
April over whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted on election
interference charges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on
the U.S. Capitol. The court’s decision to step into the politically
charged case, also with little in the way of precedent to guide it,
calls into question whether Trump will stand trial before the November
election.</p>
<p>The former president faces 91 criminal charges in four prosecutions.
Of those, the only one with a trial date that seems poised to hold is
his state case in New York, where he’s charged with falsifying business
records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. That
case is set for trial on March 25, and the judge has signaled his
determination to press ahead.</p>

there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths

programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,

<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a
point; OpenAI, Altman and Brockman <em>have</em> changed their mission
since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation
shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable
and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding
provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific
purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,
development and distribution of technology related to artificial
intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the
corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit
when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain
of any person.</p>

id="vice-president-harris-leads-bloody-sunday-march-says-fight-for-voting-rights-goes-on">Vice
President Harris Leads Bloody Sunday March, Says Fight for Voting Rights
Goes On</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SELMA, Alabama — Vice President Kamala Harris told thousands gathered
for the 59th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday attacks on civil rights
marchers in Selma, Alabama, that fundamental freedoms, including the
right to vote, are under attack in America even today.</p>
<p>Harris joined those gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge,
where voting rights activists were beaten back by law enforcement
officers in 1965. The vice president praised the marchers’ bravery for
engaging in a defining moment of the civil rights struggle.</p>
<p>“Today, we know our fight for freedom is not over, because in this
moment we are witnessing a full on attack on hard-fought, hard-won
freedoms, starting with the freedom that unlocks all others, the freedom
to vote,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She criticized attempts to restrict voting, including limits on
absentee voting and early voting, and said the nation is again at a
crossroad.</p>
<p>“What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a
country of freedom, liberty and justice? Or a country of injustice, hate
and fear?” Harris asked, encouraging people to answer with their
vote.</p>
<p>She paid tribute to the civil rights marchers who walked across the
bridge in 1965 knowing they would face certain violence in seeking “a
future that was more equal, more just and more free.”</p>
<p>Decisions by the Supreme Court and lower courts since 2006 have
weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was passed in the wake of
the police attacks in Selma. The demonstrators were beaten by officers
on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, as they tried to march
across Alabama to support voting rights.</p>
<p>Harris drew parallels between those who worked to stifle the Civil
Rights Movement and “extremists” she said are trying to enact
restrictions on voting, education and reproductive care.</p>
<p>She said other fundamental freedoms under attack include “the freedom
of a woman to make decisions about her own body,” a reference to state
abortion bans. She also stressed the Biden administration’s support for
a six-week ceasefire in Gaza to “get the hostages out and a significant
amount of aid in.”</p>
<p>Under a blazing blue sky, Harris then led the crowd across the Edmund
Pettus Bridge in the march that concludes the annual commemoration.
Thousands followed, sometimes singing hymns and anthems of the Civil
Rights Movement including, “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round.”</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at a Selma
church service marking the anniversary of the attack by Alabama law
officers on civil rights demonstrators. He said recent court decisions
and certain state legislation have endangered voting rights in much of
the nation.</p>
<p>“Since those (court) decisions, there has been a dramatic increase in
legislative measures that make it harder for millions of eligible voters
to vote and to elect representatives of their choice,” Garland told
worshippers at Selma’s Tabernacle Baptist Church, the site of one of the
first mass meetings of the voting rights movement.</p>
<p>“Those measures include practices and procedures that make voting
more difficult; redistricting maps that disadvantage minorities; and
changes in voting administration that diminish the authority of locally
elected or nonpartisan election administrators,” he said. “Such measures
threaten the foundation of our system of government.”</p>
<p>The march and Garland’s speech were among dozens of events during the
Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee, which began Thursday and culminated
Sunday.</p>
<p>The commemoration is a frequent stop for Democratic politicians
paying homage to the voting rights movement. Some in the crowd gathered
to see Harris speak about the upcoming November election and what
appears to be a looming rematch between President Joe Biden and former
President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Khadidah Stone, 27, part of a crowd gathered at the bridge Sunday in
light rain before the march, said she sees the work of today’s activists
as an extension of those who were attacked in Selma in 1965. Stone works
for the voter engagement group Alabama Forward and was a plaintiff in
the Voting Rights case against the state that led to creating a second
Alabama congressional district with a substantial number of Black
voters. Voters will cast their first ballots in that district on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We have to continue to fight, because they (voting rights) are under
attack,” Stone said.</p>
<p>Nita Hill wore a hat saying “Good Trouble,” a phrase associated with
the late Rep. John Lewis, who was beaten on the bridge during Bloody
Sunday. Hill, 70, said it is important for Biden supporters to vote in
November.</p>
<p>“I believe Trump is trying to take us back,” said Hill, a retired
university payroll specialist.</p>
<p>Decades ago, images of the violence that at the bridge stunned
Americans, which helped galvanize support for passing the Voting Rights
Act of 1965. The law struck down barriers prohibiting Black people from
voting.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina who is leading
a pilgrimage to Selma, said he is seeking to “remind people that we are
celebrating an event that started this country on a better road toward a
more perfect union,” but the right to vote is still not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Clyburn sees Selma as the nexus of the 1960s movement for voting
rights, at a time when there currently are efforts to scale back those
rights.</p>
<p>“The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became a reality in August of 1965
because of what happened on March 7th of 1965,” Clyburn said.</p>
<p>“We are at an inflection point in this country,” he added. “And
hopefully this year’s march will allow people to take stock of where we
are.”</p>

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

https://www.humblebundle.com/books/cory-doctorow-novel-collection-tor-books-books
I’ve been associated with EFF even longer than I’ve been published by
Tor! My first novel came out while I was working EFF’s first-ever booth
at CES. I split my time between the booth and my motel room, where I
paid $0.25/call to dial up to Earthlink’s local number and manage the
launch-day publicity. Over the years, I’ve benefited immensely from
Tor’s editorial and publicity departments, working with brilliant
publishing people like Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Patty Garcia, Dot Lin,
Laura Etzkorn, Elena Stokes, Sarah Reidy, Lucille Rettino, and of
course, Tor founder Tom Doherty. But I like to think that it was a
two-way street. Tor and I have come a long way together on ebooks: most
visibly, they allowed me to publish several novels under Creative
Commons licenses (my first book was the first ever CC book, coming out
just weeks after the licenses themselves launched). As my editor Patrick
Nielsen Hayden said at the time, “Ebooks have the worst
hours-in-meeting-to-dollars-in-revenue ratio of anything in my
publishing career. Why not?” https://craphound.com/down/download/ Just
as important – but less visible – was Tor’s willingness to let me insist
that all my books be published without DRM, meaning that anything you
buy on say, Amazon, can be moved to any reader program if you decide to
start getting your ebooks elsewhere. This worked so well that in 2012,
Tor became the first major publisher in the world to ban DRM on all its
ebooks, flying me, John Scalzi and Charlie Stross to New York City to
announce it this at a big, splashy event at Book Expo America:
https://web.archive.org/web/20130512022634/https://tor.com/blogs/2012/06/tor-books-announces-e-book-store-doctorow-scalzi-a-stross-talk-drm-free
Tor’s unique status as the sole major DRM-free publisher in the world
was well timed! That same year, I curated the very first Humble Ebook
Bundle, which was very top-heavy with Tor titles, and raised more than
$1,000,000 for the writers, publishers and charities associated with it:
https://web.archive.org/web/20121017215636/http://www.humblebundle.com/
That opened the floodgates to a series of Humble Bundles, tempting other
major publishers to dabble with DRM-free, including Simon and Schuster:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-I5QyAfglU And Harpercollins:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHMLfeCrCrE Now, 12 years after that
inaugural Humble Ebook Bundle, I find myself honored by being the
subject of a bundle of my own (it helps that I’ve written a hell of a
lot of books in the intervening years). Included in the bundle are
(nearly) all of my Tor novels and novellas: The Lost Cause; “The
Canadian Miracle” (a Lost Cause story); Red Team Blues; Radicalized;
Walkaway; “Party Discipline” (a Walkaway story); Pirate Cinema; Rapture
of the Nerds (with Charlie Stross); For The Win; Makers; Someone Comes
to Town, Someone Leaves Town; Eastern Standard Tribe, Down and Out in
the Magic Kingdom, Little Brother, Homeland, Attack Surface, and “Lawful
Interception” (a Little Brother story). (The sole exclusion is The
Bezzle, which came out two weeks ago and is already a USA Today national
bestseller!) https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Also
included in the bundle is Poesy the Monster Slayer, my 2020 picture book
for the littlies:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781626723627/poesythemonsterslayer All
these books are delivered as DRM-free epub files. The Bundle runs for
the next three weeks, and the minimum buy-in is $18 – that’s just
$1/book (full retail value is $187). Of course, you can name a higher
price, and, as with all Humble Bundles, you can adjust the final split
to share out the money between me, EFF, and the Humble folks. Hey look

dreaded the rude awakening of cold air in your face, I think I might
have found a trick that can help: swapping a typical bike helmet for .

By David Hegg Every day, as I drive down the hill from home to the busy
avenue that takes me to my study at Grace Baptist Church, I come to a

<p>
Stephen Maseda (letters, Jan. 3) took nine paragraphs to say what I said
in just two sentences (Jan. 13), but there is one fallacy in
Mr. Maseda’s argument. Although religions don’t use “force” to control
their followers (at least not anymore) they do use another “F-word,” and

or mentally. Those who control Biden and the administration are
determined to “fundamentally transform America,” which is the leftist
promise going back to the 2008 presidential campaign. It’s the same […]

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting
the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I
didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the
host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted
to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running
short on hosts and I obviously accepted.
</p>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.
</p>
<h2>
The roundup
</h2>
<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

<h3>
On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer

<blockquote>
<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

Digital relationships
</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

I loved this entry focused on gaming because I personally have so many
great memories that are related to that. The hours spent with three
weirdos—you know who you are—playing co-op games on the PS4 during the
pandemic days will stay with me forever. So many laughs, and so many
great moments.

The four phases

<p>
In the first era, technology was here to catalogue us.<br /> In the

thought-provoking.

Digital Relationships
</h3>

By <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/digital-relationships">Carl
Barenbrug</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.

Digital Relationships

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.

The Technology Mediated Relationships

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.

Oh the People You’ll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://andzuck.com/blog/connections-over-time/">Andrew
Zuckerman</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

<p>
LAN PARTIES! Those were dope. I still remember playing UT99 with a bunch
of people at an improvised LAN party in a garden. And there was pizza.
UT99 and pizza. What more can you ask from life? I should probably look

Digital Relationships Offer Real Hope

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only
the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships
as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity
of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow.
I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best
of both worlds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can
we just stop for a second and appreciate the fact that I’m typing this
while sitting in Italy and you’re reading this somewhere else on the
globe? It’s fucking amazing.

Leaving the corporate web is not enough. Refusing to follow influencers

is the only way to go.

Some of my good friends I still haven’t met! We only communicate online

<blockquote>
<p>
Others, I’ve gotten to know in real life. And it’s a wonderful sensation
when you meet someone for the first time in a pub and the usual “getting
to know a stranger” feeling isn’t there at all. We would continue the
discussions we’ve had for years without a hitch.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It really is incredible how normal it feels when you finally meet
someone in person. Probably 2 hours after having met Rob in person we
were wandering the woods chasing howls as if that’s the most normal
thing to do with someone you only just met. But it was perfectly normal
because we were friends. And we still are.

<blockquote>
<p>
But it all starts on the internet, on the old independent web, where
there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and
can’t see. It all starts there but it all continues somewhere else. It
continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app
we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up
a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I
moved and I finally have a home I’m gonna do just that.

Belonging and connecting are battles between in-person and screen time.
I struggle to balance digital and in-person interaction; as I push
myself to live in the present, connecting with someone digitally lets me
sometimes feel I’m not since I’m somewhere else with my mind.

I think this is something we as a society have to confront at some
point. Especially with younger generations growing up so connected. The
struggle is real and it is a struggle. And we have to do something about
it.

I believe that co-writing is an excellent practice for long-term
relationship partners. It can keep things fresh and exciting, allowing
you to literally fall in love all over again with someone you’ve been
married to for ten years. More than once I’ve seen something we’re
writing reflect back to me something I’ve been thinking about but not
been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a
relief.

This was such a fascinating read into something I never even thought it
was a thing that people do. And this is why I love the web. It allows me

<p>
You do you sir! Jokes aside, tech is a blessing and a curse. Especially
when it becomes unmanageable. And sometimes I think the only solution to
tech problems is more tech. Which is silly but it’s a silly world the

<p>
As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is
strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I
shouldn’t rely on technology so much. I shouldn’t be so materialistic or
be so attached. But when you spend that much time during some of your
most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound
to become sentimental.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I
can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch
I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this
post made me want to go back to working on a laptop, something I’m
missing these days.

things like “Digital” or “IRL” but those don’t fully capture the spirit

Digital Relationships; or, How I Met My Wife and Why I Might Not Try

<p>
I am careful to remember that you too are just a voice in the dark. We
have never spoken. We have never shared a meal together. We have never
shaken hands or embraced. We have never stood side by side against a
common enemy with our actual and only lives at stake. As tempting as it
is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without
bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we
forge should take that into account.

I love Matthew’s post. As I said to him, his story reminds me of mine in
a way. Again, maybe I’ll write about it one day.

Digital relationships with our past

<blockquote>
<p>
The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these
experiences, instead of providing them with a ready-made interpretation
or a written text to read or skip. Left alone, immersed in these
soundscapes, we are forced to reflect on our emotions triggered by sound
and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past
and with the archaeological site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I very much enjoyed this entry because it tackles a completely different
type of digital relationship, one I never spent time thinking about. I’m
now so intrigued by the concept of digital archeology.

<p>
Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /
relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It
is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that sometimes not having access to non-verbal communication can
be a good thing. You’re forced to focus on the actual message because
that’s all you have.

<p>
All good things come to an end. People moved on as the platform
struggled with some technology changes and my online life once again
reverted to the mainstream social networks, meaning news consumption on
Twitter and sharing posts with real world contacts via Facebook and
WhatsApp.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is one of the sad truths about the web in general and why I also
think personal sites are the best way to stay online: platforms come and
go. The only place you can count on still being there in 10 or 15 years
is the one you control.

<p>
The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were
about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became
something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything.
What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The fact that people managed to build careers out of being active on
social platforms is one of the big tragedies of the modern web.

Websites as a catalyst for personal relationships

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the dominating platforms of today, nobody will ever be a citizen, not
even a customer. We’re only good enough to be a user. But outside of the
walled gardens, there are still ample opportunities. We can form
relationships, participate in debate, cultivate a corner of and shape
the digital medium. All these verbs - nota bene - have in common that
they are active.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s why I always encourage people to write publicly but to also email
others and create connections. The open web requires effort but it will
also reward you for doing so.

<p>
What is wild to me, is how many of these projects are managed on a

open source software, most projects are primarily one person spending
their free evenings trying to understand the questions people submit and
make the project better for everyone.
</p>

<p>
It’s incredible how much of the web is the result of a relatively small
number of people spending their free time working on projects for the
simple fact that they care about this platform.

<p>
on large social media, everything is drowned out, compacted, an endless
stream, which, even without technical limits causes more compactness,
which causes more abstractions. Meanwhile, forums tend to lend
themselves to more long-form communications. And to compound on that
previous point, on social media a true conversation is nearly
impossible, always getting drowned out.

That’s why I left social media long ago. I found it more performative
than social.

<p>DENVER, Colorado — U.S. ski areas lost $5 billion from 2000 to 2019
as a result of human-caused climate change and could lose around $1
billion annually in the 2050s depending on how much emissions are
reduced, a new study found.</p>
<p>People “may not care about the loss of the species halfway around the
world, or a flood that’s happening in some other part of the world. But
sport is often something people care about,” said Daniel Scott, a
scientist at the University of Waterloo and study co-author. “And they
can see some of these changes happening.”</p>
<p>Warm weather has upended winter recreation across North America and
Europe this year, canceling a 402-kilometer dog sled race in Maine,
opening golf courses in Minnesota, and requiring snow saved from the
previous year to run a ski race in Austria. A warm, dry El Niño weather
pattern coupled with global warming is to blame, scientists say, and has
put the threat to winter on center stage.</p>
<p>“It’s a now problem, not a future-looking problem,” said Auden
Schendler, senior vice-president of sustainability at Aspen One, a ski
and hospitality company that helped fund the study, published in Current
Issues in Tourism.</p>
<p>It models what average ski seasons would have looked like from 2000
to 2019 in the four major U.S. markets — the Northeast, Midwest, Rocky
Mountain and Pacific West — without climate change. Its baseline
comparison is ski seasons from 1960 to 1979 — a period when most ski
areas were operating and before significant trends of human-caused
warming began. It found the average modeled season between 2000 and 2019
was shorter by 5.5 to 7.1 days, even with snowmaking to make up for less
natural snow.</p>
<p>Under an optimistic emissions reduction scenario, the future of the
U.S. ski industry would see seasons shortened by 14 to 33 days in the
2050s, even with snowmaking. A high-emissions scenario would nearly
double the days lost.</p>
<p>Countries meeting for annual climate talks agreed in December that
the world needs to be “transitioning away” from the fossil fuels that
are heating the planet to dangerous levels, but set no concrete targets
for doing so. Earth last year had its hottest year on record, and
monthly records have continued this year.</p>
<p>“The future of the ski industry, if that’s something you care about,
is really in our hands and it will play out over the next 10 to 15 years
in terms of the policies and actions that we take to reduce emissions,”
Scott said.</p>
<p>The researchers calculated economic losses based on increased
operating costs for snowmaking along with lost skier revenue. Scott
called the estimates “probably somewhat conservative,” noting that they
don’t include such things as the loss of money that skiers spend on
goods and services in winter sport communities.</p>
<p>The researchers said they undertook the study in part to fill a void
in good data about how much climate change was costing the ski industry.
They also suggested such data would be needed if the industry pursued
lawsuits against fossil fuel producers, citing as a precedent ongoing
litigation by several Colorado communities that are suing oil companies
ExxonMobil and Suncor Energy for the cost of adapting to the impacts of
climate change.</p>
<p>The researchers wrote that snowmaking is “no longer able to
completely offset ongoing climate changes” and said “the era of peak ski
seasons has likely passed in most U.S. markets.”</p>
<p>David Robinson, a Rutgers University researcher and the New Jersey
state climatologist, made the same point as he called the study
interesting and solid.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to stop snowing,” said Robinson, who wasn’t involved
in the work. But “things such as snowmaking are only going to be able to
go so far where it’s being done now” as the planet continues to
warm.</p>
<p>Julienne Stroeve, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice
Data Center, who also wasn’t involved in the work, said the study
doesn’t address how skiers and snowboarders might respond to declining
quality of the snow that does fall. She wondered whether skier behavior
will change if poor snow conditions become more frequent.</p>
<p>That change in skier behavior is known as substitutability, Scott
said. If skiing isn’t an option or doesn’t provide good snow conditions,
will people travel to another ski area? Turn to mountain biking? Scott
said he would like to find out.</p>
<p>“That’s another one of those things we’d love to know more about,
because then you could improve the modeling,” he said.</p>

Change, Cost and Competition for Water Drive Tribal Settlement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — A Native American tribe with one of the largest
outstanding claims to water in the Colorado River basin is closing in on
a settlement with more than a dozen parties, putting it on a path to
piping water to tens of thousands of tribal members in Arizona who still
live without it.</p>
<p>Negotiating terms outlined late Wednesday include water rights not
only for the Navajo Nation but the neighboring Hopi and San Juan
Southern Paiute tribes in the northeastern corner of the state. The
water would come from a mix of sources: the Colorado River that serves
seven western states, the Little Colorado River, and aquifers and washes
on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The agreement is decades in the making and would allow the tribes to
avoid further litigation and court proceedings, which have been costly.
Navajo officials said they expect to finalize the terms in the coming
days.</p>
<p>From there, it must be approved by the tribe’s governing bodies, the
state of Arizona, the other parties and by Congress.</p>
<p>“We have the right Congress, we have the right president, and it’s
very hopeful,” Navajo President Buu Nygren told The Associated Press on
Wednesday. “Because next year might be a whole different ballgame. It’s
going to be very uncertain.”</p>
<p>The proposal comes as Native American tribes, states in the Colorado
River basin and Mexico are working on a long-term plan to share a
diminishing water source that has served 40 million people. Tribes,
including the Navajo Nation, were left out of a landmark 1922 treaty
that divided the water in the basin among seven states.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation has long argued that states treat the tribe as an
afterthought. Any settlement reached would be separate from that
long-term plan and stand on its own.</p>
<p>About one-third of the homes on the Navajo Nation do not have running
water. Infrastructure projects outlined by the Navajo Nation include a
$1.7 billion pipeline to deliver water from Lake Powell to tribal
communities. The caveat being that there is no guarantee that Congress
will provide the funding.</p>
<p>Both the Navajo and Hopi tribes are seeking the ability to lease
water and to store it in existing or new reservoirs and
impoundments.</p>
<p>“Some of our families that still live within those communities still
have to haul water to cook their food, to make lemonade in the summer
for their kids, to make ice, all little simple things to make your daily
life easy and convenient,” Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne
Curley said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Navajo Nation cited climate change, cost,
competition for water and the coronavirus pandemic as reasons to move
toward a settlement. Arizona, in turn, would benefit by having certainty
over the amount of water that is available to non-tribal users. The
state has had to cut its use of Colorado River water in recent years
because of drought and demand.</p>
<p>Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water
Resources, said Wednesday that while progress is being made on a
settlement with the Navajo Nation, the agreement isn’t complete.</p>
<p>Sarah Langley, a spokeswoman for Flagstaff, the largest city that is
a party to the settlement, said it is hopeful the negotiations are
productive.</p>
<p>Arizona — situated in the Colorado River’s Lower Basin with
California, Nevada and Mexico — is unique in that it also has an
allocation in the Upper Basin. Under the settlement terms, Navajo and
Hopi would get about 47,000 acre-feet in the Upper Basin — nearly the
entire amount that was set aside for use at the Navajo Generating
Station, a coal-fired power plant on the Navajo reservation that shut
down in late 2019.</p>
<p>The proposal also includes about 9,500 acre-feet per year of
lower-priority water from the Lower Basin for both tribes. An acre-foot
of water is roughly enough to serve two to three U.S. households
annually.  </p>
<p>While the specific terms for the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe
remain under discussion, Congress could be asked to establish a small
reservation for the tribe whose ancestral land lies in Utah and Arizona.
The tribe’s president, Robbin Preston Jr., didn’t immediately respond to
emailed questions from the AP.</p>
<p>The Hopi Tribe’s general counsel, Fred Lomayesva, declined to
comment.  </p>
<p>The Navajo Nation, whose 27,000 square-mile (70,000 square-kilometer)
reservation also stretches into New Mexico and Utah, already has settled
its claims to the Colorado River basin there.</p>
<p>The Navajo and Hopi tribes came close to reaching a pact with Arizona
to settle water rights in 2012. Both tribes rejected federal legislation
that accompanied it, and the tentative deal fell through. It also wasn’t
broadly supported by Navajos and Hopis who saw negotiations as
secretive, leading to a loose effort to recall then-Navajo President Ben
Shelly and then-Hopi Chairman LeRoy Shingoitewa.  </p>
<p>Recently, the Navajo Nation Water Rights Commission has been holding
public hearings across the reservation to ensure tribal members are
aware of what is involved in a settlement and why the tribe pursued it,
tribal officials said.</p>
<p>“We have a united front to our chapters, our schools and even our
small businesses, families,” Curley said. “It’s inclusive of everyone.
Everybody should be able to know what the terms are.” </p>
<p>The federal government in recent years has poured money into tribal
water rights settlements. The U.S. Supreme Court also ruled the
government does not have a treaty duty to take affirmative steps to
secure water for the Navajo Nation, complicating the tribe’s fight for
water.</p>

<h2 id="blizzard-closes-roads-ski-resorts-in-sierra-nevadas">Blizzard
Closes Roads, Ski Resorts in Sierra Nevadas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TRUCKEE, California — A powerful blizzard that a meteorologist termed
“as bad as it gets” howled in the Sierra Nevada mountains, closing a
long stretch of Interstate 80 in Northern California, forcing ski
resorts to shut down, and leaving thousands of homes without power.</p>
<p>More than 3 meters of snow was expected at higher elevations,
National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said Saturday,
creating a “life-threatening concern” for residents near Lake Tahoe and
blocking travel on the key east-west freeway.</p>
<p>“It’s a blizzard,” said Dubravka Tomasin, a resident of Truckee,
California, for more than a decade. “It’s pretty harrowing.”</p>
<p>Kyle Frankland, a veteran snow-plow driver, said several parts of his
rig broke as he cleared wet snow underneath piles of powder.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in Truckee 44 years. This is a pretty good storm,”
Frankland said. “It’s not record-breaking by any means, but it’s a good
storm.”</p>
<p>Churchill said snow totals by late Sunday would range from 1.5 to 3.6
meters, with the highest accumulations at elevations above 1,500 meters.
Lower elevations were inundated with heavy rain.</p>
<p>He called the storm an “extreme blizzard for the Sierra Nevada, in
particular, as well as other portions of Nevada and even extending into
Utah and portions of western Colorado.” But he said he didn’t expect
records to be broken.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly just about as bad as it gets in terms of the snow
totals and the winds,” Churchill said. “It doesn’t get much worse than
that.”</p>
<p>A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring an additional .3 to .6
meters of snow in the region between Monday and Wednesday next week,
according to the National Weather Service office in Sacramento.</p>
<p>Near Lake Tahoe, Thomas Petkanas, a bartender at Alibi Ale Works in
Incline Village, Nevada, said about 1 meter of snow had fallen by midday
Saturday. He said patrons shook off snow as they arrived at the brewpub
and restaurant.</p>
<p>“It’s snowing pretty hard out there, really windy, and power is out
to about half the town,” Petkanas said by telephone. “We’re one of the
few spots open today.”</p>
<p>Adele Attix said her husband spent the morning clearing their
driveway while she worried about whether she would be able to open her
consignment clothing store in Truckee. She said Saturdays are usually
the busiest day of the week.</p>
<p>“I’d say more than anything, just knowing if we’re going to open or
not has probably caused the most amount of stress,” Attix said. “I
figured I’d come down here and check out the shop.”</p>
<p>Earlier, the weather service warned that blowing snow was creating
“extremely dangerous to impossible” driving conditions, with wind gusts
in the high mountains at more than 160 kph.</p>
<p>Avalanche danger was “high to extreme” in backcountry areas through
Sunday evening throughout the central Sierra and greater Lake Tahoe
area, the weather service said.</p>
<p>California authorities on Friday shut down 160 kilometers of I-80,
the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of “spin outs, high
winds, and low visibility.” There was no estimate when the freeway would
reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant
Gap, California.</p>
<p>Travel was treacherous east of the Sierra, where CalTrans also cited
“multiple spin outs and collisions” and “whiteout conditions,” as it
closed 145 kilometers of U.S. 395 from near Bishop in the Owens Valley
to Bridgeport, north of Mono Lake.</p>
<p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric reported about 7,468 California homes and
businesses without power at 5:56 p.m. NV Energy reported power outages
for about 1,500 customers in parts of northern Nevada, including Incline
Village and Reno.</p>
<p>In southern Nevada the weather service issued a warning Saturday for
high winds gusting to 145 kph. NV Energy reported almost 29,000
customers without power in and around Las Vegas on Saturday, but by that
evening the number had been reduced to about 16,000.</p>
<p>A tornado Friday afternoon in Madera County, California, damaged an
elementary school, said Andy Bollenbacher, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in Hanford.</p>
<p>Some ski resorts shut down Friday and were digging out Saturday with
an eye toward reopening Sunday.</p>
<p>Palisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Tahoe and
site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday because
of snow, wind and low visibility.</p>
<p>Other areas closed Saturday included Sugar Bowl, Boreal and Sierra.
Heavenly Mountain Resort planned to open late with limited
operations.</p>
<p>The storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A blizzard
warning through Sunday morning covers a 480-kilometer stretch of the
mountains.</p>
<p>Some ski lovers raced up to the mountains ahead of the storm.</p>
<p>Daniel Lavely, an avid skier who works at a Reno-area
home/construction supply store, was not one of them. He said Friday that
he wouldn’t have considered making the hour-drive to ski on his season
pass at a Tahoe resort because of the gale-force winds.</p>
<p>But most of his customers Friday seemed to think the storm wouldn’t
be as bad as predicted, he said.</p>
<p>“I had one person ask me for a shovel,” Lavely said. “Nobody asked me
about a snowblower, which we sold out the last storm about two weeks
ago.”</p>
<p>Meteorologists predicted as much as 3 meters of snow was possible in
the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 0.9 to 1.8 meters
in the communities on the lake’s shores and more than 30 centimeters
possible in the valleys on the Sierra’s eastern front, including
Reno.</p>
<p>Yosemite National Park closed Friday. Officials said it would remain
closed through at least noon Sunday.</p>

<a href="/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">a late

notable for what it is than what it has on it: a beta version of System
6.0.6 (the doomed release that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales
databases, two online services — the maligned Mac
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_%28online_service%29">Prodigy</a>

This unit lacks U.S. Federal Communications Commission clearance,
complete with a warning applique that says “ATTENTION! This unit is a
demonstration unit only. It is not for sale or resale. Production units
will comply with all applicable Federal Rules and Regulations.” That
last sentence would imply it isn’t a production unit, meaning it’s not
at PVT stage, but it is clearly more developed than an EVT prototype
would be. Since FCC certification usually occurs after hardware
development is complete but before mass production begins, this makes it
most likely a DVT unit. The only thing that doesn’t work properly on
this machine is the audio, which even after capacitor replacement
remained unusually quiet, though I don’t recall that it ever worked
during its time in my possession.
<p>
I know of a couple other Macintosh Portable prototypes out there in
collector’s hands, though if you’ve got a Mac Portable yourself of any
age, they all hail from that unpleasant turn-of-the-decade era where
virtually all period Apple hardware will require new capacitors
(everything in this one has been completely replaced). The Portable was
not officially released until September 1989 simultaneously with the
Macintosh IIci, where the base 1MB/floppy configuration started at
$5799, or $6499 with one of those loathsome Conner hard disks
(approximately $14,400 and $16,150 respectively in 2024 dollars). That
puts this serial-less unit’s manufacture likely somewhere around spring
’89.
<p>
<p>In architectural terms Apple described the Portable as an evolved
Macintosh SE. Though high performance and with some innovative features,
the Portable’s biggest drawbacks — literally — were its size and its
heavy lead-acid battery, and it sold barely a fifth of what it was
expected to. Apple cancelled it in October 1991.</p>

<p>Naturally, being a pre-production prototype it’s also not a backlit
model — that of course came later — but the 640x400 screen remains
excellent, an early example of an active matrix LCD that Apple boasted
had an individual transistor for every pixel and one of the best
displays on any portable machine from the period. (Sometime in the near
future I’ll dig out my Data General One, a fine example of the
<em>opposite</em> extreme.) It has an Androda 7MB expansion card
<a href="/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">to give it
8MB of RAM</a>, just shy of the 9MB maximum it was capable of
addressing, though no card sold for the Portable back in the day could
achieve this and even the 9MB RAM cap is problematic. This is possibly
due to the lowest motherboard 1MB being shared between ROM and RAM (ROM
overlays it at reset to allow the machine to start even with RAM in a
non-deterministic state), as well as at least one ROM bug that makes
heavily expanded units sluggish when exiting sleep. On the Portable,
which is all about being able to sleep on demand, the phenomenon becomes
most obnoxious with “large” amounts of RAM like this.</p>

<p>We’ll switch at this point to screengrabs instead of photos. Neither
are ideal for our purposes, but although the Portable does have an
external video-out port, that port don’t hunt. Despite being a DE-15
VGA-style connector instead of the expected classic Mac DA-15, you’ll
actually damage it plugging in a VGA display; the lines it exposes are
more or less the same as the LCD drive lines and require conversion. No
presentation module came with this unit and despite Apple’s promises and
various rumours, there is no clear evidence any such adapter was ever
produced for sale by anyone. We can’t get every snapshot since the old
Shift-Command-3 salute only runs when apps yield to the system, but it’s
better than trying to hover over the screen with my Pixel 7 Pro. (System
6 takes screenshots in MacPaint 576x720 format, which I have obviously
reformatted and rotated.)</p>

The specific version of classic Mac OS this machine is running is also
unusual: it’s a beta 12 release of System 6.0.6 (with a beta 6.1.6
Finder), which came out simultaneously with 6.0.5 in March 1990 for
early Macintosh Classic, IIsi and LC machines, but was pulled from
release and replaced with 6.0.7 in September. The problems were
discovered so late in production that it even forced Apple to yank and
reissue the system disk packs shipped with the computers, slapping
“6.0.7” stickers on the label.
<p>
<p>6.0.6 had two major problems, one where AppleTalk was sometimes not
detected when present due to a bug in <tt>Gestalt</tt>, causing
connectivity issues with servers and printers, and another with timing
problems between the LC and IIsi and the ADB Apple Keyboard II, where
the keyboard would intermittently freeze up until the mouse was moved.
However, neither of those problems have manifested on this Portable so
far, and 6.0.6 additionally fixed issues with the Portable’s modem and
reading 800K floppy disks, so you really should run at least 6.0.7 or
6.0.8 (it originally shipped with 6.0.4, also the same as the IIci).</p>

The machine was clearly used for both business and pleasure, at least
through 1991 which was the latest file I could cursorily find. A fair
bit is personal and not generally interesting (and as such I’ve redacted
or put off-screen a few things in these grabs), but it’s proof it
clearly got substantial use, and why not? Slung on a desk, it was a
perfectly cromulent Macintosh with a 16MHz 68000, double that of the
Plus, with a big sharp screen, a high quality keyboard and a nice
trackball. You definitely wouldn’t be using it on your lap, but you
could certainly lug it to and from work.
<p>
<p>That said, I’m not exactly certain where “work” in fact was located.
Interestingly, one application on the hard disk suggests <em>Cleveland,
Ohio</em>, of all places,</p>

<p>… but this might just be who held the site license, and when we get
to AppleLink there’s good evidence that the unit spent most of its time
in Silicon Valley. I know the prior user was an Apple district manager

A related point is its network configuration: the Macintosh network
volume mounted in these shots is my little NetBSD Macintosh IIci (for
moving the grabs off), but it doesn’t seem like it was ever connected to
a network before because the username was originally blank in the
Chooser. After all, it would be odd that other personal stuff and
credentials weren’t removed while the AppleTalk username specifically
had been, so more likely it was never populated in the first place.
<p>
<p>Other relics persist on the hard disk. For example, the HyperCard
stacks introducing users to the Macintosh Portable are also still here,
though they seem to be slightly earlier versions than what got shipped
with production models and have different wording, and the Tour of the
Macintosh Portable app isn’t present. This unit may have predated
it.</p>

<p>I picked two grabs out of it for example’s sake, including the active
matrix display (again, as you saw, it’s really good especially for 1989)
and its CMOS 68HC000 CPU, which was designed by Hitachi and introduced
jointly with Motorola in 1985. Besides reducing power consumption from
1.35W down to about 300mW, it ran at 16MHz in the Portable compared to
its usual Mac speed of around 8MHz (and the part could run as high as
20MHz). Despite the Portable’s substantial development delays it was
nevertheless one of the earliest computers to use it, along with the
original PowerBook 100 which in nearly every respect is a miniaturized
Portable.</p>

<p>For example, this (and a similar image in the <i>Inside</i> stack)
are the only pictures I could find of the video adapter. I don’t know if
this is a mockup or a prototype. There are a couple switches along with
a Mac DA-15 monitor jack and an RCA jack, presumably for composite
output. This device doesn’t seem related at all to the separate and duly
sold Apple Presentation System which was made by Focus and rebadged by
Apple.</p>

<p>But what also caught my eye going through the applications folder was
a suite named POS•IM. The name alone implies this is a point-of-sale
system, divided into applications for accounts receivable, inventory and
sales. I won’t show any real customer records here and I don’t know how
widely deployed this was within the Apple sales channel at that time,
but it probably wouldn’t have been installed at all if there weren’t
some expectation it would be used.</p>

<p>The apps were produced by a Utah company called AnaMatrix. I can’t
find much information on this company and the suite appears to have been
its only product. In <i>MacUser</i> February 1990, it listed for $2500
single-user and $4000 multiuser (in 2024 about $5800 and $9300
respectively), though it was called “POS/IM” with a slash instead of the
interpunct. This installation is the single-user standalone release,
starting here with the accounts receivable application.</p>

current since it didn’t include the IIx (September 1988), but it does
have the SE (March 1987, with the II), dating it likely to the same
year.</p>

<p>The actual invoices themselves were in the third application,
Sales•Point. Parenthetically, a separate menu option for “Transfer”
allowed you to jump between the three apps in the suite if you didn’t
have enough memory to run them simultaneously in MultiFinder, or didn’t
use MultiFinder at all (which would give you all the machine’s available
RAM minus the operating system, as these about boxes show).</p>

You could also run a sales report, but only two came up, “Bill Jones”’
big cash splash included (I’m not sure if there were archives maintained
off-machine).
<p>
<p>That covers billing, inventory and sales, so how about advertising?
For this next part we’re going to spend some time with its copy of Aldus
Persuasion 1.0. Interestingly, PowerPoint beat Persuasion to the
Macintosh by about a year (1987 vs 1988), but Persuasion was for a time
considered the superior product due to its interface, graphing
capabilities and popular outline mode.</p>

<p>Two Aldus Persuasion 1.0 presentations stand out in particular (this
is the copy which I’ve mounted on my Mystic Colour Classic for reasons
I’ll relate in a moment), both of which were official Apple marketing
material at the time. The first is Apple’s then-current product line,
and the second is an early glimpse at the upcoming System 7. Neither
file was apparently Apple-internal or confidential and both seem to have
been regularly presented to potential customers and users.</p>

<p>The Macintosh Product Overview slides have a collective creation and
modification date of October 8, 1989, consistent with the 1989 copyright
the presentation displays. However, its actual origination can be no
<em>later</em> than March 1989 due to the models that it completely
lacks.</p>

<p>No unreleased or upcoming computers are demonstrated or referenced in
this presentation, dividing the existing models simply into two small
“Compact” and “Modular” families. This appears to have been the
manifestation of Macintosh manager Jean-Louis Gassée’s “high-right” goal
which tried to sell high-margin, high-performance machines at the
expense of the “low-left” budget market. Unfortunately for Apple, the
strategy permitted cheaper XT-class PCs to proliferate in Apple’s
relative absence while failing to compete effectively with Unix
workstations at the top. In December 1989 Apple’s stock tanked 20
percent after a dismal holiday sales season and Gassée departed a month
later, but this presentation doesn’t reflect the subsequent product
shakeup that birthed the deliberately low-end Mac Classic and LC.</p>

<p>The long-running Macintosh Plus was still in Apple’s sales list but
got one measly slide, strongly suggesting it was on its way out. The 2MB
and 4MB versions were also completely absent from the presentation so as
not to compete with the SE. Instead, the presenter talked up the SE and
especially the SE/30, putting them head to head and otherwise ignoring
the Plus completely. “Memory Management” refers to the Motorola 68851
MMU, available as an option for the 68020 (but not the 68000), which was
built-in to the SE/30’s 68030 and also slightly faster. The SE/30 came
out in January 1989, so the presentation can’t be any older than
that.</p>

<p>The Modular family, however, only lists two members: the II and the
IIx. This is where the maximum <em>late</em> date of March 1989 comes
in, being when the IIcx was first introduced, the first three-slot II
and the next one in the series. Since it doesn’t appear here, the
presentation can’t be any (or at least much) later than the IIcx’s
formal introduction.</p>

Still, the SE/30 and the IIx were indisputably the stars of this show,
and the most obvious members of the “high-right” family at that time
(early 1989). Other than the slots and form factor, the two systems were
very similar, with the same CPU (with FPU and MMU), same clock speed and
same RAM ceiling.
<p>
<p>The Macintosh Product Overview slideshow was entirely 1-bit black and
white, so I rendered it out to PICTs from the Portable itself for the
most authentic result. However, the System 7 presentation has colour
elements and the Portable doesn’t support Color QuickDraw. For this
section we’ll go back to the Color Classic to render this slide deck,
which I’ve tweaked slightly due to minor differences in font rendering.
(I’m not sure how this particular presentation would have even displayed
properly on the Portable.)</p>

<p>This presentation has a modification and creation date of February 3,
1991. Recall that around March 1988 Apple technical staff made the first
cut of what was planned for System 7 as Blue, with the remainder
becoming Pink (and later Taligent) and Red. This particular presentation
is oriented around Blue’s modest goals (“System 6, corrected,” as
Wikipedia puts it) and doesn’t even mention Pink. However, the
presentation shows a few more primitive or speculative features than
what emerged with System 7.0 in May 1991, one technology in particular
(we’ll discuss) can’t have appeared under that name any later than May
1990, and several 1990 models don’t appear in the support matrix,
putting an upper bound of around March 1990 on when the deck could have
been made or updated. The presentation itself carries a 1989 copyright
on the final slide.</p>

Assuming this wasn’t just a mockup screenshot, the Finder and general
user interface had a number of noticeable differences from the released
version of 7.0. The menu bar has slightly different options in slightly
different order; this earlier version used Color instead of Label, and
the Special menu came before it. System 7’s help icon was also part of
the “menu mass” like Mac OS 8, just with a help diamond, instead of
being an icon off to the side as with Balloon Help.
<p>
<p>Individual Finder windows also appeared differently: the window title
bar is fatter and the detail row is slightly skewed down, not vertically
centred. There are also different icons, including a schematic of the
desktop for the Finder instead of the stylised compact Mac icon used in
System 6 and (with revisions) 7.0, and the Startup Items folder is just
called the Startup Folder with what looks like a placeholder graphic. As
with the final release, the System file remains a suitcase.</p>

<p>System 7 was additionally the début of TrueType, Apple’s outline font
technology and still the dominant font format on most PCs and Macs
(especially given that OpenType is more or less a superset), but the
actual <em>name</em> TrueType appears nowhere in this presentation, nor
do its known codenames Royal and Bass. That doesn’t mean Apple wasn’t
proud of it. Indeed, it was such a big advance over font handling in
System 6 that TrueType was subsequently backported to it, and Apple
granted a license to Microsoft for free to ensure TrueType’s success.
Ironically this was one of the slides I had to tweak on the Color
Classic because the font size of the blurb on the right came out too
large.</p>

<p>System 7 also made MultiFinder mandatory. This screenshot cannot be
contemporary with the Finder screenshot above because the small icon for
the Finder is still System 6’s; that makes this screenshot almost
certainly older, which also explains why the MultiFinder application
list is still in the Apple menu. On the other hand, no desk accessories
are shown in the Apple menu either like one would expect with System 6
MultiFinder, so this is probably truly an early System 7 build assuming

<p>Newly introduced was a varied class of technologies related to
message passing between applications, which is foundational for
higher-level features like scripting and embedding. Apple subsumed these
various features under the umbrella of the Inter-Application
Communications Architecture, or the IAC. These messages could be passed
between applications on the local machine or over a network, using
AppleTalk as the transport. Today we call those messages Apple events,
and the fundamental technology remains part of modern macOS today.</p>

However, one of the IAC features that <em>didn’t</em> succeed was the
Editions Manager, later redacted to the Edition Manager and surfaced to
the user as “Publish and Subscribe.” In this scheme an application could
“publish” part or all of a file that another application could
“subscribe” to (more precisely, a document could have sections in it
called “publishers” connected to “subscriber” sections in other
documents). If this sounds like Microsoft’s Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE), it’s deliberate, as Publish and Subscribe was supposed to be the
OLE killer with non-rectangular regions and update notifications that
could even go over a network — because the notifications were just Apple
events. This has nothing to do
<a href="/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">with
OpenDoc</a>, by the way, which was Apple’s second failed attempt at an
OLE-like technology and uses a completely different internal
architecture.
<p>
The Edition Manager ended up being complicated for developers and
obnoxious for users. Since publication occurred at the section level,
compliant applications had to define what sections existed in a
document, and for those sections that were published write their
contents (termed <i>editions</i>) to an escrow-like repository called an
<i>edition container</i>. On the user end, this felt like doing a
special “cut and paste” from a source into a client document to create a
new section and link it. When the Edition Manager saw updates happen, it
would fire off Apple events to signal subscribers to read that data from
the edition container into their own sections; conversely, when the
Edition Manager saw a subscriber try to read or scroll a section, it
would fire off other Apple events to <em>publishers</em> to remind them
to update.
<p>
<p>None of this work was automatically done by the individual
applications, though, so it wasn’t unusual for publishers to fail to
update their editions or subscribers to fail to retrieve them, or
sometimes for the link to just break completely. I personally remember
screaming at CricketGraph in 1996 trying to get charts in my
undergraduate cognitive science paper within Microsoft Word to actually
show anything, but to this day I still have no idea whose fault that was
(except that it wasn’t mine, dammit). Since the feature was rickety even
in those applications that tried to support it and the level of
developer headache was high, it ended up little used, and when OpenDoc
eclipsed P&amp;S and then fizzled itself, the Edition Manager was
“edited out” (heh heh) of Rhapsody and never implemented for Carbon.</p>

<p>But the part of the IAC that allowed applications to send events to
other applications and manipulate them became a lasting feature. This is
the basic functionality that AppleScript still uses, which is pretty
much all about sending events to apps, and was the basis for the
Program-to-Program Communications Toolbox (PPC Toolbox, unrelated to
PowerPC, which didn’t exist at this point) that underlaid program
linking in System 7 as well. Program linking, in this case, specifically
refers to allowing programs on remote Macs to send events to programs on
yours. This was how you could remotely manipulate server programs
running on other Macs, and was
<a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">ported to AIX
for the Apple Network Server so that “symbiotic applications”</a> could
use the ANS for backend processing: the ANS looked like just another
remote Mac you could send events to via AppleTalk, which the application
on the local Mac could task with jobs and then asynchronously display
their results. In Mac OS 9 TCP/IP became a supported transport for
network Apple events and this capability
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-remote-application-scripting-mchlp1398/mac">remains
part of modern macOS</a> as well.</p>

On the other hand, for sheer obscurity you couldn’t beat CL/1. CL/1 was
short for “Connection Language One” and originally developed by Network
Innovations (unrelated to the current business bearing the name), a
small company founded in 1984 and also based in Cupertino. Based around
SQL but adding control structures for cursors, program logic and
looping, CL/1 was intended for writing desktop-to-host applications to
query remote databases on mainframes and large systems, transforming
CL/1 programs into various SQL subqueries which were collected and
returned. Unlike the later ODBC, most of this processing happened on the
server, reducing network bandwidth but increasing server load and
requiring an “adapter” program specific to the database engine in use.
However, this also meant that client applications could be
straightforward, simply shipping CL/1 programs to the remote server for
execution and not requiring local processing other than the data that
came back.
<p>
<p>As both a practical demonstration and a sellable product, the
company’s first CL/1-based package, appropriately called Mac-to-VAX,
allowed Mac applications to remotely access databases, files and
applications on a DEC VAX server. Released in January 1988, CL/1 could
use AppleTalk, DECnet, X.25, IBM 3270 and Apple’s implementation of IBM
APPC/LU6.2 as transports. Apple was immediately attracted to the
technology, seeing it as both advantageous for the Mac and as a possible
standard they could control, and acquired the company in March as a
subsidiary (its first acquisition of another technology company, as it
happens).

<p>The name CL/1 didn’t last very long after the merger and the last
reference I can find to it in industry sources is around May 1990 when
its new name, Data Access Language (DAL), started appearing. Apple also
scotched Network Innovations’ originally planned ports to PC in 1990,
determining to make DAL at least initially an Apple-exclusive
technology. That said, while this slide implies Apple intended to
include some portion of DAL-née-CL/1 with System 7, only the Data Access
Manager (DAM) API became a built-in part of the operating system; the
extension(s) implementing DAL proper for a given platform seem to have
been a separate install and aren’t on any of my System 7 disk sets. This
is important to distinguish because the DAM just moves prefabricated DAL
queries and replies back and forth and doesn’t implement DAL itself.</p>

Post-System 7, DAL suffered from the intermittent attention span 1990s
Apple exhibited with many of its projects. Its most impressive
application was as an extension for HyperCard, where it facilitated some
remarkable live demos and some of the earliest data-driven fat clients
with full GUIs, causing a scramble by database vendors — notably Oracle
— to implement their own toolkits. (This toolkit started as Format
Verlag’s Plus, became Oracle Card after Oracle’s acquisition, and later
became Oracle Media Objects, best known for the Mac version that ran on
<a href="/2023/07/apples-interactive-television-box.html">the Apple
Interactive Television Box prototype</a>.) While the client side
remained Apple-specific, the server side became impressively
cross-platform, growing to support IBM (VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, MVS/VTAM,
DOS/VSE), DEC (VMS, Ultrix), SVR4, DG/UX, HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Stratus
AOS/VS II and Tandem Guardian C-30, running databases such as SQL/DS,
IBM DB2, Teradata DBC/1012, CA-Datacom, CA-IDMS, Ingres, Informix (the
database I had my first job out of college on), Oracle, Sybase, DEC Rdb,
CA-DB, INFOS II, DG/SQL and Tandem NonStop/SQL. Apple also expanded the
network transport options to include TCP/IP with the growing reach of
the Internet.
<p>
Unfortunately for Apple, development for all these server permutations
was expensive, reflected in very high prices for the adapter component,
and the adapters also tended to incur performance problems largely from
the overhead of translating and running DAL queries which were difficult
to cache. While the concept of shared <i>query documents</i> in the Data
Access Manager was at least in part intended to reduce this impact, few
client applications ended up having much DAL code in common. Although
EveryWare’s ButlerSQL tried to rectify the translation issue by using
DAL as its <em>native</em> language, the most notable of the few that
attempted to do so, it ran on the classic Mac OS and its performance was
instead limited by Mac OS’s poor multitasking and throughput. (Apple was
<a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">well aware of
this problem</a>.) Developers also complained about DAL’s lack of BLOB
and cross-platform support, neither of which Apple did much to address.
Apple did license DAL to Blyth Software to develop a Windows client but
it got little traction or interest.
<p>
<p>Meanwhile, ODBC grew dominant both due to DAL’s technical stagnation
and ODBC’s greater throughput, especially as network bandwidth was
dramatically increasing. Apple licensed DAL to Independence Technologies
(ITI) in February 1994, who intended to release DAL 2.0 supporting blobs
and to take over Windows development, while Apple maintained control of
DAM in Mac OS. ITI got bought itself in 1995 by BEA Systems and sold
again to UniPrise in 1996, but the promised update never emerged before
UniPrise went out of business in 1998. The Data Access Manager, like the
Edition Manager, faded from disuse and was never ported to Rhapsody or
Carbon, and ODBC became the primary database access method even in the
classic Mac OS. However, the TCP port used by DAL — port 172 — remains
as <tt>cl/1</tt> in <tt>/etc/services</tt> to this day.</p>

<p>The other piece enabling us to more precisely date this presentation
is its model support list: the latest models shown are the Macintosh
IIci and the Portable itself, which both came out in September 1989. The
next model in the chronology would have been the IIfx in March 1990,
which doesn’t appear here, so the presentation can’t be later than that.
Notice that the original Macintosh 128K, 512K and 512Ke are listed as
“supported” — but only if you effectively make them into Macintosh
Pluses first.</p>

All this was an “alpha” view of the operating system. The mention of
developer seeding is prominent and intentional; Apple remembered the
incompatibilities that resulted from failing to widely disseminate
System 6 to developers and was determined not to make the same mistake.
This slide anticipated customer availability in “Summer 1990” but System
7.0 was not released until May 1991.

One of the online services on this Portable was the Macintosh client for
<a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/932">Prodigy</a>,
the famous graphical service that used modified NAPLPS graphics as its
user interface. However, I didn’t find any screens in its cache,
suggesting it got hardly any use. Additionally, while Prodigy used
Tymnet’s X.25 dial-in network for its nationwide access, neither of
these numbers appears in
<a href="https://github.com/TYMNET/docs/blob/master/tymnet.txt">the 1990
Tymnet dial-in number list</a>. The main telephone number lacks an area
code, though area code 614 was one of Ohio’s original four area codes in
the North American Numbering Plan encompassing Columbus and most of the
state’s southeast quadrant (Cleveland, for the record, was area code
216). 614 didn’t split until 1998 when most of it became new area code
740.
<p>
<p>These screenshots were done on the Mystic Color Classic in
anticipation of being able to render out some of its <tt>STAGE.DAT</tt>
contents, but there appears to be much less interest and support in the
Prodigy retro-community for the Mac client, and I wasn’t able to get
anything recognizeable out of it. (The different endianness may be only
one of many reasons why.) The low interest is somewhat understandable
since the Mac client wasn’t used much, and the Prodigy interface wasn’t
very Mac-like nor very popular with Macintosh users. Since it doesn’t
look like this person used it much either, we won’t do anything further
with it in this article.</p>

But what our district manager did appear to use is AppleLink, and that’s
where we’ll spend the remainder of our time.

<p>AppleLink was a client-server service for Apple employees and
dealers, and later developers, established in 1985 running over the
General Electric Information Services (GEIS) nationwide Mark III

into America Online; we’ll talk more about that and eWorld, AppleLink’s

E-mail — at least within the network itself — became one of the most
well-known features of AppleLink, including the first E-mail message
sent from space. These are pictures of mission specialists James C.
Adamson and Shannon Lucid with an original non-backlit Macintosh
Portable on
<a href="https://www.wikiarchives.space/index.php?/category/837">NASA
Space Shuttle Mission STS-43</a>, <i>Atlantis</i>’ ninth mission from
August 2 to August 11, 1991. It had been lightly modified with a circuit
breaker on the battery charging system for safety but was otherwise
stock except for some bushings under the trackball to take up slack.
<p>
The Portable was ostensibly transported into space for the purposes of
Development Test Objective (DTO) 1208, Space Station Cursor Control
Device Evaluation II and Advanced Applications, which tested the
in-flight ergonomics of the Portable’s onboard trackball, a 2-inch
external ADB trackball, an ADB optical mouse and a modified aircraft
control stick with a thumb ball hat. While most of the Space Shuttle
laptops were PCs such as ThinkPads (with the notable exception of the
<a href="/2023/01/solbournes-in-space.html">SPARC-based Solbourne
PILOT</a>), the Portable was selected for this objective because it had
a larger variety of commercially available input devices. The Portable
was also used to record data from the Lower Body Negative Pressure
experiment (LBNP, DSO 478), in which the astronauts evaluated use of the
LBNP unit for drawing body fluids down to their legs to reverse
counterflow under weightlessness, as well as shuttle flight path
tracking using a custom application called MacSPoC (“SPoC” being short
for “Shuttle Portable Computer”) and acting as an alarm clock and
scheduler. This latter function was assisted by a
<a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/huh-a-seiko-apple-smart-watch-is-set-to-hit-the-auction-block">Seiko
WristMac</a> “databank” watch which downloaded reminders from the
Portable to its 2K memory.
<p>
It’s not clear whose idea the “space E-mail” was, but it was publicized
by Apple as early
<a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/07/29/applelink-in-space/">as July
1991</a> as a means for astronauts to communicate with family and
exchange files and data. The Earthbound side was GEIS’s regular
packet-switched network (more about that in a moment) fed into a ROLM
telephone switch, terminating in a data linkup to a ground-based Mac
Portable via the printer port at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas. Apple wrote a “forwarder” which took those packets and sent them
back out through the modem port to an actual modem whose signal was then
digitized, bounced off a commercial satellite to the White Sands (New
Mexico) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, and finally sent to a
TDRSS satellite geosynchronous with Shuttle Atlantis. On the Shuttle
side, the spacecraft received the signal as digital data and fed it as
an analogue signal into an onboard modem connected to the Mac Portable.
The same convoluted process in reverse handled injecting packets from
the spacebound Mac Portable back into the GEIS network. From the point
of view of the Mark III, this was just another packet-switched remote
node, albeit one with an incredible amount of latency. Latency wasn’t
something that the stock AppleLink <em>client</em> handled well,
however, so a modified version of AppleLink 6.0.2 went up with the
Portable that had been tweaked to tolerate transmission delays.
<p>
The connection took several tries but Adamson and Lucid were able to
successfully sent the first E-mail from space on August 9, to shuttle
communicator Marcia Ivins at the JSC. The exact message contents
<a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/08/19/mac-in-space-ii/">vary</a>
between
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216055859/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA30635">sources</a>,
but in general the message read, in its entirety,
<p>
<div class="tx" style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">
<p>Hello Earth ! Greetings from the STS-43 Crew. This is the first
AppleLink from space. Having a <strong>GREAT</strong> time, wish you
were here,… send cry[o], and [R]CS! Have a nice day…… Haste la vista,
baby,… we’ll be back!</p>
</div>
<p>
where “cry” or “cryo” refers to cryogenics (in this case, liquid oxygen
for breathing), and “CS” or “RCS” refers to the Reaction Control System,
i.e., fuel for thruster manoeuvres. The shuttle was able to receive
E-mail as well but this address was kept secret from the public (and
various obvious honeypots also set up) to prevent the astronauts from
being deluged.
<p>
<p>That brings us to attempting to log in ourselves, and for that we
should talk briefly about the backend this time. GEIS’ roots extend to
the 1962 Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), a proposal by Dartmouth
College professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz to develop a free, open
timesharing system for students. Kemeny and Kurtz established a
partnership with General Electric in 1963 and got funding from the
National Science Foundation to deploy a 1961 GE-225 mainframe for
processing, a 20-bit system with a typical eight kilowords of core
memory, paired with an 18-bit GE DATANET-30 (“DN-30”) connected via DMA
functioning as a terminal server. The DN-30 was itself a full general
purpose computer but in this application it was fully dedicated to the
task of scheduling jobs on the mainframe and servicing terminals, of
which it could support up to 128. This double-system concept was
considered unusual and even wasteful for the time, but by the autumn of
1964 the system was operating twenty terminals serving hundreds of users
and upgraded seamlessly to a larger GE-235 with triple the memory speed.
This first incarnation of DTSS was the system Kemeny and Kurtz developed
BASIC on in 1963.</p>

Kemeny and Kurtz had initially wanted GE to enter into a research
arrangement, but GE declined their proposal, and the original
partnership was structed purely as a commercial sale. However, as DTSS
grew successful GE became impressed with the flexibility of the
architecture and decided to take a more active role in its development.
Explicitly combining the GE-235 and DN-30 as the GE-265, GE started
advertising timesharing services on their own systems in 1965 and
building out a national network to allow access over dedicated lines.
<p>
At the same time GE had developed a new 36-bit mainframe architecture
supporting up to four CPUs and as much as 4MW of memory as a way to
reduce their own dependence on IBM. The GE 600 series started with the
GE-635 in 1963 (the above picture is a GE-645, a larger version with
hardware support for Multics and virtual memory) which ran GE’s GECOS
“GE Comprehensive Operating Supervisor” batch processing system. By 1967
DTSS had been ported to the GE-635/DN-30 and GE adopted it as their
“Mark II” network, retroactively dubbing their original GE-265
implementation as “Mark I.” By 1968 GE controlled somewhere between a
third and forty percent of the timesharing market, serving tens of
thousands of users, and the timesharing unit became its own division in
1969.
<p>
In 1970 GE decided to exit the computing hardware business and offloaded
the GE 600 series to Honeywell, who renamed it the Honeywell 6000
family. The Honeywell 6000s still used the same basic architecture and
still ran GECOS, merely renaming it to GCOS (“<em>General</em>
Comprehensive Operating <em>System</em>”), and GE started using their
hardware instead. However, GE retained their profitable timesharing
service, now transitioning to Honeywell hardware, developing a means for
Mark II systems to submit batch jobs to GCOS in a seamless and nearly
interactive fashion. This became the Mark III network in 1972.
<p>
<p>GE’s dominance of commercial timesharing grew even stronger in the
1970s with its high availability, facilitated by specialized clustering
hardware allowing users to be spread over up to six mainframes and have
the same view of the Mark II machines’ filesystem, and three redundant
international data centers equally accessible from anywhere in the
world. GE also evolved their remote access operations into a
packet-switched, telephone-accessible extended X.25 international
network that was included with their services. In 1979 GE spun off their
services division into the joint venture GEISCO (GE Information Services
Company) with Honeywell but bought back Honeywell’s portion in 1982,
later renaming it to General Electric Information Services (GEIS). By
the mid-1980s the Mark III network had local access numbers in over 750
cities and 31 countries, handling as many as five thousand simultaneous
users. GE eventually added other network types such as IBM SNA and by
the 1990s had four worldwide networks running on the same backbone.</p>

In 1984 the original Macintosh was a hit for Apple but came with new
costs of its own as the expense of maintaining its traditional dealer
network was skyrocketing. Interminable games of “telephone tag” had
already been a problem during the Apple II days and Apple was spending
half a million dollars a year — in 1984 dollars — just to print price
lists. Apple management reasoned that while setting up an electronic
dealer network would itself be pricey, it would enable them to contain
many of their distribution expenses, facilitate better communication,
and allow them to outsource their existing timesharing system used for
staff E-mail. Head of support John Ebbs, formerly a senior executive at
General Electric, suggested his former company could help develop a
useful service that could also show off the Mac at the same time.
<p>
<p>Apple approached GEISCO in 1984, making a key requirement to use the
Macintosh’s graphical interface instead of the text-based terminal
access GEISCO currently afforded users. For this GE engineers developed
a GCOS backend called EF3 (“Error-Free”) which the Macintosh client
would act as an asynchronous interface for, and Apple contracted with
Central Coast Software to write the front end, who developed it in
Pascal. To encourage dealer adoption Apple subsidized the network
somewhat by giving them a free hour of connect time per month and $15 an
hour (in 2024 about $43) thereafter, though this rate was higher outside
the United States. Unlike
<a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">services
such as The Source</a>, Apple’s service didn’t run on leftover
after-hours capacity and dealers were unlikely to connect when their
shops were closed, so the rate didn’t vary on the time of day. The first
release and availability of the new AppleLink network was in fall
1985.</p>

The AppleLink client version on this Macintosh Portable is 5.1. The
original AppleLink 1.0 client for the first generation Macintosh was
quickly upgraded for the Macintosh Plus in 1986 and I have one of these
floppies with “Macintosh Plus Version” prominently stamped on it.
Versions through at least 6.1 are known, with additional work done on
the client by Bear River Associates, then in Berkeley and
<a href="https://www.bearriver.com/about/">still in business</a> in
Oakland. Later versions of the client upgrade to GE’s later EFX
“Error-Free eXtended” protocol which replaced EF3.
<p>
<p>We know our Apple district manager used this because their
credentials are in the dialogue box (which I’ve suppressed). I haven’t
suppressed the rest, though, because they’re germane to understanding
how the Mark III network operated. And where we can learn the most about
it is from a much more famous online service that used it too:
GEnie.</p>

Separate from its work on AppleLink and related products we’ll discuss
at the end, GEIS had noted the rise of nascent consumer-oriented online
services like
<a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">The
Source</a> (then owned by Reader’s Digest in partnership with Control
Data Corporation) and CompuServe (a subsidiary of H&amp;R Block), and
decided they could compete in the same market — but with less overhead
and presumably more profitably, because they already had their own
nationwide local access network, their own hardware and their own data
centres. The job was tasked to
<a href="http://www.billlouden.com/bio.html">Bill Louden</a>,
CompuServe’s former director of communications and one of history’s
candidates for coining the term “email,” who transplanted facsimiles of
CompuServe’s most popular features to the new platform along with new
content while carefully concealing its GCOS underpinnings. Reportedly
the name “GEnie” came from Louden’s wife after a $50,000 consultant
disastrously proposed calling it “Albert” (Einstein), to which they
added the backronym “General Electric Network for Information Exchange.”
<p>
<p>The new GEnie service launched in October 1985 with both 300bps and
1200bps access. Criticially, although GEnie did have on-peak and
off-peak rates at a startling differential (launching at $35/hr
prime-time 8am-6pm on weekdays but $5/hr otherwise, or in 2024 dollars
about $100/hr and $14/hr respectively), GEnie undercut CompuServe by not
charging a premium for 1200 baud connections, offsetting any additional
cost from higher speed users against its excess unused computing time.
Eventually 2400bps access was added as well, also at the same “flat”
rates.</p>

A typical user would dial their local access number (8N1, local
echo-half duplex preferred) and after successful connection send a
series of <tt>H</tt> characters to get the network gateway’s attention
(contemporary sources said <tt>HHH</tt> and press RETURN, but really any
sequence of at least two would be enough). The local gateway would then
open an X.25 link to one of GE’s datacentres, which responded with a
famously terse login prompt. The initial dance looked a little like this

Signons to the Mark III network were of the general form
<tt>XXX#####</tt>, <tt>X</tt> being a letter and <tt>#</tt> a number.
The signons for creating a GEnie account (credit card required) often
literally started with <tt>X</tt>, such as <tt>XJM11878</tt> or
<tt>XTX99437</tt> — these were real signons that were in use at various
times. It was then followed by a comma and the password, which was
frequently <tt>GENIE</tt> or some such for the signup logins. If the
login was accepted, they would proceed to the main menu, which in 1986
looked like this (from the manual):

<p>
The menus provided a guided way to access GEnie services, but under the
hood everything was organized into numerical pages using the ubiquitous
<tt>MOVE</tt> (<tt>M</tt> for short) command. The main “top” menu was
always on page 1. While less-opaque word mnemonics also existed for many
services (printed at the top centre, so the top menu’s mnemonic was
<tt>TOP</tt>), if you knew the number for a particular area or
application, you could jump straight to it. Many users used GEnie
exclusively for games such as Kesmai’s Air Warrior and Simutronics’
GemStone, which offered massively multiplayer experiences decades before
modern MMOs, and had scripts in their terminal programs or clients to
check messages and then start their favourite game immediately. (Like
GEnie’s competitors, popular services like these often had surcharges,
which could sometimes be sizeable.) GemStone III, for example, was 1335,
E-mail was on 200, and the LiveWire “CB Simulator” chat system was on
400.
<P>
<p>In fact, the login sequence itself could even facilitate doing so
immediately upon signon, saving valuable connect time. If you logged in
as, say, <tt>XTX12345,password,625;1</tt> — remember this format, it
will be relevant later — which followed the login and password with
another comma, the page number, a semicolon, and an item number, this
would immediately move to page 625 (this was the Commodore 8-bit
“Flagship” RoundTable, GEnie jargon for a bulletin board) and select
option 1 from its menu (in this case showing you a list of categories).
The Commodore 8-bit community was especially concentrated on GEnie
during its final years after the shutdown of QuantumLink in 1993,
featuring <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/index.php">a large
filebase</a> and roundtable roster, and login scripts like
<a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/geniefiles/C128Telecom/GENIE-II">this
one for DesTerm 128</a> relied precisely on this capability (warning:
PETSCII). On the Apple side, a separate GEnie roundtable for Macintosh
users existed outside of AppleLink on page 605. Fortunately for
user-to-user communication services like these, most of the system used
friendlier alias names for accounts and generally relegated the network
login to authentication and billing.</p>

</div>
With GEnie’s operation as context, we should be able to see all the
pieces in the setup dialogue necessary to start reverse-engineering the
AppleLink signon process. The phone number has no area code, but
362-XXXX is one of the prefixes for nearby San Jose in Apple’s home area
code 408 (and since this user was dialing without an area code at the
time, this system must have been local to the gateway). Although GEIS
never published a comprehensive printed list of its access numbers that
I could find, it’s most likely that the machine on the other end was an
Apple-provided gateway with a leased line into the GE network (though
for the record Apple’s telephone exchange in Cupertino generally looks
like 408-996-XXXX). This Portable is fitted with an Apple internal
1200bps modem which was what this system was originally configured to
call out through. However, you can also route the call via (using the
Portable CDEV) the modem port or (this screen) the printer port to an
external modem or other serial link.
<p>
As for the signon, we can see a Mark III login of the standard format in
this window, here called the “System number.” Knowing what we know about
GEnie, that means the signon to access (at least this instance of)
AppleLink was <tt>NJL37300</tt> and the password was <tt>Apple</tt>
(note the comma between them), but this clearly couldn’t be an
individual user’s identifier. The AppleLink ID <em>is</em> populated
(I’ve only censored it), so it must transmit it somehow.
<p>
The way we find out is by looking at AppleLink’s CCL scripts. CCL stands
for Communications Control Language, a simple domain-specific scripting
language that originated with the AppleLink client as a means of adding
and adjusting connection methods without having to constantly update the
main application. They work essentially by emitting strings, or, for
control flow, branching on a matched string to a specified numeric
label, along with a small set of register variables and special keywords
to manipulate the serial port. CCL outlasted its original purpose: an
updated form became the modem scripting language for Apple Remote
Access, was updated again for Mac OS X through 10.4 Tiger to remove its
dependency on string resources, and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/HardwareDrivers/Reference/CCLScriptingRef/CCLCommands/CCLCommands.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005464-CH4-SW1">was
updated a final time in 10.5 Leopard</a> to support strings in property
lists. While most people no longer use modems and Macs haven’t included
them in years, the infrastructure remains supported in modern macOS for
things like external USB modems and serial ports, and you can still find
your Mac’s available CCLs in <tt>/Library/Modem Scripts</tt>.
<p>
It will be easiest for us to spoof AppleLink by pretending to be a
regular Hayes-compatible modem, and AppleLink has a CCL for that called
<tt>USAModem.CCL</tt>. Happily, these scripts are regular MacRoman and
readable with a text editor. Here are some extracts.

<p>The string “Signalling the modem” emitted by the keyword

</div>
This segment then goes on to set the strings it intends to respond to.
The <tt>MatchStr</tt> keyword takes three arguments, a string slot (only
a fixed number of strings can be searched for at once), a label to
branch to if the string is matched, and then the string itself. Matching
occurs automatically as text is received and matches do not (indeed
usually don’t) need to match the entire received string. It next sends
an AT command <tt>ATS0=0E0X4V1</tt> followed by a carriage return, which
sets modem register 0 to 0 (never auto-answer), turns off echo, turns on
busy signal and dial tone detection, and requests verbose English
responses. If the pause of 180 tenths of a second expires without a
matching string being received, it increments a variable and tries
again, branching after three tries to label 47 which aborts with a
timeout error. We’ll assume the modem replied with <tt>OK</tt>, which
will move us to label 2.

The dial string is then constructed from the Hayes <tt>ATD</tt> command,
whether tone or pulse dialing in the built-in variable <tt>TONE</tt>,
and then the phone number. If it successfully gets any unambiguous part
of the string <tt>CONNECT</tt>, it will assume success and move on to
label 4. Strings like <tt>BUSY</tt> and <tt>CARRIER</tt> (as in <tt>NO
CARRIER</tt>) branch to their own handlers. If the connection doesn’t go
through and isn’t otherwise handled, the <tt>JSR 20</tt> calls a
subroutine at label 20 which tries to hang up and reset the modem before
dialing again.

Having apparently connected, we now set up a match to respond to the
GCOS login prompt and send two H characters to get network attention. If

<em>Now</em> we see the structure of the logon string it’s sending: the
AppleLink ID and its password (separately prompted for) are appended as
a parameters, apparently twice and followed by several other keywords
and variables, though we don’t know the exact content of all these
variables yet. We can also see all the possible messages GCOS could send
back, most of which are errors, like (<tt>SER</tt>)<tt>VICE
INTERRUPTED</tt> or (<tt>SY</tt>)<tt>SYEM UNAVAIL</tt>(<tt>ABLE</tt>).
Only one of these, what looks like <tt>SYSTEM REA</tt>(<tt>DY</tt>),
actually leads to a success state, and that’s label 36:
<p>
<div class="tx">

This starts the client’s EFX handler and then exits back into the
application with return code 0, indicating success. The failure labels
all return with -1.
<p>
Now that we know what the connection script is looking for, we can type
the responses it’s expecting back to it. To avoid any potential
conflicts with the internal modem, I’ll configure AppleLink to
communicate via the printer port to a null modem connected with my
Raptor Talos II. (Impressively, this client version supports up to
19.2kbps, which would have been quite something in 1991. Those speeds
may have been intended for direct serial connections.) You’ll note the
script is explicitly terminating everything it sends with a carriage
return, so for display purposes we’ll have <tt>picocom</tt> translate
those to line feeds. Again, <b>bold</b> is what I typed back.

<p>I’m not sure why the exact same user string is sent twice except with

<p>Indeed, all of the preceding screenshots were generated with that

unfortunately I don’t know anything about EFX, so we can’t currently

… and then this final message before the client gives up completely,
which I suspect our intrepid astronauts on Space Shuttle Atlantis also
got a few times, though for a completely different reason.
<p>
<p>Let’s finish the AppleLink story before we close. By the end of 1985
AppleLink was a roaring success, at least in user terms, handling over
4,000 calls a day. This demonstrated to GE the concept could have some
utility to other corporations besides Apple, and in December 1985 GE
decided to use the same technology as AppleLink in their own product,
Businesstalk. Businesstalk was envisioned for any company with a large
dealer network, not just computer companies, many of which would have
been battling the same problems and expenses. The client was also
Mac-specific and built with the same codebase, at least initially, but
GEISCO’s charges were heftier at $35/hr prime time and $18/hr off,
presumably with the assumption that (like Apple) interested companies
would partially subsidize the rate. To GE’s dismay few seemed
interested, so in February 1986 GE relaunched Businesstalk as
Dealertalk, using the same Mac client but instead at an introductory
price of $9900 that included a site license, 15 days of training and 100
hours of free connect time. The price was intended to stoke interest
since GE threatened it would rise to $20,000 after July 31. It was

<!-- IW 12/86-->
In December 1986 GE tried once more under the BusinessTalk name again
(but note the camel case), unveiling a PC client alongside the Mac
version and marketing the service more as a corporate private bulletin
board. It was still $20,000 and the rate crept up to $36/hour, but there
was no limit on the number of clients that could connect. Possibly it
was the unlimited number of machines or maybe eliminating the
requirement to buy Macintoshes, but either way the third time was
finally a charm. By 1989 (the screenshot is from Infoworld showing the
MS-DOS version of BusinessTalk 5.0; compare similarities with the
AppleLink shot) users could communicate with other corporate E-mail
systems like Wang Office, DEC All-in-1 and IBM DISOSS and could even
send messages by fax. While it was still $20,000 to start, GE had enough
business that the connect rates were a more modest $23/hr prime and
$15/hr off by then, and Business Talk became used by diverse companies
such as financial company Charles Schwab to form SchwabLink. Despite
being notionally separate universes, Business Talk instances and
AppleLink nevertheless all ran on the same platform, and messages could
be sent and received between each other as well. (These later software
clients likely used a form of EFX also, so it may be possible to figure
out how it worked from them, but probably even fewer examples of those
still survive.)
<p>
Meanwhile, although allegedly saving them more than they spent, Apple
was chafing under the substantial amount of money they paid GE to keep
AppleLink operational. As more dealers and developers joined the system,
the more expensive it got (<i>Apple Confidential</i> cited a ballpark
fee of $30 million annually), and GE was unwilling to renegotiate. It
even got bad enough that Apple later sold CD-ROMs with AppleLink content
on them as a cheaper “offline” version to dampen interest.
<p>
<p>In 1987 Apple approached Steve Case, then running Quantum Computer
Services and the very successful QuantumLink online service for the
Commodore 64, to develop a cheaper alternative to which AppleLink
content could eventually be transferred. AppleLink Personal Edition ran
atop Quantum’s Stratus-based platform via Telenet and débuted first on
the Apple II in May 1988, but Apple and Quantum squabbled over the
future direction of the service and users complained about missing
features that the “real” AppleLink had. (In addition, some of GE’s code
and protocols were allegedly used without permission, further souring
the relationship.) Apple eventually paid off Quantum to get out of the
contract and the Mac version as such was never released. Instead,
Quantum used that money to finish the Mac client without the Apple
branding but using the same underlying infrastructure, and in 1991 that
client became part of Quantum’s new America Online.</p>

<p>Although Apple had managed to cut AppleLink costs somewhat in the
meantime, continued high expenditures eventually caused the company to
open a new request for proposals, and in 1992 they went back to Quantum
again which was now also called America Online. In return for Apple
paying AOL royalties, Apple would receive a stake in the company and
layer an AppleLink replacement on top of AOL’s infrastructure that would
additionally be offered to consumers. Due to Apple corporate turmoil the
new online service, christened eWorld, didn’t launch until June 1994 and
ended up directly competing with other new and established ones like AOL
itself, Delphi, CompuServe, Prodigy and, yes, GEnie. Apple had priced
its hourly rates high to temper demand, but that ended up working too
well, and they failed to even include it consistently with new Macs they
sold. Apple eventually forced the issue by moving employees from
AppleLink to eWorld to beef up traffic and, after Gil Amelio cancelled
eWorld in March 1996, started migrating to Web-based intranet
alternatives rather than move people back. AppleLink was finally shut
down on March 31, 1997.</p>

<p>As it happens, a similar process happened with GEIS. In April 1992 GE
announced plans for BusinessTalk 2000, a repackaging of the service
adding a Windows client to its Mac and DOS support, X.400 and X.500
message exchange, more online databases for access, and single seats
starting as low as $279 (the site license increased to $30,000). By
then, however, the growing Internet had started to erode customer
interest in proprietary network products, especially GEIS’ core
Electronic Data Interchange services. GEnie, though still successful,
suffered from a lack of expansion because it was only ever intended to
use up excess computing capacity and GEIS’ weakening revenue couldn’t
justify additional hardware. GEIS sold it off in 1996 as other clients
started moving away from GE’s proprietary services to Web-based
alternatives (the screenshot above of the historical GEIS website comes
from <a href="https://www.ammannato.it/geis-alumni/">this
remembrance</a>). Both GEnie (under new owners Yovelle and later telecom
IDT) and the Mark III network eventually succumbed to Y2K, as the GCOS
version in use didn’t handle it and it would have been too costly to
move them to new platforms, and both shut down in December 1999. The
majority of GEIS was reorganized as GXS (GE Global Exchange Services) in
2000, spun off in 2002, and subsequently bought out by OpenText in
2014.</p>
