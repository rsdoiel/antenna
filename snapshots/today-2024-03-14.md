It is not possible to independently verify the Russian claims. Cross-border attacks in the area have occurred sporadically since the war began and have been the subject of claims and counterclaims, as well as disinformation and propaganda.

<p>After posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKrt1E5fxLg">my deep-dive into the Pi 5's new BCM2712 and RP1 silicon</a> this morning, someone linked me to this GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876">Raspberry Pi 5 cannot overclock beyond 3.0GHz due to firmware limit(?)</a>.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, a few blog readers (most notably, tkaiser—thanks!) commented on PLLs, OPP tables, and DVFS and how something seemed a little off with the 3.0 GHz CPU limit—which was apparently recommended by Broadcom, according to that GitHub issue.</p>

<p>But today, <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1876#issuecomment-1997785709">@popcornmix generated a test firmware revision <em>without</em> the 3.0 GHz limit</a>, and zealous overclockers can get to pushing the clocks higher.</p></div>

## Biden’s Climate Agenda Is Actually Popular

date: 2024-03-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA5OTU3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNDk5ODM5M30.8JuthdR-tIFmA2N9NGM7tHzduLnU3ierm2_lQI0cbUY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">As President Joe Biden prepares to run for re-election, one fact has eluded much notice: His climate change policies are pretty popular. </p><p>In an exclusive Heatmap poll of 1,000 Americans conducted by Benenson Strategy Group late last year, most respondents backed the core ideas behind Biden’s climate policies. They expressed the most support of ideas meant to beef up the country’s manufacturing economy and build more renewable electricity.</p><p>Nearly 90% of Americans, for instance, support encouraging domestic manufacturing. They also support using tax incentives to make homes more energy efficient (85%), funding research into carbon dioxide removal (81%), investing in public transit (80%), and implementing policies that address environmental injustices (78%).</p><p>That is despite the overwhelming public disappointment in Biden. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has fallen to 37%</a>, an all-time low of his presidency, despite his boisterous State of the Union performance. At first glance, Biden’s climate policy might seem to pose a paradox: It’s really popular (at least facially), but nobody has seemed to notice. That may persist through the November election. But it will not be able to last for too long after that. </p><p>The least popular policies are those that Biden has pursued only when he has bipartisan support — or that he has not pursued at all. Making it easier to build new fossil fuel pipelines, for instance, is supported by 62% of Americans, less than almost any other policy aimed at increasing the country’s energy supply. A slight majority of Americans support making it easier to build new nuclear power plants. </p><h3>The public generally supports climate policy</h3><p>At first I doubted the veracity of these results — some of Biden’s policies are, after all, putting up autocrat-like ratings. A carbon tax is polling 52 points above water. </p><p>But these results largely match other polling. Surveys reliably find that about two-thirds of Americans would support some kind of carbon tax. Last year, for instance, 68%of Americans backed “requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax,” according to <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Yale poll</a>. These numbers have been remarkably stable over time. As much as 67% of Americans backed a carbon tax in 2019, according to <a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/voter-support-for-carbon-tax-may-depend-on-how-revenue-is-used/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a poll</a> from the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center on Public Affairs Research.</p><p>If these numbers surprise you, you’re not alone. Most Americans <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/06/most-americans-underestimate-the-popularity-of-policies-to-protect-the-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underestimate</a> public support for pro-climate policies. (Or at least, they underestimate what <em>polling</em> finds about Americans’ support for climate policies.) </p><p>The rub is that public support descends to more Earthly levels once you start asking about concrete costs. Those who say they support a carbon tax when told it will be imposed on fossil fuel companies, for instance, may change their minds after fossil fuel companies pass that tax along as higher prices. Another University of Chicago poll <a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/is-the-public-willing-to-pay-to-help-fix-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that most Americans were okay paying a monthly fee of $1 to fight climate change. When asked if they’d pay $40 a month, support fell to 23%. </p><h3>Climate policy is hard to pass</h3><p>One of the more ironic aspects of Biden’s success is how rapidly commentators have forgotten that climate change policy used to be seen as uniquely difficult to legislate in the United States. In 1993, and then again in 2010, the House of Representatives passed bills that would have helped fight climate change. Each time, the Senate blocked the legislation. The Senate also effectively blocked the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, the first international climate treaty, in the 1990s. </p><p>Through the decades, Congress passed energy bills meant to expand the energy supply in an all-of-the-above way and changed the tax code to let people and companies save money by building solar or wind energy. But these policies expired every few years, and they failed to amount to a unified climate strategy. </p><p>Other countries with other forms of government — China, the United Kingdom, the European Union member states — didn’t have this problem. (Which doesn’t mean that they’ve been perfect on climate change.) America’s failure to pass climate policy became a singular indictment of its bicameral system.</p><p>Why was it so hard to pass climate policy? The short answer is that for years, climate advocates focused on one particular policy — <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-tax-2025" target="_self">carbon pricing</a> — as a cure-all solution to climate change. And while carbon pricing is backed up by economic theory, environmentalists and economists struggled to generate the kind of durable, veto-proof support that legislation needs to pass in today’s environment. </p><p>By design, carbon pricing raises the cost of energy — meaning that opponents can paint it as a measure meant to increase the cost of living. That didn’t work for voters in the persistently sluggish economy of the 2010s, and it split Democrats’ coalition — of college-educated liberals and lower-income workers — in half. (It also struggled to deal with the political mise en scene. Washington’s interest in climate policy has usually peaked during moments of <em>high </em>energy prices, but the past decade’s fracking boom kept a lid on oil and natural gas prices.)</p><p>But climate advocates also struggled for years against more political-economic obstacles. As the political scientist Matto Mildenberger <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538251/carbon-captured/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented</a>, climate proposals have historically invited pro-business groups and labor unions to team up and fight a common enemy. Because climate policy targeted entire industries at once — and because these industries were, naturally, especially sensitive to wholesale energy prices — environmentalists had to take on labor <em>and</em> management at the same time. </p><p>It didn’t help that many of the industries concerned had a special claim to Democrats’ sensibilities. Until recently, many of the sectors most affected by climate policy were unionized at a higher rate than the average. Even today, more than 20% of utility workers belong to a union, for example, as compared to 6% of workers in the private sector. These rates were even higher in the recent past. About 16% of automaking workers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/20/uaw-contract-ford-general-motors-stellantis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are represented by unions</a> today, but union membership stood at 60% within living memory. Even in 2010, about one in 10 American workers in the mining, quarrying, and fossil-fuel extraction industries were represented by a union, which was also above the national rate at the time.</p><p>Democrats dealt with these problems by abandoning most broad-scale attempts to tax fossil fuels. During the Trump administration, progressives chose to focus instead on using industrial policy and regulations to rein in carbon-intensive sectors — instead of raising the cost of fossil fuels, perhaps a climate law could lower the cost of clean alternatives. And instead of raising energy prices — thereby annoying voters and discouraging high-profile industries — perhaps policy could lower them. Hence the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>This approach succeeded! And yet many of the IRA’s policies have struggled to attract public attention. Even though the IRA is Biden’s signature legislative achievement — comparable to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act — Biden has largely avoided the specific backlash that greeted that law. Obamacare was <a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&aRange=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about 10 points underwater</a> in 2010, even as Obama himself was about as popular as he was unpopular. Biden, by contrast, is incredibly disliked — <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he is now 17 points underwater</a>, a nadir for his presidency — yet the IRA’s core ideas remain well-liked. </p><p>That is politically inconvenient for Biden and it raises difficult long-term questions for progressives. Biden and Democrats have seemingly given voters what they want — and it’s not clear that the voters care.</p><h3>This is a long-term policy problem for Donald Trump</h3><p>But for the would-be Grover Cleveland to Biden's Benjamin Harrison, it might be <em>more </em>of a problem. If elected, Trump has promised to repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. His <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self">rhetoric on climate change</a> hasn’t really changed since the 2016 election, when he argued that it was “job-killing.” Meanwhile, he hates electric vehicles, claiming that “they don’t go far, they cost too much, and they’re all going to be made in China.” </p><p>Yet it’s the electric vehicles made in America that are going to get him. If Trump repeals the IRA’s subsidies, then domestic manufacturing will suffer. The EV industry <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ev-battery-manufacturing-energizes-southern-communities-battery-belt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has created</a> roughly 70,000 jobs over the past three years, and many of those roles are in electorally decisive states, including Georgia and Michigan. Trump has promised to act as a “Day One dictator,” but even then, he will still be at least partly constrained by the desires and interests of the local and state-level Republicans who support him — and <em>they </em>will need those jobs and investment to continue.</p><p>Of course, there’s no guarantee that these policies will produce political support. In Texas, an explosion of renewable construction has led not to surging public support for clean energy, but to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self">a state-led “war” on wind and solar</a>. (That said, renewables don’t generate local jobs and economic activity in the same long-term way that factories do.) Yet these policies don’t ever have to be <em>popular </em>to be <em>durable </em>— in part because voters won’t organize around them until they’re threatened. Biden’s climate policies — no matter how popular — will probably never win him reelection. But they could very well protect his legacy long after he’s gone.</p>

## Husband of American Journalist Jailed in Russia Brings Campaign to Washington

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The husband and two daughters of an American journalist jailed in Russia are in Washington this week to call on the U.S. government to do more to help secure the reporter’s release. 


Alsu Kurmasheva, a dual U.S.-Russian national, has been jailed in Russia since October 2023 on charges of failing to register as a so-called foreign agent and spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian army. 


Kurmasheva is a Prague-based editor at the Tatar-Bashkir service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL. The journalist and her employer reject the charges, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. 




Since Kurmasheva’s jailing, her husband, Pavel Butorin, has consistently called for her immediate release. He and their daughters traveled from Prague to Washington this week as part of the campaign to secure Kurmasheva’s release.  


“I’m here because I think that the U.S. government can and should do more for her release,” Butorin told VOA.  


Butorin is the director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language TV and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA.


While in Washington, Butorin met with State Department officials, but he did not specify to VOA what was discussed during those meetings.  


“We are making — I will say, cautiously — some progress toward the designation of Alsu as a wrongfully detained American journalist,” Butorin said. “I appreciate the support and attention that Alsu’s case has been given by the administration.” 


For months, Butorin, RFE/RL and international press freedom groups have called on the State Department to declare Kurmasheva wrongfully detained, which would open up additional resources to help secure her release.  


Russia’s embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a VOA email requesting comment.  


Kurmasheva is one of two American journalists jailed in Russia.  


The other — The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich — has been jailed in Russia since March 2023 on espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government deny. The 32-year-old is set to mark one year behind bars on March 29. 




The State Department has declared Gershkovich wrongfully detained. 


A State Department spokesperson said U.S. officials have pressed the Russian government for access to Kurmasheva, but those requests have not yet been granted.


“We are deeply concerned about Alsu Kurmasheva’s detention,” the spokesperson told VOA in a statement.  


“The Department of State continuously reviews the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those in Russia, for indicators that they are wrongful,” the spokesperson said regarding a potential wrongful detention determination. 


“I’ve been, again, assured that Alsu’s case is a priority. I’ve heard U.S. officials say that they do think that she is a political prisoner, and they’re working hard on her release,” Butorin said.  


Butorin added that the most just resolution would be for Moscow to drop the charges against his wife, who initially traveled to Russia in May 2023 for a family emergency. Her passports were confiscated when she tried to leave the country in June, and she was waiting for them to be returned when she was detained in October.  


“The charges are absurd — spurious. She’s not a criminal. We know her as a devoted mother to her daughters,” Butorin said. He added that the situation has taken a toll on their two children. 


“My daughters have had to grow up very quickly over these past nine months. It’s been an incredibly stressful situation for our family,” he said. “They want their mother back.”

## Prosecutors Say They're Open to Delay in Trump Hush Money Trial

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

new york — New York prosecutors said Thursday that they were open to delaying the start of Donald Trump's New York hush money criminal trial by up to a month to give the former president's lawyers time to review evidence that was only recently turned over. 


The Manhattan district attorney's office said in a court filing that it was not opposed to pushing the start of the trial back for up to 30 days. Jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin March 25. 


Trump's lawyers are seeking a 90-day delay or the dismissal of charges against Trump, alleging violations of what's known as the discovery process, where the sides exchange evidence. The new records came from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which previously investigated the hush money arrangement at the heart of Trump's New York criminal case. 


The defense has also sought to delay the trial until after the Supreme Court rules on Trump's presidential immunity claims, which his lawyers say could apply to some of the allegations and evidence in the hush money case. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments April 25. 


The judge in the hush money case, Juan Manuel Merchan, has yet to rule on either request. 


Since March 4, Trump's lawyers have received at least 84,000 pages of records from the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan, including a batch of 31,000 pages on Wednesday, according to a court filing. 


The records pertain to a federal investigation that touched on the hush money matter and led to prison time for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. 


Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Cohen with campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments, with evading taxes related to his investments in the taxi industry and with lying to Congress. 


Cohen, who blamed Trump for his legal problems, pleaded guilty and served about a year in prison before being released to home confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 


He is now a key prosecution witness in the Manhattan district attorney's case. Trump and his lawyers have portrayed Cohen as completely untrustworthy.

## Blinken to Visit Philippines to Reinforce Alliance Amid South China Sea Tensions

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

U.S. State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to the Philippines next week, following a recent trade mission there by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The visit comes amid escalating tensions between the Philippines and China over maritime disputes in the South China Sea. 


"Secretary Blinken will travel to Manila to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to our Philippine allies" and "promote peace and stability in the South China Sea," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a Thursday briefing. 


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has announced his meeting with Blinken on March 19, with a focus on issues of cooperation and security.


"The secretary's visit will also underscore the importance of our strong bilateral ties, which for 75 years, have been critical to advancing our shared vision for a free and open connected, prosperous, secure and resilient Indo-Pacific region," Miller said. 


During Commerce Secretary Raimondo's trade and investment mission to Manila this week, she announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in the Philippines' tech sector and help double the number of semiconductor factories in the country. Washington's move is seen as boosting Manila’s chip sector amid intense competition with Beijing. 




Blinken will start his trip late Thursday, heading first to Vienna for a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. His trip will include a stop in Seoul where South Korea is hosting a Summit for Democracy.


The meeting between Marcos and Blinken is set against a backdrop of increasing tension over territorial disputes in the South China Sea between Manila and Beijing. Marcos has committed to upholding the Philippines' maritime claims, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for military preparedness for potential sea conflicts.  


A recent collision near the waters around Second Thomas Shoal (known as Ren'ai Shoal in China) has further strained the relationship between the two countries. The rich fishing ground is about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the nearest Philippines island and 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) from China. 


On March 5, the Philippine Coast Guard said Chinese ships carried out dangerous maneuvers and fired water cannons on Philippine vessels, causing multiple collisions, and damaging at least one Philippine vessel.   


China accused the Philippines of intruding on its territory "without the permission of the Chinese government." A PRC spokesperson said the Chinese foreign ministry "has lodged solemn representations with the Philippines and expressed strong protest." 


According to an international tribunal’s legally binding decision issued in July 2016, Second Thomas Shoal is located within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, and China has no lawful maritime claims to the waters around the low-tide feature. 


Beijing has rejected the ruling, claiming "indisputable sovereignty" over most of the South China Sea. 


The United States said it stands with the Philippines. The State Department issued a strong statement on March 5 to condemn "the PRC’s repeated obstruction of Philippine vessels" and said Beijing’s actions "show disregard for the safety and livelihoods of Filipinos and international law." 


The White House has announced that it will host Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio for an official visit on April 10. Japanese media outlet The Asahi Shimbun reported that leaders from Japan, the United States and the Philippines are planning a summit in Washington around that time.

## Ex-Trump Aide Navarro, Convicted of Contempt of Congress, Must Report to Prison

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An appeals court denied Trump White House official Peter Navarro 's bid to stave off his jail sentence on contempt of Congress charges Thursday.


Navarro has been ordered to report to a federal prison by March 19. He argued he should stay free as he appeals his conviction for refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


But a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington disagreed, finding his appeal wasn't likely to reverse his conviction. His attorneys did not immediately return messages seeking comment but have previously indicated he would appeal to the Supreme Court.




Navarro was the second Trump aide convicted of contempt of Congress charges. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon previously received a four-month sentence, but a different judge allowed him to remain free pending appeal.


Navarro was found guilty of defying a subpoena for documents and a deposition from the House January 6 committee. He served as a White House trade adviser under then-President Donald Trump and later promoted the Republican's baseless claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.


Navarro has said he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he didn't show Trump had actually invoked it.

## Moscow Targets VOA Reporter in Latest Round of Sanctions Against Americans

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A Voice of America reporter was among more than 200 U.S. citizens sanctioned by the Russian government on Thursday.


The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Thursday that it was sanctioning Jeff Seldin, who covers national security at VOA. Seldin was among several reporters, including some from The Washington Post and The New York Times, to be included in this latest spate of sanctions against U.S. citizens.


In total, 227 American citizens were included in this round of sanctions over what the Russian government said was “anti-Russian activity.”


“Entry to the Russian Federation is closed to 227 Americans involved in the development, implementation and justification of the Russophobic course of the current U.S. administration,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on its website.


The announcement came just one day before the beginning of presidential elections in Russia that President Vladimir Putin is almost guaranteed to win.


Other journalists who were sanctioned included The Washington Post’s Joseph Marks, Joseph Menn, Ellen Nakashima and Tim Starks. Robert Worth from The New York Times was also on the list.


Seldin directed VOA to the outlet’s public relations team.


“VOA’s mandate is to provide accurate, objective, and comprehensive news and information to every part of the world,” the outlet said in a statement. “We stand by Jeff’s reporting and will not be deterred from serving our audience in Russia.”


Seldin isn’t the first VOA journalist to be sanctioned by Moscow. VOA’s former acting director, Yolanda Lopez, was sanctioned by the Russian government in May 2023.


Government officials, including U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, were included on the new list.


“We are deeply concerned by the Kremlin’s escalating attempts to restrict freedom of expression and media freedom in Russia,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA in a statement.


“In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin’s continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish independent journalists and civil society voices, including through the use of censorship laws to punish criticism of Russia’s brutal war,” the statement continued.


Moscow also sanctioned a slew of professors from various universities including Harvard, Yale and Columbia.


For Peter Clement, who teaches courses on Russian security policy at Columbia, being included in this round of sanctions didn’t come as a shock.


“I wasn’t surprised. It’s consistent with past Russian policy to issue what they view as reciprocal sanctions,” Clement told VOA.


The Kremlin has blocked more than 2,000 Americans from entering Russia in what it says is a response to U.S. sanctions against Russian individuals and companies.


The United States and other Western countries have hit Russia with a massive wave of sanctions in response to its war against Ukraine.


Some information in this report came from Agence France-Presse.

## Americans are opting to stay put

date: 2024-03-14, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Americans have long been known for pulling up stakes and moving for economic opportunity. But rather than chasing higher-paying jobs, more Americans are reluctant to move — and housing costs have something to do with it. Plus, there&#8217;s plenty of economic data on the table to discuss: Wholesale inflation came in warm but not hot, retail sales rebounded, and unemployment has stayed under 4% for 25 months now.</p>

## 24 Hours In a City Being Invaded By Rhinos

date: 2024-03-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc0MjEzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMzQwNjA4OH0.J5vOnAlg72ioDuRQdCjFAkP8KH5mSk9lPBobYcus2NQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Ganesh Paudel packs a wad of chewing tobacco as he talks about the rhinoceros attack. “When the rhino charged, we were in a boat,” he tells me. “The rhino was sitting in the water, then it hit me and broke my knee, broke the hand of another guide and gored a tourist” — he points — “through an eye.”</p><p>As we chat, another rhino wades in a stream just a short way away. Paudel works as a nature guide, but we’re not in nature today — we’re standing under a bridge that connects to a busy highway in Chitwan, a district of about a million people situated on the outskirts of Nepal’s <a href="https://chitwannationalpark.gov.np" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chitwan National Park</a>. A school bus passes and a few locals stop their scooters to whip out phones and film. But most keep moving without looking twice. </p><p>Rhinos <a href="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14870/images/cropped/Population_Distribution_GOH_Rhino.jpg?1513549364" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once roamed</a> from Pakistan to Bangladesh, but their numbers plummeted in the 20th century. Many cultures throughout Asia believe rhino horns have medicinal properties, making the creatures they’re attached to vulnerable to poaching. Rajas and royals prized rhinos as trophy kills. Farmers, also, retaliated with violence against rhinos that pillaged their crops. By 1970 there were just 95 rhinos in the national park, a wilderness bigger than New York City. </p><p>Eventually, however, the government realized that wildlife protection attracts dollars. For decades now, the United States Agency for International Development and non-governmental organizations like the World Wildlife Fund have supported Nepal’s efforts to boost conservation and lessen human wildlife conflict. Between 2011 and 2020 alone, $57 million of USAID funding went to programs aimed at protecting biodiversity here. Soldiers now patrol the park to stifle poaching. </p><p>But while the rhino population has rebounded to nearly 700 in Chitwan, the animals themselves are hardly thriving. As temperatures rise, there's been less rain during monsoon season. Warming temperatures have fueled invasive species like American creeper vines that have taken over rhino habitat and grow three inches daily. Climate change has also dried up staple rhino foods like elephant grass and aquatic plants. Now, there are too many rhinos and not enough forest, which forces the animals out of the park and into the city. (The same goes <a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tiger-problem.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for tigers</a>.) </p><p>The particular rhino wading near us is named Meghauli. Each morning, like clockwork, he comes <a href="https://twitter.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1748680578730275073/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out of the forest</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pubity/status/1685358264244912128/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into town</a>. Meghauli is a bona fide <a href="https://twitter.com/kiranjoshi235/status/1760135228822343795" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media star</a>. When he thuds down the road traffic stops and a parade of hypnotized Nepalis and foreigners <a href="https://twitter.com/277Roshan/status/1214400256533770241/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snap selfies</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KapilKoirala9/status/1556499499828527104/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touch</a> his leathery hide.</p><p>Meghauli was hand-raised by park staff after he was found alone, wounded from a tiger attack. Fed on 18 liters of buffalo milk a day, he grew big and strong — and also lost his fear of humans. Four years later he was released, but he kept returning because it’s easier to find food in town than in the increasingly dry and crowded jungle. </p><p>Rhinos are everywhere in the populated regions around the park — wading in streams, but also painted in murals, memorialized in hotel names, and depicted in statues. The uncomfortable truth is that the rhinos’ plight has also created a lucrative tourist opportunity. Rajendra Dhami, who runs a tea shop in front of Meghauli’s main crossing point, a shallow river with basking crocodiles and waiting tourists, tells me the rhinos have become a big attraction. “People come to see rhinos since we have them,” he says. “That means more money for us.”</p><p>A pair of young Brits and an Indian family of nine are currently gathered, waiting for Meghauli, but Dhami insists that for the most part, it doesn’t matter which rhino shows up. “We have lots of problems in Nepal,” he tells me, “but we share with wildlife.”</p><p>It’s true visitors often choose hotels and shops near wildlife. But a recent 20-year <a href="https://csc.apf.gov.np/admin-panel/docs/20190307145026.pdf#page=77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study found</a> that nature-based tourism rarely impacts locals, in part because hotel bookings are often made online with fancy tour operators who act as middlemen and skim off revenue much the same way food delivery sites take from restaurants. Meanwhile, just six of the 93 hotels here are owned or managed by indigenous people, according to the Regional Hotel Association Chitwan. For most Nepalis, especially in poor indigenous communities who rely on farming here, rhinos running around is bad for bottom lines — and bellies. </p><p>“Cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, rhinos like it all very much” says Narayan Rijal, who has worked as a park guide for 15 years. ”That’s the problem.”</p><p>But people, also, are hungry. Many here are in such need of food that they’re invading rhino habitat to find fruits, honey, and meat. Impoverished communities illegally enter the park to gather firewood, a cycle that increases deforestation, shrinks habitat, and risks deadly rhino, elephant, and <a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tiger-attack-in-chitwan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tiger attacks</a>.</p><p>Tulsi Magar, a guide at the local <a href="https://sanctuarynepal.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sanctuary</a> hotel, says many attacks are because farmers are so desperate to protect their own food that they stand their ground and light fires to try and scare off hungry rhinos. When Magar was 12, he also fought this way, sleeping in a shed and narrowly avoiding losing his life to protect the family’s radish harvest. </p><p>“It didn’t work,’ he remembers. “The rhinos won.”</p><p>Soldiers try their best to manage the rhinos, trailing them as they leave the park to forage in farmers’ fields. Once they reach town, soldiers often have to hit them with sticks or their rifle butts to get them to return to the forest. </p><p>“They‘re not small animals,” an assistant warden says as a rooster crows outside his office. “We try to push rhinos back into the core area. With Meghauli no need for stick, we just push. We do our best.”</p><p>Meghauli has a lookalike named Madi, another rescue. Unlike Meghauli, Madi is angry, park staff say, asking me to avoid using their names for fear of speaking openly. “Madi even charged a few taxis by the airport,” they admit. “He’s very aggressive.”</p><p>Rhinos have killed 55 people since 1998, including a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6905915/Australian-tourist-fights-life-mauled-rhino-safari-Nepal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 attack on safari-going tourists</a>. Last year alone, rhinos killed <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2023/02/21/man-dies-in-chitwan-rhino-attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five</a>. “They’re more dangerous than tigers,” notes Isswari Chapagain who has climbed trees to avoid charges. </p><p>Rhinos aren’t just a threat to locals, he says. They’re also a threat to each other. Wild rhinos go nuts and attack orphans like Meghauli and Madi if they smell people on them — another reason they keep coming back to town.</p><p>As the park has become famous and rhinos have rebounded, human activities like road expansion have been linked to a string of strange deaths: <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/23/latest-killing-of-two-rhinos-in-chitwan-sanctuary-alarms-conservationists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">165</a> rhinos killed from falling into roadside ditches and septic tanks, shocks from electric fences, disease (likely from proximity to livestock), and at least six killed by poachers. In 2022 alone, <a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/chitwan-national-park-rhino-deaths.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36 rhinos died</a> from territorial fights, which are also connected to warming temperatures and habitat loss. Construction on Chitwan’s three main rivers changes their flow, shrinks space, increases food competition and pushes rhinos into fields. </p><p>Rhinos are protected even if they attack or leave the park boundaries, but people aren’t. If they’re attacked in the park, Nepalis can claim government compensation (although guides cannot). If they’re at home protecting their farms and a rhino mauls them, they get nothing, another reason <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-12-rhino-nepal-burden-communities-infrastructure.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers accuse</a> the government of continuing to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14724049.2022.2139833" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prioritize wildlife</a> over people. </p><p>Back under the bridge, I watch Meghauli blow bubbles under the water, just like a kid. </p><p>When he rises, I see his massive body in full for the first time. He seems gentle but it wouldn’t take much — a jerk of his head or a kick from a leg — for him to kill someone. He exits the water and trudges up the riverbank, then pauses to scan the highway. He faces me and sniffs the air, then turns toward a potato field. It’s lunchtime.</p>

## Trump Arrives at Hearing on Whether to Dismiss Classified Documents Case

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

FORT PIERCE, FLORIDA — Donald Trump arrived Thursday at a federal courthouse in Florida, where a judge will hear arguments on whether to dismiss the criminal case accusing the former president of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House. 


The motorcade carrying the 2024 Republican presumptive presidential nominee arrived shortly before the hearing was set to begin before U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump. 


The dispute centers on the Trump team's interpretation of the Presidential Records Act, which they say gave him the authority to designate the documents as personal and maintain possession of them after his presidency. 


Special counsel Jack Smith's team, by contrast, says the files Trump is charged with possessing are presidential records, not personal ones, and that the statute does not apply to classified and top-secret documents such as those kept at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. 


The Presidential Records Act "does not exempt Trump from the criminal law, entitle him to unilaterally declare highly classified presidential records to be personal records, or shield him from criminal investigations — let alone allow him to obstruct a federal investigation with impunity," prosecutors wrote in a court filing last week. 


It was not clear when Cannon might rule, but the outcome will determine whether the case proceeds or whether, as Trump's lawyers hope, it is thrown out before ever reaching a jury — a rare action for a judge to take. 


Cannon is also expected to hear arguments Thursday on a separate but related Trump team motion that says the statute that forms the bulk of the criminal charges — making it a crime to willfully retain national defense information — is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to a former president. 


It is not surprising that defense lawyers are seeking dismissal of the case based on the Presidential Records Act given that the legal team has repeatedly invoked the statute since the FBI's August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. 


The law, enacted in 1978, requires presidents upon leaving office to transfer their presidential records to the U.S. government for management — specifically, the National Archives and Records Administration — although they are permitted to retain personal records, including diaries and notes that are purely private and not prepared for government business. 


Trump's lawyers have said that he designated as personal property the records he took with him to Mar-a-Lago, which prosecutors say included top-secret information and documents related to nuclear programs and the military capabilities of the U.S. and foreign adversaries. 


Cannon has suggested in the past that she sees Trump's status as a former president as distinguishing him from others who have held onto classified records. 


After the Trump team sued the Justice Department in 2022 to get his records back, Cannon appointed a special master to conduct an independent review of the documents taken during the FBI's Mar-a-Lago search. That appointment was later overturned by a federal appeals court. 


More recently, even while ruling in favor of Smith's team on a procedural question, Cannon pointedly described the case as the "first-ever criminal prosecution of a former United States President — once the country's chief classification authority over many of the documents the Special Counsel now seeks to withhold from him (and his cleared counsel) — in a case without charges of transmission or delivery of national defense information." 


Trump faces 40 felony counts in Florida that accuse him of willfully retaining dozens of classified documents and rebuffing government demands to give them back after he left the White House. Prosecutors in recent court filings have stressed the scope of criminal conduct that they say they expect to prove at trial, saying in one that "there has never been a case in American history in which a former official has engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump's." 


They allege, for instance, that Trump intentionally held onto some of the nation's most sensitive documents — only returning a fraction of them upon demand by the National Archives — and then urged his lawyer to hide records and to lie to the FBI by saying he no longer was in possession of them. He's also charged with enlisting staff to delete surveillance footage that would show boxes of documents being moved around the property. 


The hearing is the second this month in the case in Florida, one of four prosecutions Trump confronts as he seeks to reclaim the White House this year. Cannon heard arguments on March 1 on when to set a trial date but has not ruled yet. Both sides have proposed summertime dates for the trial to begin.

The largest newspaper chain in the United States has an ongoing business relationship with a company linked to a sprawling network of over a thousand &#8220;pink slime&#8221; publications — sites that profess to be local but have no local staff and do not disclose funding they’ve received from political sources.

## Observers: US Investments in Philippines Seen Easing Reliance on China

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — During a trade mission visit to Manila this week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in the Philippines’ tech sector and help double the number of semiconductor factories in the country.


Observers say the pledge and visit highlight the Southeast Asian nation’s growing importance to Washington and will also help reduce the Philippine economy’s reliance on China.


"U.S. companies have realized that our chip supply chain is way too concentrated in just a few countries in the world," Raimondo said in remarks at a business forum on Tuesday.


"Forget about geopolitics. Just at that level of concentration, you know the old adage, ‘Don't put all your eggs in one basket.’ Why do we allow ourselves to be buying so many of our chips from one or two countries? That's why we need to diversify," Raimondo said.


American business executives from 22 businesses, including Alphabet's Google, Visa and Microsoft, joined Raimondo on the trip.


Possible expansion of chip industry


JC Punongbayan, resident economist and columnist of the online news website Rappler.com, said that while the Philippines is one of the key centers in the global electronics industry chain, it does not yet have the ability to manufacture smartphone or computer chips. The Philippines currently has 13 semiconductor factories that focus on assembly, packaging and testing.


"This commitment by the U.S. government to boost the local semiconductor industry is a welcome development because right now, even if semiconductors have figured prominently in trade statistics, these are not high value-added. So basically, we import a lot of components and then export them after assembly and packaging,” Punongbayan told VOA’s Mandarin Service.


“Hopefully, these investments by the U.S. government and private sector partners will enable the Philippines to export higher value-added goods in the future," he said.


Punongbayan believes that at a time when the Philippines is working hard to amend its regulations and hoping to attract more foreign direct investment, the promised investment from U.S. companies could provide a strong boost to the capital-starved country.


"We have had some difficulties when it comes to attracting foreign investments. And in fact, from 2020 to 2023, foreign direct investments dropped by more than 6% on an annual basis. So, we really need these investments in order to boost the economy,” Punongbayan said.


“And the billion-dollar investment pledge of the U.S. is several times the actual foreign direct investments that have come in recent years — in fact, almost nine times the foreign direct investment from the U.S. in 2023. These are very crucial to Philippine development,” he said.


During Raimondo’s two-day visit, U.S. companies committed to invest in the digital and energy sectors, areas that are in line with Manila's overall development plans and will help the Philippines' industrial upgrading and transformation, Punongbayan said.


Defense and economy


Dindo Manhit, president of the Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and International Studies, a policy think tank in the Philippines, said that over the years, the Philippines' economic growth has been mainly driven by strong consumption.


These investment commitments by U.S. companies will accelerate local economic growth, Manhit said, benefiting both the public and private sectors and positively affecting areas such as the Philippines' manufacturing supply chain and business process outsourcing.


He said these investments could also allow Manila to fully understand that strengthening its alliance with Washington will not only bring it defense assistance but also economic security.


"Because we all share values, democratic values. We value jobs for people. In the case of the Philippines, imagine if we can create jobs that could provide better income for Filipinos,” Manhit said. “Then we will see the strong partnership with the U.S. not limited to national security only, but also economic security."




Washington’s pledges of economic support for the Philippines comes at a time of rising tensions between Manila and Beijing over sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.


Earlier this month, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo warned that Manila is facing severe "economic coercion" from China. He also said the Philippines relies heavily on trade relations with China and hopes to expand economic and trade connections with other countries, including establishing formal free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union as soon as possible.


Punongbayan said that despite the disputes in the South China Sea, Manila continues to import a large amount of goods from China, which is the largest source of the country's trade deficit. That shows how difficult it is for the country to decouple its economy from China, and why it is imperative for Manila to lessen its dependence on Beijing.


Greater interest from the United States to invest in the Philippines is a step in the right direction, he said.


"If we import a lot from China, then indirectly we are boosting China's economy at the same time. And of course, part of the revenues coming from these payments to China will go to the Chinese government,” Punongbayan said. “So indirectly, in a way, the Philippines is funding China's incursions in the West Philippine Sea.”


Manhit, however, said compared with other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippine economy is not very dependent on China.


According to recent poll by Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and International Studies, the country Filipinos most want to maintain good economic relations with is the U.S., followed by Japan, while China ranks at the bottom.


He said the poll not only shows that China does not have as strong an economic influence on the Philippines as Beijing claims, but also that Filipinos are unanimously willing to expand economic cooperation with countries that share common democratic values, or values of human rights and the rule of law.

## World's Largest Drone Maker Expands in US Amid Rights Abuse Allegations

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — Chinese drone maker DJI is expanding in the U.S. with its first flagship store in New York City amid allegations of links to human rights abuses and ties to China’s military.


DJI’s “first concept” North American store on New York’s Fifth Avenue welcomes customers into a futuristic, minimalist space to shop. The company describes itself on its website as “the world's leader in civil drones and creative camera technology.”


"We continue to see growing consumer demand throughout North America as we expand our consumer product portfolio," said Christina Zhang, senior director of corporate strategy at DJI.


Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, the company was founded in 2006. DJI, also known as Da Jiang Innovations, has become the world’s largest drone maker, having achieved global dominance in less than 20 years. The company now supplies 70% of the world's consumer drones and nearly 80% of U.S. consumer drones.


Abuse allegations


On March 5, the day of DJI’s official store opening in New York, the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), a Washington research and advocacy group, released a report titled Surveillance Tech Series: DJI’s Links to Human Rights Abuses in East Turkistan.


The report accuses DJI of being involved in mass surveillance and rights violations against Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other Muslim communities in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which the group calls East Turkistan.


“DJI is directly involved in mass surveillance schemes in East Turkistan and has supplied public security agencies with tools to surveil and target Uyghurs, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz people,” the UHRP report said. “Xinjiang public security departments entered into seven procurement orders with DJI that were worth nearly US$300,000 between 2019 and 2022.”


The report stated that DJI sells drones to Xinjiang’s paramilitary organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which the U.S. government sanctioned because of its “connection with serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities” in Xinjiang.


“Other documents show tenders worth US$47,000 for DJI drones for the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps,” the UHRP report stated.




The report also said that a DJI drone captured footage of dozens of individuals, seemingly Uyghur prisoners, blindfolded and shackled at a train station in southern Xinjiang. The video, first released on YouTube in 2019, garnered widespread media attention.


“It’s unethical to support a company that knowingly engages in egregious rights violations,” Nuzigum Setiwaldi, the report’s author, told Voice of America.


The U.S. and several Western parliaments have accused China of genocide in Xinjiang, targeting Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim populations. The U.N. human rights office released a report saying the human rights violations in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity. China criticized Western nations for spreading "lies" about human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet.


A spokesperson from DJI told VOA the company has not engaged in any activities, including sales distribution and product development, that violate or abuse human rights.


“Like other manufacturers, we do not have control over how our products are used as they are available off the shelf,” wrote a DJI spokesperson in an email response. “However, we have demonstrated – through years of investments in product safety and security initiatives – that our products are developed for peaceful and civilian use only.”


Chinese military company or not?


In 2022, The Washington Post reported that DJI obscured ties to Chinese government funding.


In the same year, the U.S. Department of Defense classified DJI as a "Chinese military company." As of January, DJI remains on the list of such companies operating in the United States. The department said it maintains companies on the list to counter China's Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which supports the modernization of the Chinese army.


Reuters reported that former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who ran the U.S. Justice Department from 2015 to 2017 and is now with the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison law firm, wrote a letter to the Defense Department last July on behalf of DJI, urging the removal of her client from the Pentagon's Chinese military companies list.


In her letter, Lynch cited the importance and urgency of such a move because of the wide use of and dependence on DJI products by a variety of U.S. stakeholders.


The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned in January that Chinese-made drones posed “significant risk” to U.S. national security and critical infrastructure.


“[T]he PRC’s 2017 National Intelligence Law compels Chinese companies to cooperate with state intelligence services, including providing access to data collected within China and around the world,” CISA said in its cybersecurity guidance on Chinese manufactured drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).


However, DJI’s spokesperson told VOA that DJI “is not a Chinese military company.”


According to DJI, the company remains one of the few drone companies that clearly “denounce and actively discourage” the use of drones in combat.


“We do not pursue business opportunities for combat use or operations. Our distributors, resellers and other business partners globally have also committed to following this policy when they sell and use our products,” DJI spokesperson said.

## The DOE Is Putting More Money into Clean Hydrogen

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. DOE announces $750 million for clean hydrogen R&D</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Department of Energy <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=17370a5152&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday a $750 million injection into 52 hydrogen research and development projects aimed at bringing down the price of <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=cd08a1ad28&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clean hydrogen</a> and making it a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Most of the money will go toward electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to split hydrogen from oxygen. Being able to produce more of these devices for less money – by improving the supply chains and automating manufacturing, for example – will help bring down the overall cost of clean hydrogen. The funding will also help support fuel cell production, as well as research into “recovery, recycling, and reuse of clean hydrogen materials and components.” This is the first distribution of the $1.5 billion that’s been carved out from the bipartisan infrastructure law for clean hydrogen. The Biden administration has also allotted $7 billion in federal funds to build <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9b86221b3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven hydrogen hubs</a> across the country, and these new R&D projects will “support the long-term viability” of these hubs, the DOE said.
</p><h3>2. Shell walks back some emissions pledges </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Oil giant Shell is watering down its commitment to scale back carbon emissions in the next few years. The company pledged in 2021 to reduce its “net carbon intensity” by 20% by 2030, but has adjusted that to between 15% and 20%, according to its latest energy transition strategy update. The goal of a 45% reduction by 2035 has been scrapped entirely. Net carbon intensity is a bit of a confusing term. Shell <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f7c55f8abb&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">defines</a> it as “emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell.” The <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ebbafc6441&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls it</a> “an accounting treatment that allows Shell to offset the carbon produced by its oil and gas business against its growing sales of lower-carbon products.”<br/>
<br/>
	“The change reflects Shell’s move away from supplying renewable power to homes,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e9552bb251&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Laura Hurst at <em>Bloomberg</em>. Shell also <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=72ec4eeaeb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> it aims to “reduce customer emissions” – or Scope 3 emissions – from its oil products by 15% to 20% by 2030. How? By “reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.” The company claims it can still get to net-zero emissions by 2050.
</p><h3>3. EU sues Greece over flood risk mismanagement</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The European Commission is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=55cc0d0114&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">suing Greece</a> for failing to manage flood risk. Under the European Green Deal, all EU member states are required to comply with water rules that help ensure, among other things, good management of river basins to help prepare for floods. The commission said that “Greece has so far not reviewed, adopted nor reported its river basin management plans,” and it is therefore referring the country to the EU’s high court. Greece isn’t the only country under pressure: The commission has also sued Bulgaria, Cyprus, Spain, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, and Slovakia for their own reporting failures. But the lawsuit against Greece comes five months after the country experienced historic floods in its Thessaly plain, “devastating crops and livestock and raising questions about the Mediterranean country's ability to deal with an increasingly erratic climate,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c702e8d053&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> <em>Reuters</em>.
</p><h3>4. Study: Methane leaks from U.S. oil and gas operations are vastly underestimated</h3><p>
<strong></strong>As the race to cut planet-warming methane emissions ramps up, new data is revealing the true scope of the problem. A new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8b85d2bee2&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">study</a> published yesterday in the journal <em>Nature</em> suggests fossil fuel operations in the U.S. may be emitting three times as much methane as previously thought. Energy production is the third largest source of methane emissions because the gas often leaks from oil wells and gas processing plants. But this new study – which examined 1 million measurements from aerial surveys over six major oil- and gas-producing regions in the U.S. – suggests we’ve been underestimating the size of these leaks, making projects like the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ca957c3f2d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MethaneSAT</a> even more important. Yesterday the International Energy Agency said methane emissions from the energy sector were still at record highs last year.
</p><h3>5. The U.K. has more giant redwoods than California</h3><p>Most people associate giant sequoias with the forests of California, but new research finds the trees are far more plentiful in Britain. The giant redwood was introduced to the UK in 1853 and has since thrived. There are an estimated 500,000 sequoias in the UK, compared with 80,000 in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, according to a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d9a5bc2c20&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> by Britain's academy of sciences, the Royal Society. While wildfire and drought threaten California’s redwoods, “in the UK our climate is more temperate, wetter, and so it is actually likely better suited to these trees in the long run,” said Dr Mathias Disney from University College London, one of the authors of the study.</p><p>To estimate the UK trees’ biomass, the researchers used laser scanning to measure the height of 97 trees from three locations. Here they are, ranked by size:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Where does TikTok go from here?

date: 2024-03-14, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>On Wednesday, the House of Representatives&#8217; passed a bill with bipartisan support that would force parent company ByteDance to either divest — to sell off — TikTok or see the app banned from U.S. app stores. But could such a divestiture happen? And would TikTok still be TikTok? Also on the program: The stock market is on a tear. Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor of The Economist, calls it &#8220;rational exuberance.&#8221;</p>

## Automakers Are Sharing Driver Data with Insurers without Consent

<blockquote><p>Modern cars are internet-enabled, allowing access to services like navigation, roadside assistance and car apps that drivers can connect to their vehicles to locate them or unlock them remotely. In recent years, automakers, including G.M., Honda, Kia and Hyundai, have started offering optional features in their connected-car apps that rate people&#8217;s driving. Some drivers may not realize that, if they turn on these features, the car companies then give information about how they drive to data brokers like LexisNexis [who then sell it to insurance companies]...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter

date: 2024-03-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-marking-the-web-s-35th-birthday-a-shorter-letter">2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter</h1>

<p>I think there are people with more interesting ideas than what Tim Berners-Lee has to say, given what I just read. <a href="https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42">His post</a> is on Medium so I had to read in eww, the browser built into Emacs. 😂 The most interesting fragment was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collectivise their solutions, and … overturn the online world being dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much out of context because it follows something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is a need, an urgent need, for others to do the same, to back the morally courageous leadership that is rising</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How weird is that? I started thinking. Where is that morally courageous leadership that is rising? Are they morally courageous but not in other ways? Is their morality courageous because their morals aren&rsquo;t recognized as morals or their morals might seem amoral to others? Or is amorality considered moral in the mainstream? Or isn&rsquo;t it rather that the mainstream knows full well what is moral but can&rsquo;t help the systemic pressures of having to earn money? Why isn&rsquo;t he advocating for system change? Is that what collectivisation is about? What exactly are we collectivising? The solutions? The products? The capital? Or is he just saying that the morally ambiguous but courageous leaders have ideas that we, collectively, ought to support? And the &ldquo;fundamental change&rdquo; he has in mind are &ldquo;Contract for the Web&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solid Protocol&rdquo;? I… I don&rsquo;t know… We must &ldquo;champion the efforts of those visionary individuals who are actively working to build a new, improved system&rdquo;? It just feels so weird. How about this alternative:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a web that is built for the people, by the people.</li>
<li>We need free ourselves from the shackles and fetters of corporations.</li>
<li>Remove corporations and their representatives from all governing bodies and committees.</li>
<li>All positions to be paid positions. Don&rsquo;t let those on the corporate payrolls take over.</li>
<li>One human, one vote. No strings attached. Don&rsquo;t tie votes to membership fees. This is for all of humanity.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me two minutes to write something that seemed a bit more visionary than what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind and if you like it, please don&rsquo;t champion me but talk to some friends and do a little thing, no matter how small, to support a few more people on the web. Run a forum, a wiki, provide email services, run a fediverse instance, run a HTML course at the library, collect money for a mutual aid fund, something, anything. The only conditions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it must be a concrete thing that you are actually doing</li>
<li>it must benefit more people than are involved in doing it</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to cap it. But it&rsquo;s important to start it. Just make it a point to enable somebody else. And just like that, we&rsquo;re taking back the web.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.piewpiew.se/@ohyran" title="@ohyran@social.piewpiew.se">@ohyran</a> commented on fedi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Its hardware all the way down&rdquo;. The internet created this fantasy of a secondary realm outside of the physical confines of our reality - that allowed us to think that the person who controlled the narrative in that alternative universe had some control. In fact the people in control of hardware, if that&rsquo;s servers or cables or switches, are in control. There is no second reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2024-03-14</strong>. Brian Kardell writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve argued that while the web ecosystem has become the infrastructure for nearly everything, our models for funding and prioritization of the last 20 years have proven not only inadequate, and problematic, but ultimately fragile and cannot last. The only questions, I’ve argued, are how soon and what happens next. Are we ready for it? (hint: no). – <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/HowWeFund.html">How We Fund the Web Ecosystem</a></p>

## China Says US TikTok Vote Follows 'Logic of a Bandit'

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — China on Thursday said the U.S. House of Representatives' approval of a bill that would force TikTok to sever ties with its Chinese parent company or be banned in the United States follows "entirely the logic of a bandit."


The short-video app has soared in popularity worldwide but its ownership by Chinese technology giant ByteDance — and alleged subservience to Beijing's ruling Communist Party — has fueled concern in Western capitals.


On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would force TikTok to divest from its parent company or face a nationwide ban.


The bill is yet to pass the Senate, where it is expected to face a tougher test to become law.




"The bill passed by the United States House of Representatives puts the United States on the opposite side of the principles of fair competition and international economic and trade rules," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular press conference.


"If so-called reasons of national security can be used to arbitrarily suppress excellent companies from other countries, then there is no fairness and justice at all," he said.


"When someone sees a good thing another person has and tries to take it for themself, this is entirely the logic of a bandit.


"The United States' handling of the TikTok incident will allow the world to see more clearly whether the United States' so-called rules and order are beneficial to the world, or whether they only serve the United States itself."

## Biden Keeps Israel Close, but Netanyahu Away

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — With increasingly frequent and vocal expressions of frustration, U.S. President Joe Biden appears to be distancing himself from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed that international pressure will not prevent Israel from achieving “total victory” in its war against Hamas.


The rift is fueling speculation that the U.S. might restrict the supply of American weapons, particularly if Netanyahu moves to “finish the job” against Hamas in Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltered.


Placing conditions on military aid would be Washington’s strongest leverage to affect Israel’s conduct of the war, which has killed more than 31,000 Palestinians according to Gaza’s health ministry.


While U.S. media have quoted anonymous administration sources saying they are considering that option, officially the White House has declined to “entertain hypotheticals.”


“The president has been very clear about our position on Rafah,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during Tuesday’s White House briefing. “A military operation in Rafah that does not protect civilians, that cuts off the main arteries of humanitarian assistance, and that places enormous pressure on the Israel-Egypt border, is not something that he can support.”


Biden himself was ambiguous about whether invading Rafah would cross a red line, saying he would never abandon Israel. At the same time, he rebuked the Netanyahu government for the way it has gone after Hamas following the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 240 hostage.




“The defense of Israel is still critical, so there's no red line [where] I'm going to cut off all weapons, so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them,” he said in a recent interview with MSNBC, even as he underscored that Israel “cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead.”


However, the president is telegraphing his rebukes. Caught on a hot mic while speaking to a Democratic senator last week, Biden said that he has told Netanyahu they are heading for a “come to Jesus” meeting, an expression for having a blunt conversation.


Told by an aide that he could be heard, Biden said, “Good. That’s good.”


Electoral goals


Biden’s increasingly public criticism of Netanyahu comes as he ramps up his campaign for reelection in November. The president faces competing constituencies within his Democratic base.


He cannot afford to give Republicans an opportunity to capture pro-Israel votes. But he also needs to stop progressive Democrats, young voters, Muslim and Arab Americans from abandoning him, as threatened by the significant portion of voters in some Democratic primaries who marked their ballots “uncommitted” to signal their outrage at the president’s support for Israel.


To address his domestic politics and foreign policy goals, Biden is “performing a political amputation of Bibi,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, using a nickname for Netanyahu.


The goal, Blumenfeld told VOA, is to separate what Biden considers Netanyahu’s “toxic war policies” from the state of Israel so that the president can follow his political instincts: to protect Israel from further attacks and facilitate the release of hostages “without sacrificing his moral core.”


Biden’s souring on Netanyahu may not be enough to appease pro-Palestinian Americans, particularly if a cease-fire isn’t secured soon. “Uncommitted” voters say they would abandon the president even when Biden surrogates point out that the Republican presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, known for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies, is likely to give Israel freer rein over its war conduct.




“I've lived through four years of Trump,” said Samraa Luqman, co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in Michigan. Palestinians, she told VOA, “cannot live through another Joe Biden presidency.”


Trump has avoided stating an explicit position on the war other than saying in a Fox News interview that Israel must “finish the problem” and that the “horrible invasion” by Hamas “would have never happened” if he were president.


Netanyahu hits back


In response to Biden’s criticism that Netanyahu is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel,” the prime minister hit back, saying in an interview with Politico that he has the support of the Israeli people.


If Biden meant “that I’m pursuing private policies against the majority, the wish of the majority of Israelis, and that this is hurting the interests of Israel, then he’s wrong on both counts,” Netanyahu said.


Only 15% of Israelis want Netanyahu to stay in office after the war ends, according to a poll by Israel Democracy Institute. But 56% believe that continuing the military offensive is the best way to recover the hostages.


In general, Israelis are focused on toppling Hamas, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University. To them, protecting civilians and providing humanitarian aid are “details,” he told VOA. “They don't understand the significance in America.”




Distrust in Netanyahu


Earlier this week, an annual threat assessment released by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) cited deepening "distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule" since the war broke. The prime minister’s “viability as leader” may be in jeopardy, the report said.


“It’s clear that the U.S. administration is going after Netanyahu,” said Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute.


As the process toward a political transition in Israel begins, Goren told VOA, the U.S. “is an actor in it.”


The ODNI report noted that “a different, more moderate government is a possibility,” drawing ire from Israeli officials who felt snubbed earlier this month when Israeli war Cabinet member Benny Gantz was received by Vice President Kamala Harris, Sullivan and Democratic congressional leaders.


Many see Gantz’s invitation to Washington as a sign of the administration’s support, should the popular centrist politician become Israel’s next prime minister.


Asked by VOA if Gantz’s visit is a signal that the administration is looking forward to an Israeli government without Netanyahu, national security communications adviser John Kirby flatly said, “No.”

## Biden Keeps Israel Close but Netanyahu Away

While U.S. President Joe Biden has continued to support Israel’s war against Hamas, he appears to be distancing himself from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The apparent rift between the leaders has fueled speculation that the U.S. might restrict military aid in a bid to influence Israel’s conduct in Gaza.

## March 13, 2024 

date: 2024-03-14, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

After yesterday&#8217;s primary contests, we appear headed toward a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024. But this year&#8217;s election is an entirely different kettle of fish than that of 2020. In 2020 there were plenty of red flags around Trump&#8217;s plans for a second term, but it was not until after it was clear he had lost the election that he gave up all pretense of normal presidential behavior. Beginning the night of the election, he tried to overturn that election and to install himself as president, ignoring the will of the voters, who had chosen Joe Biden. His attack on the fundamental principle of democracy ended the tradition of the peaceful transfer of power established in 1797 when our first president, George Washington, deliberately walked behind his successor, John Adams, after Adams was sworn into office.

## Biden to Raise Concern Over Nippon Steel's Deal for US Steel

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden plans to express concern over Nippon Steel's proposed $14.9 billion purchase of U.S. Steel, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, pushing the U.S. company's stock nearly 13% lower on bets the deal could face greater political opposition.


The issue has the potential to overshadow an April 10 summit between Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aimed at boosting the long-standing security alliance between their countries in the face of growing Chinese strength.


In December, Nippon Steel clinched a deal to buy the 122-year-old iconic U.S. steelmaker for a hefty premium, betting that U.S. Steel would benefit from the spending and tax incentives in Biden's infrastructure bill.


However, several Democratic and Republican U.S. senators have criticized the deal, citing national security concerns or raising questions about why the two companies did not consult U.S. Steel's main union ahead of the announcement.


Donald Trump, Biden's rival in the November U.S. presidential election, has said he would block the acquisition of U.S. Steel if elected. The White House said in December the deal needed to be carefully scrutinized given U.S. Steel's core role in producing a material that is critical to national security. 


The White House declined to comment on Wednesday, but a person familiar with the matter said Biden would issue a statement about the planned acquisition before Kishida arrives for his state visit.


U.S. officials and lawyers have drafted the statement, and the White House has privately informed the Japanese government of Biden's decision, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the news.


Japan's top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to comment on the report. "The Japan-U.S. alliance is stronger than ever, and the two countries will continue to work together ... in the field of economic security," Hayashi, chief cabinet secretary, told reporters on Thursday, echoing recent remarks by Japanese officials.


Matthew Goodman, a trade and economics expert at Washington's Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said the issue could overshadow the summit and be damaging for Kishida, who is already struggling politically at home.


"A prime minister of Japan has to demonstrate that he has the U.S. relationship not only under control, but that he's enhancing it," Goodman said. "So, to the extent this runs counter to that narrative politically at home, it's problematic."


Goodman said he thought the case of the acquisition being a risk to U.S. national security was "dubious" and questioning investments from a supposedly trusted security partner could be very damaging to the relationship.


"It's much more to do with politics in an election year when both nominees are appealing to support from steel workers and unions," he said of Biden and Trump.


In a joint statement, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said they welcomed the Biden administration's scrutiny of the transaction, as "an objective and comprehensive review of this transaction will demonstrate that it strengthens U.S. jobs, competition, and economic and national security."


Goodman said there have been long-standing concerns in the United States about Japanese labor practices and "non-support for unionization of workers in Japanese-owned factories in the U.S. well beyond steel."


The companies said they have had "active, dedicated discussions with the United Steelworkers, which are ongoing." 


 U.S. Steel, founded in 1901 by some of the biggest U.S. magnates, including Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and Charles Schwab, became intertwined with the industrial recovery following the Great Depression and World War II.


Last year, the Pittsburgh-based company launched a formal review of its strategic options after rebuffing a takeover offer from steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs.


Its shares had come under pressure following several quarters of falling revenue and profit, making it an attractive takeover target for rivals looking to add a maker of steel used by the automobile industry.


U.S. Steel shares closed 12.8% lower at $40.86 on Wednesday, well below Nippon's offer of $55 per share.

## ★ Apple Adjusts DMA Plan to Offer Direct Downloading of Apps From the Web (With a Big Asterisk), Custom Link-Out Screens, and Marketplaces Solely for the Distribution of a Developer’s Own Apps

## Biden Talks About Roads, Bridges, While Protesters Shout About Death in Gaza

date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA

Milwaukee, Wisconsin — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday visited Wisconsin, a key swing state that he narrowly won in 2020, meeting with community members at a once shuttered but now thriving children's community center to sell them on how he believes his economic policies are making their lives better.


Biden's approval ratings in the Badger State have recently slumped, and on Wednesday afternoon, as Biden chatted privately with campaign volunteers at his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee, less than a block away, several dozen protesters took aim at one reason why.


"Free, free, free Palestine!" the group members yelled as they waved Palestinian flags.


"Hey, Joe, what do you say, how many kids did you kill today," they also shouted.




Inside the White House's carefully managed events on Wednesday, the scene was different. Biden announced $3.3 billion in initiatives aimed at fixing transportation and infrastructure. He did not, during his public remarks, mention Gaza or any foreign policy issues.


"Everything we're doing is connecting people with opportunity, not disconnecting people from opportunity," Biden said, speaking at a community sports center that was shuttered during the pandemic but has since reopened.


"These projects will increase access to health care, schools, jobs, and will strengthen communities by covering highways with public spaces, creating new transit routes, adding sidewalks, bridges, bike lanes and more," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said to reporters aboard Air Force One.


The White House referred questions to the campaign when asked if Biden would meet with any Arab Americans in Wisconsin or Michigan, where he heads Thursday.


VOA asked Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, whether Biden had met — or would meet — with any concerned parties about the situation in Gaza.


"President Biden believes that every person's life is profoundly valuable," he replied. "From Palestine, Israel and around the world. He's working to move forward towards a just and peaceful enduring solution, as he said in the State of the Union address. And that is the thing that will make the biggest difference for the profound feelings that people have about this crisis."




The two main political contenders are taking a very different approach in this Midwestern state.


Biden said success in a closely contested state like Wisconsin "comes down to knocking on doors."




On Wednesday, he lingered inside his new Wisconsin campaign headquarters — in the largest city, Milwaukee — where he met with Democratic volunteers behind closed doors for more than an hour.


Meanwhile, supporters of Biden rival Donald Trump this week submitted petitions in Wisconsin to force a recall election against the state's top Republican, who refused calls to decertify Biden's legitimate, narrow win in 2020.


When asked if the Biden campaign had faith in the state's election process, Wikler was emphatic.


"Wisconsin has consistently been rated as among the best states in the country when it comes to administering elections," he said. "That system allows us to have elections up and down the ballot where voters can trust the outcome."

Mom would have been 111 today. She passed in &#8217;03 at 90, but that&#8217;s not what matters.

## LLVM Google Summer of Code 2024 & 2023

date: 2024-03-14, from: LLVM Blog

## 2024-03-13 What would happen if Google sunset Gmail?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-what-would-happen-if-google-sunset-gmail">2024-03-13 What would happen if Google sunset Gmail?</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes" title="@lrhodes@merveilles.town">@lrhodes</a> and <a class="account" href="https://jawns.club/@skyfaller" title="@skyfaller@jawns.club">@skyfaller</a> where discussing it on fedi and it got me thinking.
We all know how Google likes to end services.
Would it want to end Gmail?
Surely one day Gmail will end.
At that point, many people will no longer care.</p>

<p>So I wondered: who cares about email in general or Gmail in particular?</p>

<p>Looking around I sometimes get the feeling that most ordinary people use instant messengers these days. It&rsquo;s only corporations that want to reach people via email, mostly to send notifications about new info being available on their website (banks, insurances). But even in the corporate world, some notifications are moving to instant messenger apps (WhatsApp), or just proprietary apps (again, banks, insurances). Therefore I posit that in a few years, nobody (or &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; people) will <em>need</em> email.</p>

<p>For too many people, email just means <a href="2017-03-18_Email_is_the_New_Snail_Mail">getting bills and spam</a>.
Few people <em>love</em> email.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of the hair dresser who wants appointments via WhatsApp and the caterer for my wife&rsquo;s birthday party who wants to send me messages via WhatsApp. When not at work and still in a commercial setting, people use instant messengers. And my real life friends and family almost never send me email. It is always Threema or Signal.</p>

<p>And conversely, of course, in the corporate context all email I&rsquo;ve ever seen is Microsoft Outlook and that&rsquo;s getting emoji reactions and what not, so they are going to turn into a corporate proprietary messaging service (maybe not instant…). What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that I think the value of Gmail keeps dropping. It&rsquo;s a glorified &ldquo;forgot my password&rdquo; service.</p>

<p>Perhaps my problem is that don&rsquo;t see much email communication from customers to business (C2B). The bigger corporations I know use contact forms (again, banks, insurances, retail). The smaller corporations use websites like Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Booking.com or whatnot to communicate with customers.</p>

<p>The value of email is dropping.</p>

<p>And it makes sense: it can be self-hosted, it can be easy to set up, it&rsquo;s totally federated – of course the big corporations are only interested in extracting all its value. They don&rsquo;t mind leaving behind a hollow husk. They don&rsquo;t mind making it hard to reach their customers inside the Gmail and Outlook silos. As long as the people inside the golden silo feel fine, that&rsquo;s not going to change.</p>

<p>I still think, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>For B2B communication, Outlook wins.</li>
<li>For C2B communication, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, Instagram, TripAdvisor, Booking.com and the like win</li>
<li>For human interaction, WhatsApp, Messenger, Threema and Signal win</li>
</ul>

<p>One day, Google will decide that there&rsquo;s no value left for them in email and they&rsquo;ll drop Gmail just like <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">they dropped all the other things</a>.</p>

<p>I happen to really like email, though. I mean… I like the really simple email. I hate email servers like Exim and Postfix and all their weird configuration files and DoveCot and SSL and SASL. Strangely enough, starting up a minimal web server takes me a few minutes to search for the right Python command or shell command, no config necessary, just listen on port 443 and off you go. Where is that all-in-one solution that works for a dozen people? A small club? I don&rsquo;t need a server optimized to serve a whole university campus.</p>

<p>I like reading and writing email on the command line. I guess that within a small circle friends – like that news server I&rsquo;m running that has some newsgroups that aren&rsquo;t connected to Usenet – like the Tilde servers! – that should work. We can rebuild the kind of Internet we like. Sure, it won&rsquo;t reach millions, but I&rsquo;ll be happy if it reaches the right two dozen people.</p>

## How to opt in to (or out of) the audio version

date: 2024-03-13, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Hi Folks, What follows is a sparklingly clear set of instructions for opting in to the audio version of Letters from an American (and yes, I&#8217;m being flippant. It always seems to me the tech stuff is easy&#8230; but only once you figure it out.) It turns out that you cannot use the Substack app to adjust your settings so that you can receive the audio version of the letters automatically. The instructions I sent around before should have made clear that you have to use the browser version of Substack to make ANY changes to your settings.

## What Does Amazon Want With Nuclear?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTcyNzgyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMzUyNTc5NH0.LbQ1HhX-jkoCOEa3j9LdYwCgXBWI-NR1nvslHnTl4Sg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When Talen Energy, which owns a 90% interest in the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Northeastern Pennsylvania, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-talen-cumulus-data-ai" target="_blank">announced</a> it was selling a data center site adjacent to its power plant to Amazon Web Services, it raised some eyebrows in the energy world. The surprise was not because a large tech company made a big deal with a carbon-free power provider, or even that a tech company made a deal to buy power generated by a nuclear power plant. It was because <em>Amazon</em> was making <em>this</em> deal. </p><p>Amazon is a massive buyer of renewable power — it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-renewable-energy-portfolio-january-2024-update#:~:text=With%20more%20than%20500%20solar,fourth%20year%20in%20a%20row." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims to be</a> the world’s largest and says it’s responsible for 28 gigawatts of clean energy capacity — signing contracts with new wind and solar projects all over the world. </p><p>But a divide has opened up among tech giants when it comes to energy, with Amazon on one side and Alphabet and Microsoft on the other. The difference hinges on how much it matters <em>where and when </em>the new carbon-free power a company buys in order to match its electricity use. </p><p>What’s odd about the Talen deal is that it fits awkwardly into either approach, especially Amazon’s. Amazon does not count nuclear towards its renewable power goals, and in any case, it’s not a “new” source of carbon-free power. Instead, it allows Amazon to siphon somewhere between 480 and 960 megawatts of capacity from the 2,500 megawatt plant.</p><p>“Amazon <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_self">needs power</a>, they’re getting it at cheap rates. They don’t even want to talk about it like a climate thing,” Mark Nelson, the founder of Radiant Energy Group, told me.</p><p>In the past decade or so, technology companies have gone on a clean-power buying spree, funding new wind and solar projects all over the world. But there has been a divergence in what is thought to be the best way to go about it.</p><p>In 2019, Amazon announced a goal to <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/4/amazon-extends-position-as-the-worlds-largest-corporate-buyer-of-renewable-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">add enough renewable power</a> to the grid to match its own emissions by 2030 (since moved up to 2025) and to reach net zero by 2040. </p><p>Google has been 100% renewable in terms of buying clean power in the same amounts that it consumes <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since 2017.</a> So in 2020, it <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set a new goal</a>: to “run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030.” This would mean not just matching total renewable purchases with total emissions, as Amazon is seeking to do, but also trying to get every hour of data center operation “matched” with an hour of renewable generation on the same grid. </p><p>Microsoft has a similar goal, and as a result, both companies have shown much more interest in nuclear power of late than is typical in the technology world. </p><p>“A huge bottleneck for growth for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook is access to constant electricity,” Nelson told me. Nuclear is a carbon-free electricity resource that can run at a steady output 24 hours a day, whereas wind and solar are both inherently variable.</p><p>Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation to supply power to data centers in Virginia and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f073b54d-9290-49b4-8ee7-56b4fb3d8177" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hired an official</a> from the Tennessee Valley Authority to be its director of nuclear and energy innovations, while Microsoft founder <a href="https://www.terrapower.com/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a> and<a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/articles/announcing-500-million-fundraise/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Sam Altman</a>, the head of Microsoft-backed OpenAI have both invested in nuclear startups, as has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/google-chevron-invest-in-fusion-startup-tae-technologies.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a>.</p><p>Amazon’s approach — which it <a href="https://www.emissionsfirst.com/principles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shares</a> with several other large companies, <a href="https://www.emissionsfirst.com/principles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including Meta</a> — is not to match 24 hours of its operations with clean power bought locally, but rather to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/corporate-clean-energy-procurement-carbon-matching-meta-google-amazon-tabors-report/652011/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">develop and purchase</a> new wind and solar at the same scale of the power it consumes, <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/carbon-methodology.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially in areas with dirty grids</a>, thus matching the emissions from its consumption with the emissions reductions of new renewables projects. While a 24/7 matching approach may be naturally complementary with nuclear power, Amazon’s strategy doesn’t require it. </p><p>“We believe a focus on emissions is the fastest, most cost-effective and scalable way to leverage corporate clean energy procurement to help decarbonize global power grids at the fastest pace,” an Amazon spokesperson told me. “This includes procuring renewable energy in locations and countries that still rely heavily on fossil fuels to power their grids, and where energy projects can have the biggest impact on carbon reduction.” </p><p>Contracting out new renewable energy projects can have more bang for your buck in dirty grids, according to proponents of the Amazon philosophy, known as carbon matching. The hypothesis is that a renewable project in a fossil fuel-heavy grid will displace more dirty power than one that’s located near a datacenter in an <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/princetons-zero-lab-has-it-wrong-on-corporate-renewable-energy-procurement/696956/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already relatively clean grid like California or Washington State</a>. </p><p><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-meta-clean-energy-procurement-zero-lab-24-7-carbon-matching/693108/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Princeton researchers</a> who examined the carbon matching (Amazon) and temporal matching (Google and Microsoft) strategies argued that the carbon matching approach does not necessarily lead to more renewables — or less fossil fuels — on the grid than would have occurred in the absence of the tech companies, and thus does not actually greatly lower emissions. The temporal approach, on the other hand, can meaningfully displace fossil fuel power that would otherwise have to be on the grid to meet demand. </p><p>Nuclear advocates are clear-eyed that this deal won’t cause a new generating unit to sprout up out of the Susquehanna Valley. But they still see it as the kind of deal that can help ensure nuclear plants’ continued survival. Amazon’s $650 million buys it a 10-year agreement to purchase power from the plant, as well as “additional revenue from AWS related to sales of carbon-free energy to the grid,” which an Amazon spokesperson explained as a reference to the deal “ensur[ing] that the nuclear plant has stable revenues to continue generating clean power to the grid for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>Nelson, a passionate advocate for nuclear power, lamented the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46820/3#:~:text=Twelve%20U.S.%20nuclear%20power%20reactors,%25%20of%20U.S.%20nuclear%20capacity)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mass shutdown of nuclear power plants</a> in the 2010s thanks to cheap natural gas knocking them out of power markets that didn’t value reliability or carbon-free energy. But now, he says, things are different.</p><p>“Now nuclear is getting valued for its climate properties, reliability, and low cost. We’re seeing nuclear plants cash in,” Nelson told me. “Long term PPAs with cold hard cash help me sleep better at night.”</p>

## World’s cleanest lake is getting a new flying electric hydrofoil ferry

date: 2024-03-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/13/corectblogroil.png">This image</a> was the result of a late night collaboration with ChatGPT. For some reason it can't spell anything right, and when I asked it to correct the spelling it mocked me. But I loved the design. It understood the hard part of what I was asking for. </p>
<p>The Knicks have been slumping since two of their top players have been out with injuries for over a month, after having an amazing January. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby">One</a> of the two star players came back last night, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39718456/og-anunoby-lifts-knicks-blowout-win-76ers-return">what a difference</a>! They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span> </p>

## 2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h1>

<p>The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined audience. It
is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It&rsquo;s more than writing into a
booklet, &ldquo;Dear Diary, …&rdquo; – and yet we do it even if there are no comments.
Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think I&rsquo;m just as happy getting the
occasional email or reply on the fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the
words is terrifying. And once I got that first comment, once I started linking
the blog from my profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to read and
implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was something I feared.
The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart beats. The heart bleeds.</p>

<p>Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments. First, there&rsquo;s a
comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk a look? But then the
imagined audience is still there and now it&rsquo;s worse. How will I react as I am being watched?
Blogging turns into a performance where I feel like I&rsquo;m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am I? All
the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really
don&rsquo;t want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren&rsquo;t very observant being unable to perceive their
own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.</p>

<p>The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously. Words
are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to weight them
carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
long or how short the page, how trivial or how controversial the topic.</p>

<p>And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts unexamined
and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the judgements. How often have
I found myself falling short of my own measure.</p>

<p>To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for me, for
my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I struggle for virtue
and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined reader and myself. As proof.
&ldquo;I struggled!&rdquo; I struggle. I keep on struggling to discover what is right and
to do what is right.</p>

<p>Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things that I
think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my mind. I write
about the things I know because I did not know them before. And who cares about
those laborious system administration blog posts where I struggle with this or
that ephemeral problem. All these issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People
find their answers on Stack Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized
platform where middlemen gamify the experience so that we can help each other
while on the thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I do,
when I&rsquo;m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And there are so
many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved articles and snippets are
more like compost heaps, where layer upon layer of good stuff gets dropped,
never to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a fire,
somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that is fine. The
world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one thought knows not the
next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion of the sleepless mind. Our
books, our journals, our blogs, our posts, they all participate. Perhaps we
fall for those waves of outrage and the galaxy brain has a seizure as we all
throw our weight around in unison, crushing innocent lives, leaving those we
hurt behind, forgetting them as quickly as we forget about the outrage.</p>

<p>Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one sparking a
fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and posts on social
media has certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and blogging.
And this is why I cannot stop blogging.
To blog in that half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and
perhaps they are not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks
onto that great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of us can
talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to blog.</p>

<p>I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to think
long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing. I keep
failing and so I must keep blogging.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a></p>

<p>p1k3 wrote back in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about meetings. The mind reflecting on its own function. … Writing about writing might not have quite the same potential for nested, generative dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. – <a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my posts.
The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on that, too, by the same author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one.  The ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost entirely unsupportable to me now.  And yet:  Nothing else has quite the same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of.  The one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away.
Not worth the electrons it was written with! But who&rsquo;s doing the judging: you, or that imagined audience I was talking about?</p>

<p>I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening audience.
And really, who is going to read my blog?
Internet stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my parents. (Hi mom!)
I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I&rsquo;m feeling anxious.
Because writing in a paper notebook I don&rsquo;t feel judged.
Surely there&rsquo;s a similar place, online.
The key is to find that happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging nightmare might be.</p>

<p>For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right. Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit.
All these sites are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden, Zettelkasten, there&rsquo;s not enough difference to draw lines.
It&rsquo;s all a question of intent, of culture, of belonging.
The blog spirit is to write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive.
The digital garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined or not.
The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to more thoughts on new notes.
And the wiki spirit is to write and edit online, to hit the Save button and then it&rsquo;s live.
There is no editor, there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management.
I can see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old web power.
It&rsquo;s not an app. The software has no idea of process.
The wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save.
And then I read it again, and edit it.
And tomorrow, I read it again, and edit it.
And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.</p>

<p>I no longer live in the <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do disappear into the great compost of thoughts.
The archive gobbles them up. I do go back but I don&rsquo;t rewrite the pages completely.
I&rsquo;m more likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this page.</p>

<p>I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don&rsquo;t like at all.
I do leave some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad opinions held.</p>

<p>What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren&rsquo;t gems.
They are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not job applications.
And if I don&rsquo;t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise it.
Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret something, or I add something.
I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I add new pages.
What I don&rsquo;t do is polish the old posts.
There will be more great posts in the future.
The important part is the writing.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading <a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where meaning is discussed.</p>

<p>Meaning without an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is … generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking, or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better about life, or change those feelings somehow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then with an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got an email from <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> with a link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>This is how it starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds something to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two “views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.</p>

<p>A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page lists all the pages in the order of their creation.</p>

<p>A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a> page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).</p>

And none of the big journalists even asked the question -- where is this asshole coming from. Our journalists, today, who protest that we need them to keep our democracy, and then they assassinate it. When are we ever going to stand up and put a stop to this. BTW, Substack where she hosts her incredible writing, makes it impossible to find a web link to a story you recieve via email. It's very easy to get to the article in their app. I prefer the open web, and always will. I don't want Substack's app.

## Intel continues prepping the Linux kernel for X86S

date: 2024-03-13, from: OS News

Nearly one year ago Intel published the X86S specification (formerly stylized as &#8220;X86-S&#8221;) for simplifying the Intel architecture by removing support for 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems. X86S is a big step forward with dropping legacy mode, 5-level paging improvements, and other modernization improvements for x86_64. With the Linux 6.9 kernel more x86S bits are in place for this ongoing effort. ↫ Michael Larabel I doubt we&#8217;ll see much fallout from these changes.

## Judge in Georgia Election Case Dismisses Some Trump Charges

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA, GEORGIA — The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case on Wednesday dismissed some of the charges against former President Donald Trump, but many other counts in the indictment remain. 


Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote in an order that six of the counts in the indictment must be quashed, including three against Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. 


But the order leaves intact other charges, and the judge wrote that prosecutors could seek a new indictment on the charges he dismissed. 


The six charges are about soliciting elected officials to violate their oaths of office. That includes two charges related to the phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, on January 2, 2021. 


"All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have," Trump said. 


The case accuses Trump and 18 others of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty. 


The ruling comes as McAfee is also considering a bid by defendants to have Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case. Defendants have alleged that Willis has a conflict of interest because of her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

## Judge dismisses some charges against Trump in the Georgia 2020 election interference case

date: 2024-03-13, from: San Jose Mercury News

The judge overseeing the Georgia 2020 election interference case has dismissed some of the charges against ex-President Donald Trump, but others remain. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote Wednesday in an order that six of the charges in the indictment must be quashed, including three against Trump. The order leaves intact many other charges in the indictment. The judge wrote that prosecutors could seek a new indictment on the charges he dismissed. The six charges in question have to do with soliciting elected officials to violate their oaths of office. One of the counts stems from a phone call Trump made to fellow Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021. Trump denies wrongdoing.

<h4>Microsoft prepares to replace an old faithful with something shiny, new, and lacking key features.

## When Will Methane Emissions Fall?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Storms dropped hail stones big enough to leave craters in the ground in Argentina • Denver is expecting more than a foot of snow • A wildfire outbreak is possible in Texas and Oklahoma.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. IEA: Methane emissions from energy still high but could fall soon</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Methane emissions from energy production around the world reached a record high in 2019, and have remained at that level ever since, with 2023 being no exception, according to the International Energy Agency’s <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d6a3b3b7e9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 Global Methane Tracker</a>. Methane is a greenhouse gas that traps more heat than carbon dioxide, and is responsible for about one-third of the total rise in global temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels. Fossil fuel production is not the only source of methane emissions, but it is a big one, and it is within our control. Improvements to oil and gas infrastructure can reduce methane leaks, for example.

</p><p>
	Last year oil, gas, and coal producers added more than 120 million metric tonnes of methane to the atmosphere, a number that is “unacceptably high,” said the IEA’s chief energy economist Tim Gould. The agency called for a 75% reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuels this decade to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and said new policies, pledges, and methane-tracking satellites could bring emissions down soon. “If all methane pledges made by countries and companies to date are implemented in full and on time, it would be sufficient to cut methane emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030,” the IEA said. “However, most pledges are not yet backed up by plans for implementation.”

<strong></strong>The Biden administration yesterday <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=08104050f9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> details of its plan to create the infrastructure needed to electrify the nation’s trucking fleet. “Heavy duty vehicles have a disproportionate effect on pollution, as large diesel engines release many more particulate emissions than light-duty vehicles do,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9d6edc9c6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Jameson Dow at <em>Electrek</em>. Indeed the transportation sector accounts for about 30% of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, and more than a fifth of that comes from the biggest trucks. Phase 1 of the plan is to build out charging and hydrogen fueling hubs along some 12,000 miles of roads between 2024 and 2027, targeting some of the busiest routes first, including those around major ports. After the hubs are established, the subsequent phases would then connect those hubs to one another, and then expand the network. Here is a look at the hubs:

The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FOA) hosts the annual gathering so the “main stakeholders of the global banana supply-chain work together to achieve consensus on best practices for sustainable production and trade.” This week the event took place in Rome, and climate change was top of the agenda. “Farmers are battling daily with unpredictable weather patterns, scorching sun, floods, hurricanes, and increased cases of plant diseases,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=989345743e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Anna Pierides, a sustainable sourcing manager at the Fairtrade Foundation. She warned that farmers may go out of business if they do not get more support and see fairer prices. “There will be some price increases, indeed,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=abb41aff4e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Pascal Liu, senior economist at the FAO. “If there’s not a major increase in supply, I project that banana prices will remain relatively high in the coming years.” Bananas are the world’s most exported fruit.

<strong></strong>For the second day in a row, police forcibly <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=128c7a3a2c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a> Greta Thunberg from the entrance to the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. The 21-year-old climate activist and other protesters began their demonstration there yesterday, protesting against what they see as inaction from political leaders in addressing the climate crisis. After Thunberg refused to move, police lifted her by the arms and put her about 20 meters away from the building’s door.

We’re not talking about “lab grown” meat here, but plant products made to taste like meat. Animal agriculture accounts for up to 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=de55773fc6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>, and meat consumption is expected to grow by 50% by 2050. Meat alternatives could reduce the environmental footprint of the food system, but only if they taste good enough to convert enough meat lovers. Last week Oscar Mayer <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e9643b903e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it had partnered with a Bezos-backed food startup to create meatless hot dogs and sausages that “not only deliver on great taste, but also bring the smell, appearance, texture, and grill marks consumers desire and want.”

They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

## Argentina’s inflation rate finally falls

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Argentina&#8217;s inflation — the world&#8217;s highest — has slowed down from 20.6% in January to 13.2% in February. Then, hundreds of U.K. post office managers were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software calculated that money was missing from their branches. Today, the government will introduce legislation to quash the convictions. And businesses in Chile are preparing to cut their employees&#8217; hours from 45 to 40 hours a week following a new law.</p>

## A Conversation With Biden’s Former Top Economic Advisor, Part 1

	Few people have shaped Bidenomics more than Brian Deese.
</p><p>
	From 2021 to 2023, Deese led the National Economic Council at the White House, serving as President Joe Biden’s top economic aide during such events as the post-pandemic recovery, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p><p>
	Before that, Deese was global head of sustainable investing for Blackrock and a senior political advisor to President Barack Obama. He’s now the Institute Innovation Fellow at MIT, where he helps lead the Clean Investment Monitor, a project that tracks investment in climate technology and infrastructure across the U.S. economy.
</p><p>
	On this episode, Deese joins Shift Key for a two-part conversation. Part 1 focuses on the future of Bidenomics, Biden’s State of the Union speech, what the 2024 campaign might mean for the politics and policy of climate change.

</iframe>
</p></center><p>Here is an excerpt from our conversation:</p><blockquote><strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I want to start by talking about the State of the Union. Jesse, I feel like you had a stronger response to the State of the Union than I did. Where I saw it and I was like, yes, the president is talking about the IRA, he's talking about big climate legislation, primarily in a jobs context. I feel like you were maybe more surprised.<br/><br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>What I was kind of expecting was Biden to lean in a bit more on the manufacturing Renaissance story. And he referenced it a couple times as sort of the high level numbers, which we can come back to, which probably came from your Clean Investment Monitor project, if I'm not mistaken. And he told the story of the Belvedere plant that was saved from bankruptcy through the UAW negotiations and is now being rebuilt as a EV manufacturing facility. But I was expecting him to say something more broadly about how we have been talking about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America for my entire lifetime, right, for decades.<br/>
<br/>
	And the previous president, of course, also made lots of promises about trying to support US manufacturing. And then of course, did basically nothing to do that. And Biden has an incredible track record on that front, an enormous amount of investment happening across multiple sectors, and in particular in the clean energy domain.<br/> And maybe this is just the limits of a State of the Union address where you got to touch a lot of different issues. But I kind of expected him to lean into that a little bit more and to make it clear that it wasn't just this one plant, that there are dozens of stories like Belvedere out there across the economy that are being fueled specifically by the Inflation Reduction Act, which by the way, he did never really mention by name.<br/>
<br/>
	So I was curious how you saw it and if you thought he had the right balance or maybe could have leaned in more or could do so in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brian Deese: </strong>Well, I think one of the things about State of the Unions is that its quality and moments are often more important than quantity. And so I think that may be a little bit of what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
	But let me step back. Look, I think it was an excellent speech and I think it was delivered in an even more excellent way. And at the top line, the speech was designed to drive pace and clear contrast.<br/>
<br/>
	It's interesting that some of the reaction has been partisan. But if you actually go through the speech, it's really clear-eyed contrast. And a lot of the things where the contrast exists are between, as the president said multiple times, his predecessor and the vast majority of the American people. And that's smart.<br/>
<br/>
	And the pace was evident from the get-go and positioned President Biden to do exactly what he wanted to do, was to get in the chamber at the podium and go at this thing and demonstrate his capability, but also his enthusiasm. I think for people who actually watched it on TV, you saw not only a president who was in command, but who was having a lot of fun. And a lot of fun because I think he believed in what he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
	So that's the most important. And when you're structuring a speech like this, you want to say, if that's your goal is to try to have clear contrast and pace, how do you keep that going? I think in some ways the most important line which goes, Jesse, to the point you are making is he said something to the effect of, it doesn't make the news, it doesn't make the headlines, but in thousands of cities across America, people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.<br/>
<br/>
	And I would anticipate that in that idea, in thousands of cities and towns across America, greatest comeback story never told will be a consistent refrain and a throughline to try to get at exactly your point, which is there's an element of that, which reflects a little bit of immediate criticism, right? The greatest comeback story never told, which is why do we never hear about these things going on again?<br/>
<br/>
	But it also reflects the kind of great American story that these comeback stories are in fact happening. And for the people and the communities themselves, it matters.<br/>
<br/>
	And look, I think that that's where Belvedere fit in, which is oftentimes the best way to try to bring to life that idea is not by trying to describe or animate all of the ways in which it's happening across the country and people like the three of us get very gripped by the overarching statistics.<br/>
<br/>
	But the story and the story of Belvedere was one that if you look across the speech, there aren't that many moments where you can actually tell a story like that. And so there was a clear decision to say, this is a story and we are going to tell the story about clean energy manufacturing through the lens of a place and a community, which is really about jobs and grit and resilience. And for those who weren't paying line by line attention to the story of Belvedere, is Belvedere, Illinois, home of a storied Chrysler plant that was initiated in 1965 I'll continue to refer to Stellantis as Chrysler because I still can't get over the idea that we're not still referring it to as that name, but was basically for a whole bunch of reasons an auto plant that was on its back and then was closed and for a variety of reasons, including the strength of UAW's negotiating posture, but also the prospect of bringing battery manufacturing here to the U.S., Belvedere has gone from, you know, is really a Phoenix rising story in a pretty concrete way.<br/>
<br/>
	So my takeaway from Jesse, your surprise, is that in fact, what the president did was provide a frame for going out and telling that great comeback story and going and telling it. And in fact, the way to tell it will actually be in individual stories in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, I think that makes sense. I guess what I was thinking was there'd be an opportunity to draw a sharper contrast, which would be pretty consistent with the rest of the speech between President Biden and his quote unquote predecessor. In the sense that really, I mean, we, we've been literally politicians have been promising to bring manufacturing back since the 70s and 80s, right.<br/>
<br/>
	And now we are seeing that investment really thanks to a whole suite of policies, some of them bipartisan, like CHIPS and Science, and some of them, you know, I think with broad support in the American public, like you're saying, Brian, even if the partisan nature of the congressional debate right now, you know, makes it seem more partisan than it is, it's, you know, these are broadly popular policies. So it was kind of expecting a little bit more contrast there.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## Berkeley to Return Parking Lot on Sacred Site to Ohlone Tribe

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco Bay Area parking lot that sits on top of a sacred tribal shell mound dating back 5,700 years has been returned to the Ohlone people by the Berkeley City Council after a settlement with developers who own the land.


Berkeley's City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to adopt an ordinance giving the title of the land to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, a women-led, San Francisco Bay Area collective that works to return land to Indigenous people and that raised the funds needed to reach the agreement. 


“This was a long, long effort but it was honestly worth it because what we’re doing today is righting past wrongs and returning stolen land to the people who once lived on it," said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin. 


The nearly 1-hectare parking lot is the only undeveloped portion of the West Berkeley shell mound, a three-block area Berkeley designated as a landmark in 2000. 


Before Spanish colonizers arrived in the region, that area held a village and a massive shell mound with a height of 6 meters and the length and width of a football field that was a ceremonial and burial site. Built over years with mussel, clam and oyster shells, human remains, and artifacts, the mound also served as a lookout. 




The Spanish removed the Ohlone from their villages and forced them into labor at local missions. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Anglo settlers took over the land and razed the shell mound to line roadbeds in Berkeley with shells.


“It's a very sad and shameful history,” said Berkeley City Councilmember Sophie Hahn, who spearheaded the effort to return the land to the Ohlone. 


“This was the site of a thriving village going back at least 5,700 years and there are still Ohlone people among us and their connection to this site is very, very deep and very real, and this is what we are honoring,” she added. 


The agreement with Berkeley-based Ruegg & Ellsworth LLC, which owns the parking lot, comes after a six-year legal fight that started in 2018 when the developer sued the city after officials denied its application to build a 260-unit apartment building with 50% affordable housing and along with retail and parking space. 


The settlement was reached after Ruegg & Ellsworth agreed to accept $27 million to settle all outstanding claims and to turn the property over to Berkeley. The Sogorea Te’ Land Trust contributed $25.5 million and Berkeley paid $1.5 million, officials said.

 

The trust plans to build a commemorative park with a new shell mound and a cultural center to house some of the pottery, jewelry, baskets and other artifacts found over the years and that are in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. 


Corrina Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, addressed council members before they voted, saying their vote was the culmination of the work of thousands of people over many years. 


The mound that once stood there was “a place where we first said goodbye to someone,” she said. “To have this place saved forever, I am beyond words.”


Gould, who is also tribal chair of the Confederated Villages of Lisjan Ohlone, attended the meeting via video conference and wiped away tears after Berkeley’s City Council voted to return the land.

## Classified Document Hearing Shows Stiff Partisan Divides on Biden's Responsibility, Memory

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Members of Congress on Tuesday turned a hearing about President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents into a charged referendum on a question central to the upcoming presidential election: the 81-year-old's mental fitness. 


The Biden administration and their main challengers, the backers of presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump, emerged from the House Judiciary Committee's five-hour grilling of Special Counsel Robert Hur with radically different answers to that question.


They also starkly disagreed over Hur's decision not to file criminal charges, despite concluding in his February report that Biden "willfully retained and disclosed classified materials as a private citizen."


Criminal charges were not warranted, Hur argued in announcing his decision in early February, because, he said, Biden would likely present himself to a jury as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory" — words that Republican legislators repeated, repeatedly, during the hearing. 


Afterward, Ian Sams, spokesperson for the White House counsel's office, gave his take:


"The main thing I took away from the hearing today was that we had three hours of the Republicans showing just how hypocritical they're willing to be in order to politically attack the president at the same time that they and the Democrats and the special counsel himself laid bare exactly why there is no case here," he said.


"The case is closed, the evidence did not support bringing charges, and it's over," Sams said. "It's time to move on."


Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesperson for Trump's Make America Great Again movement, offered his own conclusion.


"Joe Biden put America's national security at risk with his illegal retention and disclosure of classified material," he said. "Biden lied about his wrongdoing in a national press conference, which begs the question — what else is Joe Biden lying about?" 


Further muddying the picture on the matter is Hur's own grammatically complex statement: 


"The word exoneration does not appear anywhere in my report and that is not my conclusion," Hur said. 


A newly released transcript of Hur's five-hour interview held last year with Biden, includes instances of Biden saying he couldn't recall details or citing dates incorrectly, appearing to say in one instance that his eldest son died in 2017 and that Trump, who was elected in 2016, was "elected in November of 2017."


"The transcript is now available for every American to see, for all media to see," Sams said. He noted it shows that, despite the confusion over the year of Beau Biden's death, it shows that Biden correctly cited the date: May 30. 


"I think that you saw the anger and emotional reaction of a father who still experiences the pain of that loss every single day," Sams said. 


Many Republicans used their five-minute question periods to compare Biden's situation to that of his challenger. Trump, too, faces criminal charges over his handling of classified documents after he left office. He was initially slapped with 37 felony counts, including charges that he obstructed justice by failing to return the documents even in response to a subpoena. It's not clear when that case will go to trial. 


Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, in one sentence, took aim at the justice system and Biden's mental acuity: "This guy's not getting treated the same way as Trump, because the elevator is not going to the top floor, so we can't prove intent."


Democrats resisted that characterization. 


"Joe Biden is a competent, good president who knows American values," Tennessee Representative Steve Cohen said.


Hur, in his opening statement, said he would "refrain from speculating or commenting on areas outside the scope of the investigation."


But he also responded to criticism that he overstepped, saying he could not have reached the conclusion he did "without assessing the president's state of mind."


Other elected representatives chose not to ask Hur any questions, such as Missouri Representative Cori Bush, a Democrat, who described Hur's report as a "partisan hit job" — though she said it was appropriate for both Trump and Biden to be investigated. 


"Our country deserves better than this," she said of the hearing. 


Texas Representative Nathaniel Moran praised Hur's efforts, asking him only yes-or-no questions and suggesting Biden could be ruled incompetent by a District of Columbia court and placed under guardianship. And he repeated the critical line from Hur's report — words sure to echo over November's presidential contest — although he prefaced it with an adjective, calling Biden a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html">MacWrite and MacPaint</a> for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.

## Subject codes, incomplete and unreliable, have got to go

date: 2024-03-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Subject classifications have been available via the REST API for many years but have not been complete or reliable from the start and will soon be deprecated.</p>
<p>The <code>subject</code> metadata element was born out of a Labs experiment intended to enrich the metadata returned via Crossref Metadata Search with All Subject Journal Classification codes from Scopus. This feature was developed when the REST API was still fairly new, and we now recognize that the initial implementation worked its way into the service prematurely.</p>
<p>While subject classifications in Crossref metadata could be very useful, the current implementation in the REST API is problematic for three primary reasons:</p>
<p><strong>They are misleadingly exposed in the API as a property of the work,</strong> when in fact they are a property of the container (e.g. a journal or conference proceeding). Just because a journal’s broad topic category is “X” doesn’t mean that a particular article in the journal is about “X.”</p>
<p><strong>Existing works may have outdated subjects.</strong> Originally, subject codes were not updated periodically. However, subjects exposed in the /journals route are now updated once a day. Those exposed via the /works endpoint are indexed along with works, and so when a new subject list is ingested, new DOIs start getting new subjects, but existing works may have outdated subjects. We don’t have a mechanism for forcing updates when incorrect subject values are returned via the REST API, so this data can be stale and incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>They are not applied to everything.</strong> This is because the Scopus list does not cover all the journals that Crossref has (conversely, the Scopus list contains some journals Crossref does not have), and does not contain other container types.</p>
<p>The Labs team investigated options for improving subject classification coverage but ultimately concluded that there are insufficient solutions to the coverage problem. For more, please see Esha Datta’s findings published at Force11’s Upstream: <a href="https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48</a></p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Rather than continuing to supply unreliable and misleading subject category metadata, we will be deprecating this feature in the coming weeks. To minimize disruption and avoid breaking changes at this time, we will be removing this data from our index, so the subject element will simply be empty. We may remove the <code>subject</code> element in the future.</p>
<p>We know that the community’s desire for subject-based analysis of metadata is very strong, and we have supported efforts to establish a multidisciplinary taxonomy. Inaccurate codes in the meantime do not help but actually hinder these efforts, giving the false impression that they are correct.</p>
<p>We aim to deprecate the subject codes in April of this year.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns by leaving a comment below, which will start a thread in our community forum.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p>Q. Will the subject field continue to be available and functional?<br>
A. The subject metadata element will continue to be included in the JSON response but will not return any values.</p>
<p>Q. Will new subject codes be added in the future?<br>
A. We do not have any current plans to add new subject codes in the future.</p>
<p>Q. I received a notification about this, but we don’t use subject codes. Do I need to do anything?<br>
A. No, if you do not currently use the <code>subject</code> element, you do not need to do anything about this change.</p>
<p>Q. I noticed that wrong or inaccurate subject codes were assigned to my works. Is this a solution?<br>
A. Yes. Until we can identify an accurate and sustainable system for assigning subject codes to Crossref metadata records, we want to stop assigning inaccurate subject codes and remove all existing assignments.</p>

## GHC 9.10.1-alpha1 is now available

date: 2024-03-13, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.10.1-alpha1 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">bgamari - 2024-03-13</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the first alpha release of GHC 9.10.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.10 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The introduction of the <code>GHC2024</code> language edition, building upon
<code>GHC2021</code> with the addition of a number of widely-used extensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Partial implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>, allowing visible
quantification to be used in the types of terms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/624">Extension</a> of LinearTypes to allow linear <code>let</code> and <code>where</code>
bindings</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/330">exception backtrace proposal</a>, allowing the annotation of exceptions with backtraces, as well
as other user-defined context</p></li>
<li><p>Further improvements in the info table provenance mechanism, reducing
code size to allow IPE information to be enabled more widely</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript FFI support in the WebAssembly backend</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements in the fragmentation characteristics of the low-latency
non-moving garbage collector.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.10.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>Many will notice that this release comes a fair bit later than the
previously-announced schedule. While this delay has been attributable to a
variety factors, the most recent cause is a set of issues with GHC 9.10’s
binary distributions on Windows (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24542">#24542</a>). Instead of continuing to hold up the
release process while we sort out this situation, we have instead provided this
alpha without the usual assortment of Windows binary distributions. We expect
to have this resolved by alpha 2; apologies to eager Windows testers for this
delay.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a [ticket][] if you see
anything amiss.</p>
