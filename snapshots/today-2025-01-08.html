It looks like Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i dual-screen laptop is here to stay.
First introduced in 2023 with a pair of 13.3 inch OLED displays and an
Intel Raptor Lake processor, Lenovo launched an updated model with an
Intel Meteor Lake processor a year later. Now it’s time for round three

<h2 id="why-are-my-live-regions-not-working">Why are my live regions not
working?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, updated: 2025-01-08, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/">Why
are my live regions not working?</a></strong>
</p>
Useful article to help understand
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA
live regions</a>. Short version: you can add a live region to your page
like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="notification" aria-live="assertive"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Then any time you use JavaScript to modify the text content in that
element it will be announced straight away by any screen readers -
that’s the “assertive” part. Using “polite” instead will cause the
notification to be queued up for when the user is idle instead.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few catches. Most notably, the contents of an
<code>aria-live</code> region will usually NOT be spoken out loud when
the page first loads, or when that element is added to the DOM. You need
to ensure the element is available and <em>not hidden</em> before
updating it for the effect to work reliably across different screen
readers.

</p>
I couldn’t figure out how to upgrade the version of Python 3.13 I had
previous installed using <code>uv</code> - I had Python 3.13.0.rc2.
Thanks to Charlie Marsh I learned the command for upgrading to the
latest uv-supported release:
</p>
<pre><code>uv python install --reinstall 3.13
</code></pre>
<p>
I can confirm it worked using:
</p>
<pre><code>uv run --python 3.13 python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)'
</code></pre>

Caveat from Zanie Blue on

PR to document this</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are some caveats we’d need to document here, like this will break
existing tool installations (and other virtual environments) that depend
on the version. You’d be better off doing <code>uv python install
3.13.X</code> to add the new patch version in addition to the existing
one.

I followed this curiosity, to see if a tool that can generate something
mostly not wrong most of the time could be a net benefit in my daily
work. The answer appears to be yes, generative models are useful for me
when I program. It has not been easy to get to this point. My underlying
fascination with the new technology is the only way I have managed to
figure it out, so I am sympathetic when other engineers claim LLMs are
“useless.” But as I have been asked more than once how I can possibly
use them effectively, this post is my attempt to describe what I have

The Asus ROG Flow Z13 is a 2-in-1 tablet that’s made for gaming. Asus
has been selling versions of this 13.4 inch tablet for a few years.

Gaming laptops are usually big, heavy machines that sacrifice battery
life and portability for high-performance hardware. But over the past

that’s both powerful and portable. The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 has a
