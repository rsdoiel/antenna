A couple of years ago I begged Elie Mystal to make the abortion chapter of his wonderful book available publicly for free, because it explained the implications of Dobbs so incredibly well and uniquely. Turns they <em>did</em> make it public, I didn&#39;t know then so couldn&#39;t promote it. Oy!

Maureen Dowd basically wrote the same piece I just wrote. Trump’s great service may be that we’re finally freed from the control freaks who used to run the Dems. Now somehow we have to survive the insanity that it came with.

A couple of weeks ago I wouldn’t have written this piece for fear of having my life ruined. Now it makes sense to explain why so many men voted for Trump, imho mistakenly, because they were driven away by fear of men. To rebuild, we have to first go through our fear, because it’s the right thing to do, and finally we have no choice,

## Episode 145 - Zuse's Mysterious Machines

date: 2024-11-11, from: Advent of Computing

<p>In 1933 Konrad Zuse, a German civil engineer, caught the computing bug. It would consume the rest of his life. According Zuse he invented the world's first digital computer during WWII, working in near total isolation within the Third Reich. How true is this claim? Today we are looking at Zuse's early machines, the Z1, Z2, and Z3.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p>The Computer -- My Life, by Konrad Zuse</p> <p><a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1886">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1886</a> - Z1 Architecture paper by Rojas</p> <p><a href= "https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/85.707574">https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/85.707574</a> - Z3...

## FN60G WE is Mac Studio-like mini PC with up to NVIDIA RTX 4090M and Intel Core i9-14900KF

date: 2024-11-10, from: Liliputing

<p>The FEVM FN60G is a small desktop computer that looks a lot like a Mac Studio. But it&#8217;s designed for Windows (or other operating systems) and it&#8217;s a lot easier to customize or upgrade than a Mac Studio.

The Dems stopped campaigning against Trump after winning the 2020 election and Trump never stopped. They failed to even see this. And it costs so little to keep the party on the air on social web. Highest priority now -- getting back on the air. Such a stupid unforced error. Blind.
