only after a failed cache hit did we have to actually go to the

<h2 id="finally-a-replacement-for-bert-introducing-modernbert">Finally,
a replacement for BERT: Introducing ModernBERT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-12-19-modernbert.html">Finally,
a replacement for BERT: Introducing ModernBERT</a></strong>
</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>
was an early language model released by Google in October 2018. Unlike
modern LLMs it wasn’t designed for generating text. BERT was trained for
masked token prediction and was generally applied to problems like Named
Entity Recognition or Sentiment Analysis. BERT also wasn’t very useful
on its own - most applications required you to fine-tune a model on top
of it.
</p>
<p>
In exploring BERT I decided to try out
<a href="https://huggingface.co/dslim/distilbert-NER">dslim/distilbert-NER</a>,
a popular Named Entity Recognition model fine-tuned on top of DistilBERT
(a smaller distilled version of the original BERT model).
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/bert-ner">Here are my
notes</a> on running that using <code>uv run</code>.
</p>
<p>
Jeremy Howard’s <a href="https://www.answer.ai/">Answer.AI</a> research
group, <a href="https://www.lighton.ai/">LightOn</a> and friends
supported the development of ModernBERT, a brand new BERT-style model
that applies many enhancements from the past six years of advances in
this space.
</p>
<p>
While BERT was trained on 3.3 billion tokens, producing 110 million and
340 million parameter models, ModernBERT trained on 2 trillion tokens,
resulting in 140 million and 395 million parameter models. The parameter
count hasn’t increased much because it’s designed to run on lower-end
hardware. It has a 8192 token context length, a significant improvement
on BERT’s 512.
</p>
<p>
I was able to run one of the demos from the announcement post using
<code>uv run</code> like this (I’m not sure why I had to use
<code>numpy&lt;2.0</code> but without that I got an error about
<code>cannot import name ‘ComplexWarning’ from
‘numpy.core.numeric’</code>):
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>numpy&lt;2.0<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> --with torch --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> python</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then this Python:

<p>I’m looking forward to trying out models that use ModernBERT as their
base. The model release is accompanied by a paper

Longer: A Modern Bidirectional Encoder for Fast, Memory Efficient, and
Long Context Finetuning and Inference</a>) and

documentation</a> for using it with the Transformers library.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th
Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the
fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the
far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance
filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that
(1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor
of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not
automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete
evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the
likelihood of it developing.</p>

There’s been a lot of strange reporting recently about how ‘scaling is
hitting a wall’ – in a very narrow sense this is true in that larger
models were getting less score improvement on challenging benchmarks
than their predecessors, but in a larger sense this is false –
techniques like those which power O3 means scaling is continuing (and if
anything the curve has steepened), you just now need to account for
scaling both within the training of the model and in the compute you
spend on it once trained.

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-improve-clang-doc">GSoC 2024: Improve Clang Doc</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hi, my name is Peter, and this year I was involved in Google Summer of
Code 2024. I worked on
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/improve-Clang-Doc-usability/76996">improving
the Clang-Doc documenation generator</a>
</p>
<p>
Mentors: Petr Hosek and Paul Kirth
</p>
<h2 id="project-background">
Project Background
</h2>
<p>
Clang-Doc is a documentation generator developed on top of libtooling,
as analternative to Doxygen. Development started in 2018 and continued
through 2019,however, it has since stalled. Currently, the tool can
generate HTML, YAML, and markdown but the generated output has usability
issues. This GSOC project aimed to address the pain points regarding the
output of the HTML, by adding support for various C++ constructs and
reworking the CSS of the HTML output to be more user-friendly.
</p>
<h2 id="work-done">
Work Done
</h2>
<p>
The original scope of the project was to improve the output of
Clang-Doc’s generation. However during testing the tool was
significantly slower than expected which made developing features for
the tool impossible.Documentation generation for the LLVM codebase was
taking upwards of 10 hours on my local machine. Additionally, the tool
utilized a lot of memory and was prone to crashing with an out-of-memory
error. Similar tools such as Doxygen and Hdoc ran in comparatively less
time for the same codebase. This pointed to a significant bottleneck
within Clang-Doc’s code path when generating large-scale software
projects. Due to this the project scope quickly changed to improving the
runtime of Clang-Doc so that it could run much faster. It was only
during the latter half of the project did the scope changed back to
improving Clang-Doc’s generation.
</p>
<h3 id="added-more-test-cases-to-clang-doc-test-suite">
Added More Test Cases to Clang-Doc test suite
</h3>
<p>
Clang-Doc previously had tests which did not test the full scope of the
the HTML or Markdown output. I added more end-to-end tests to make sure
that in the process of optimizing documentation generation we were not
degrading the quality or functionality of the tool.
</p>
<p>
In summary, I added four comprehensive tests that covered all features
that we were not testing such as testing the generation for Enums,
Namespace, and Records for HTML and Markdown.
</p>
<h3 id="improve-clang-docs-performance-by-158-times">
Improve Clang-Doc’s performance by 1.58 times
</h3>
<p>
Internally, the way Clang-Doc works is by leveraging libtooling’s
ASTVisitor class to parse the source level declarations in each TU.
</p>
<p>
The tool is architected using a Map-Reduce pattern. Clang-Doc parses
each fragment of a declaration into an in-memory data format which is
serialized then into an internal format and stored as a key value
paired, identified by their
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX__CURSOR__XREF.html#ga51679cb755bbd94cc5e9476c685f2df3">USR</a>.
After, Clang-Doc deserializes and combines each of the fragment
declarations back into the in-memory data format which is used by each
of the backend to generate the results.
</p>
<p>
Many experiments were conducted to identified the source of the
bottleneck. First I tried benchmarking the code with many different
codebases such JSON, and fmtlib to identify certain code patterns that
slowed the code path down. This didn’t really work since the
bottlenecking only showed up for large codebases like LLVM.Next I
leverage Windows prolifer (since I was coding on windows) however the
visualizations was not helpful and the my system was not capable of
profiling the 10 hour runtime required to compile LLVM documenation.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, we were able to identify a major bottleneck in Clang-Doc’s
by leveraging the TimeProfiler (similar to -ftime-trace in clang) code
to identify where the performance bottleneck was. Clang-Doc was
performing redundant work when it was processing each declaration. We
settled on a caching/memoization strategy to minimize the redundant
work.
</p>
<p>
For example, if we had the following project:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">//File: Base.h</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Base</span> {}</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">//File: A.cpp</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&#34;Base.h&#34;</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">//File: B.cpp</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&#34;Base.h&#34;</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>...</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
In this case, the ASTVisitor invoked by Clang-Doc would visit the
serialized Base class three times, once when it is parsing Base.h,
another when its visiting A.cpp then B.cpp. The problem was that there
was no mechanism to identify declarations that we had already seen.
Using a simple dictionary which kept track of a list of declaration that
Clang-Doc had visited as a basic form of memoization ended up being a
surprisingly effective optimization.
</p>
<p>
Here is a plot of the benchmarking numbers:
</p>
<div style="margin:0 auto;">
<img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/clang-doc-benchmark-numbers.png"><br/>
</div>
<p>
The benchmarking numbers were performed on a machine with a 6th gen
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.00GHz w/ 96 cores, and 180GB of ram. Clang-doc
is able to run concurrently, however the benchmark here is with
concurrency set to 2. This is because anything higher crashes the slow
version of the tool with an out of memory error. It took around 6 hours
to complete a full generation of LLVM documentation in the previous
tool, where as current version took around 4 hours.
</p>
<p>
Here is a plot of the benchmark by number of threads:
</p>
<div style="margin:0 auto;">
<img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/clang-doc-concurrency.png"><br/>
</div>
<p>
We notice a pretty dramatic dropoff as more and more threads are
utilize, the original time t 6 hours was cut down to 13 minutes at 64
threads. Considering the previous versions of the tool could not use the
higher thread count without crashing (even on a machine with 180GB of
ram), the performance gains are even more dramatic.
</p>
<h3 id="added-template-mustache-html-backend">
Added Template Mustache HTML Backend
</h3>
<p>
Clang-Doc originally used an ad-hoc method of generating HTML. I
introduced a templating language as a way of reducing project complexity
and reducing the ease of development. Two RFCs were made before arriving
at the idea of introducing Mustache as a library. Originally the idea
was to introduce a custom templating language, however, upon further
discussion, it was decided that the complexity of designing and
implementing a new templating language was too much.An LLVM community
member (<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/u/cor3ntin/summary"><span
class="citation" data-cites="cor3ntin">@cor3ntin</span></a>) suggested
using Mustache as a templating language.Mustache was the ideal choice
since it was very simple to implement, and has a well defined spec that
fit what was needed for Clang-Doc’s use case. The feedback on the
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-add-template-mustache-language-to-the-support-library/82439/18">RFC</a>
was generally positive. While there was some resistance regarding the
inclusion of an HTML support library in LLVM, this concern stemmed
partly from a lack of awareness that HTML generation already occurs in
several parts of LLVM. Additionally, the introduction of Mustache has
the potential to simplify other HTML-related use cases.In terms of
engineering wins, this library was able to cut the direct down on the
HTML backend significantly dropping 500 lines of code compared to the
original Clang-Doc HTML backend. This library was also designed for
general-purpose use around LLVM since there are numerous places in LLVM
where various tools generate HTML in its way. Using the Mustache
templating library would be a nice way to standardize the codebase.
</p>
<h3 id="improve-clang-doc-html-output">
Improve Clang-Doc HTML Output
</h3>
<p>
The previous version of Clang-Doc’s HTML output was a pretty minimal,
bare bones implementation. It had a sidebar that contained every single
declaration within the project which created a large unnavigable UI.
Typedef documentation was missing, plus method documentation was missing
details such as whether or not the method was a const or virtual. There
was no linking between other declarations in the project and there was
no syntax highlighting on any language construct.
</p>
<p>
With the new Mustache changes an additional backend was added using the
specifier (–format=mhtml). That addresses these issues.
</p>
<p>
Below is a comparison of the same output between the two backends

<h2 id="learning-insight">
Learning Insight
</h2>
<p>
I’ve learned a lot in the past few months, thanks to GSOC I now have a
much better idea of what it’s like to participate in a large open-source
project. I received a lot of feedback through PRs, making RFC, and
collaborating with other GSOC members. I learned a lot about how to
interact with the community and solicit feedback. I also learned a lot
about instrumentation/profiling code having conducted many experiments
to try to speed Clang-Doc up.
</p>
<h2 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h2>
<p>
As my work concluded I was named as one of the maintainers of the
project. In the future I plan to work on Clang-Doc until an MVP product
can be generated and evaluated for the LLVM project. My remaining tasks
include landing the Mustache support library and Clang-Doc’s Mustache
backend, as well as gathering feedback from the LLVM community regarding
Clang-Doc’s current output. Additionally, I intend to add test cases for
the Mustache HTML backend to ensure its robustness and functionality.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Overall the current state of Clang-Doc is much healthier than it was
before. It now has much better test coverage across all its output,
markdown, html, yaml. Whereas previously there were no e2e test cases
that were not as comprehensive. The tool is significantly faster
especially for large scale projects like LLVM making documentation
generation and development a much better experience.The tool also has a
simplified HTML backend that will be much easier to work with compared
to before leading to a faster velocity for development.
