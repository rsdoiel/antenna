id="hunter-bidens-lawyers-rest-their-defense-in-trial-on-federal-gun-charges">Hunter
Biden’s lawyers rest their defense in trial on federal gun charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Hunter Biden’s lawyers rested their case
Monday in the federal criminal trial of the president’s son, who is
accused of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun in 2018,
according to news reports. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have argued the evidence is clear that Hunter Biden was
in the throes of addiction when he checked “no” on the form at the gun
shop that asked whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to”
drugs. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s addiction struggles before getting sober more than
five years ago are well documented. But defense lawyers argued that
prosecutors failed to prove he was using drugs in the 11 days that he
possessed the gun. </p>
<p>The defense has suggested Hunter Biden had been trying to turn his
life around at the time, completing a detoxification and rehabilitation
program at the end of August 2018. His daughter Naomi took the stand for
the defense last week, telling jurors about visiting him while he was at
a California rehab center weeks before he bought the gun.</p>
<p>The defense also tried to cast doubt on the memories of the
prosecution’s witnesses, pressing them about their recollection of
events. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was charged with three felonies: lying to a federally
licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying
he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. He has
pleaded not guilty, </p>
<p>It’s the first of two trials for Hunter Biden in the midst of his
father’s Democratic reelection campaign. He also is charged with failing
to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes in a case scheduled to go to trial
in September in California. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden has accused the Justice Department of bending to
political pressure from former President Donald Trump and other
Republicans to bring the gun case and the separate tax charges after a
deal with prosecutors fell apart last year. </p>
<p>The case has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden’s
life after the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction before getting sober more
than five years ago are well documented. But defense lawyers argue
there’s no evidence he was actually using drugs in the 11 days that he
possessed the gun. He had completed a rehab program weeks earlier. </p>
<p>Jurors have heard emotional testimony from Hunter Biden’s former
romantic partners and read personal text messages. They’ve seen photos
of Hunter Biden holding a crack pipe and partly clothed, and video from
his phone of crack cocaine weighed on a scale. </p>
<p>His ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors
about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get
clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she
worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she
stayed with him at a hotel. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden has not taken the witness stand. But jurors have heard
him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts
played in court of his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things.” The book,
written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t
mention it specifically. </p>
<p>A key witness for prosecutors is Beau’s widow, Hallie, who had a
brief troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother died of brain
cancer. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018,
panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in
Wilmington, where a man inadvertently fished it out of the trash. </p>
<p>“I didn’t want him to hurt himself, and I didn’t want my kids to find
it and hurt themselves,” Hallie Biden told jurors.</p>
<p>From the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to
California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using
drugs, Hallie told jurors. That time period included the day he bought
the weapon. But jurors also saw text messages Hunter sent to Hallie in
October 2018 saying he was waiting for a dealer and smoking crack. The
first message was sent the day after he bought the gun. The second was
sent the following day. </p>
<p>The defense has suggested Hunter Biden had been trying to turn his
life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a
detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August
2018. </p>
<p>“There is no evidence of contemporaneous drug use and a gun
possession,” defense lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court papers filed
Friday. “It was only after the gun was thrown away and the ensuing
stress … that the government was able to then find the same type of
evidence of his use (e.g., photos, use of drug lingo) that he relapsed
with drugs.” </p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s daughter Naomi took the stand for the defense Friday,
telling jurors about visiting her father while he was at a California
rehab center weeks before he bought the gun. She told jurors that he
seemed “hopeful” and to be improving, and she told him she was proud of
him. As she was dismissed from the stand, she paused to hug her dad
before leaving the courtroom. </p>
<p>The defense on Friday did not rule out calling one more witness, but
it was unclear who that could be. Hunter’s lawyers previously said they
planned to call as a witness Joe Biden’s brother, James, and he was at
the courthouse on Friday. Testimony from other family members could open
the door for more deeply personal messages to be introduced to the
jury. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s
verdict and has ruled out a pardon for his son. After flying back from
France, President Biden was at his home in Wilmington for the day and
was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He
was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven
leaders conference. </p>
<p>Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in
the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after U.S.
District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by
Republican former President Donald Trump, raised concerns about it.
Hunter Biden was subsequently indicted on three felony gun charges. He
also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he
failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years. </p>
<p>If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison,
though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and
it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p>

<h2 id="void-linux-on-zfs">Void Linux on ZFS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last night, I ran through the ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for
Void and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD
plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea
of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box,
so the Void Handbook itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation
before its own (a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a
ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we’ll be
following throughout this post. ↫ Juno Takano There’s a ton of good
stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers
Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy
style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily
underappreciated – it gets a lot of mentions in the right places – but I
do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a
perfect fit but who don’t yet know about it. So, time for a very short
introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very
user-friendly package manager that’s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many
other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are
vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you’ll be hard-pressed
to be asking for some piece of software that isn’t packaged. Void
eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no
issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line
with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void
also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the “real” Void Linux is
the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu.
The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it’s a
self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux
kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be
launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier,
especially for systems that don’t over ZFS as an option during
installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that’s what the linked
post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation.
It’s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.</p>

MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it
is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and
dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without
running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching
how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode
compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned
through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a
specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for
“filling in the blanks” when executing code to understand what the code
should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64
assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly
in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to
launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach
a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing.
Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process
as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the
virtualization firmware. ↫ Nicholas Starke This is an old post – from
late 2022 – but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS
doesn’t change very much from year to year, it’s still mostly
relevant.</p>

Unsurprising but also immoral: these respondents believed that
subsequent layoffs were undertaken because too few people quit in the
wake of return to office policies.

This quote from the company that conducted the survey seems obviously
true to me:

“The mental and emotional burdens workers face today are real, and the
companies who seek employee feedback with the intent to listen and
improve are the ones who will win.”

Politico Owner Launches New Journalism Finishing School To Try And Fix
All The ‘Wokeness’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;

<p>
“There’s an ocean of problems with journalism, but the idea that there’s
just too damn much woke progressivism is utter delusion. U.S. journalism
generally tilts center right on the political spectrum.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a story about the founder of Politico creating a “teaching
hospital for journalists” that appears to be in opposition to
“wokeness”. But it’s also about much of the state of incumbent
journalism, which is still grappling with the wave of much-needed social
change that is inspiring movements around the world.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In the wake of Black Lives Matter and COVID there was some fleeting
recommendations to the ivy league establishment media that we could
perhaps take a slightly more well-rounded, inclusive approach to
journalism. In response, the trust fund lords in charge of these
establishment outlets lost their […] minds, started crying incessantly
about young journalists “needing safe spaces,” and decided to double
down on all their worst impulses, having learned less than nothing along
the way.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Exactly. Asinine efforts like anti-woke journalism schools aren’t what
we need; we need better intersectional representation inside newsrooms,
we need better representation of the real stories that need to be told
across the country and across the world, and we need to dismantle
institutional systems that have acted as gatekeepers for generations.
</p>
<p>
All power to the outlets, independent journalists, and foundations that
are truly trying to push for something better. The status quo is not -
and has not been - worth preserving.

needs Japan’s help to boost military production, ambassador says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — The United States needs Japan’s help to cope with strategic
challenges in Europe and Asia that are straining its defense industries,
the U.S. ambassador to Japan said on Monday as the countries kicked off
talks on military industrial cooperation.</p>
<p>“Our national security strategy calls for us to be able to handle one
and a half theaters, that’s a major war and another one to a stand-off,
and with both the Middle East, Ukraine, and keeping our deterrence
credible in this region (East Asia) you can already see that we are in
two plus,” Rahm Emanuel told reporters. </p>
<p>On Sunday, Japan and the U.S. kicked off their first talks in Tokyo
on forging deeper defense industry collaboration under the U.S.-Japan
Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition and Sustainment
(DICAS) established in April by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida
and U.S. President Joe Biden.  </p>
<p>Discussions on Tuesday between U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment William A. LaPlante and Masaki Fukasawa, the
head of Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency, will
focus on naval repairs in Japan that could help free up U.S. yards to
build more warships.</p>
<p>“China has a major capacity we already know that will surpass us on
new shipbuilding,” Emanuel said.  </p>
<p>Other potential cooperation between Japan and the U.S. includes
aircraft repairs, missile production and military supply chain
resilience, he added.</p>
<p>Japan and the U.S. already build a missile defense interceptor
together and Tokyo has also agreed to supply Patriot PAC3 air-defense
missiles to the U.S.</p>

<p>
Early results from the European parliament elections that took place
over the last few days show right-wing parties making gains and green
parties sitting among the

losers</a>.” Obviously this shift could have implications for EU climate
law: The bloc has a number of ambitious clean energy and emissions
targets in line for 2030, but many green policies (including a planned
2035 phase-out of new gas-powered vehicles) are up for review soon and
“a more climate-skeptical EU parliament could attempt to add loopholes
to weaken those laws,”

<em><em>Reuters</em></em>. The parliament will also help outline new
2040 emissions targets for EU countries, and “that goal will set the
course for a future wave of policies to curb emissions in the 2030s in
every sector, from farming, to manufacturing, to transport.” Still, the
tone remains pretty optimistic. Environment and climate ministers

Contrary to the rest of the U.S. tech industry, the market for climate
mitigation solutions has boomed of late<em><em>. </em></em>Since 2022,

<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/documenting-a-decade-of-cost-declines-for-pv-systems.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>82%</u></a>
over the past decade. Globally, the world now invests almost
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/overview-and-key-findings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>twice
as much</u></a> in clean energy as it does in oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
The period has not been quite so fecund for adaptation solutions,
however. Whereas mitigation technologies focus on cutting emissions,
adaptation and resilience focuses on solutions that can reduce the risks
and impacts of climate change. Although Bank of America analysts
predicted four years ago that adaptation and resilience could become a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/why-investing-in-climate-adaptation-will-soon-be-very-profitable-green-insight" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2
trillion</u></a> market by 2026, annual investment grew just 28% in 2022
to
<a href="https://gca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/State-and-Trends-in-Climate-Adaptation-Finance-2023_WEB.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$63
billion</u></a>. In that same time, financing for mitigation
technologies reached $1.2 trillion.
</p>
<p>
The main distinguishing factor between the two approaches to climate
tech: Where the money is coming from. While global mitigation spending
is generally shared evenly between the public and private sector,
<a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>98%</u></a>
of adaptation finance comes from the public sector. Without the profit
motive to drive down costs, many solutions don’t make financial sense
for investors. “Our targeting is better but the cost curve has not been
substantially cut,” said Ali Zaidi, the president’s chief climate
advisor, at the Innovations in Climate Resilience conference in April.
We’ve made progress, he said, but “we haven’t cut it by a factor of four
or a factor of eight — that’s the kind of progress we’ve made on
mitigation technology, but not in the arena of resilience.”
</p>
<p>
Sonam Velani, co-founder of Streetlife Ventures and an early investor in
adaptation solutions, told me that, “traditionally, adaptation has been
seen as a government problem. But today, more and more businesses are
actually coming to solve those solutions.” The new climate
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disclosure
rules</u></a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission put
further pressure on companies to understand their products’ climate
impact. “If you look at a lot of the climate-related disclosures that
are now being required,” Velani said, “companies are actually required
to understand climate risk and what impact that has on their bottom
line,” and making that information public drives accountability.
</p>
<p>
In early April, a coalition consisting of the Bezos Earth Fund, the
philanthropic ClimateWorks Foundation, impact-focused private equity
firm the Lightsmith Group, and MSCI Sustainability Institute issued a
new report called
“<a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/66c2ce28-dc91-4dc1-a0e1-a47d9ecdc17d/downloads/GARI%202024%20-%20Investing%20in%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20.pdf?ver=1710422174956" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Unavoidable Opportunity</u></a>,” aiming to understand the private
sector adaptation opportunity. Jay Koh, Managing Director of the
Lightsmith Group, said the title was inspired by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s
<a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6/wg2/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>own
language</u></a> on adaptation. “Climate resilience investments can be
made at scale,” the report determined, “including in publicly traded
companies.”
</p>
<p>
MSCI said its model “builds on existing definitions and approaches to
identifying adaptation companies,” including the EU’s taxonomy of
sustainable economic activities, then used a large language model to
scour companies’ annual reports for products and services that
qualified. MSCI considered the companies adaptation and resilience
investments only if they were in the business of adaptation, as opposed
to simply “taking measures to make their operations more internally
resilient.” By that metric, 827 companies, or more than 11% of publicly
traded entities in developed markets, could be considered adaptation
solutions.
</p>
<p>
All these new green opportunities didn’t sprout from thin air. The idea
is to push back the “investment frontier” for adaptation — to broaden
the classification beyond solely “pure play” companies focused
explicitly and exclusively on climate adaptations to include those with
multi-use products — and thereby bring in more capital. The same is true
in the mitigation market, where examples are more plentiful. Take
Siemens, for instance. The German conglomerate that sells everything
from healthcare IT to dishwashers; it also happens to be a leader in
offshore wind energy. Despite no mention of climate mitigation in
Siemens’ mission or sustainability tagline on their homepage, they are
still a key player in climate mitigation technologies.
</p>
<p>
Katie MacDonald is a co-founder of Tailwind, a research and investment
firm focused on accelerating the deployment of climate adaptation and
resilience solutions. She told me that “most companies don’t call what
they do adaptation or resilience.” In fact, she said, “most of the
companies and solutions we’ve spoken to so far don’t call themselves
climate change anything — they call themselves risk management or
agriculture analytics or supply chain or healthcare diagnostics.”
</p>
<p>
The MSCI report sets out a list of qualifiers to help investors better
understand what adaptation is, but — crucially — stops short of saying
what adaptation <em><em>isn’t</em></em>. Koh explains the thinking. “We
think it’s very early in the development of adaptation to consider”
excluding any business in particular. “If we would had said early on
that decarbonization only means solar panels, then we would have never
opened up our minds enough to decarbonize agriculture, transportation,
and buildings.”
</p>
<p>
While climate impacts will be felt across all areas of the economy,
tagging such a wide range of companies as climate adaptation solutions
could leave the space vulnerable to greenwashing. The report uses pipes
as an example. Pipes are critical for resilience tasks such as
stormwater drainage and irrigation. But the same companies also sell
pipes oil fields.
</p>
<p>
There are existing standards that can help answer these questions. The
UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, for example, codified in 2015 at
the landmark UN Sustainable Development Summit, provided a framework for
organizations to measure their contributions across climate impact
areas. There are also more complex metrics such as adaptive capacity,
which measures, for instance, how much excess heat a crop can withstand
before its yields begin to decline.
</p>
<p>
MacDonald told me she can envision other outcome-based metrics, as well.
“Whether it’s looking at reduced negative health outcomes and mortality
or increased asset health and functionality, there are a myriad of ways
we can measure the presence of a climate resilience benefit,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The MSCI team hopes the report’s findings can enable investors and
portfolio managers to create an investing strategy that encompasses
every size of company including seed, venture, growth, and listed
equities. Koh emphasizes that investing in adaptation isn’t a matter of
wondering what the business models will be or waiting for new startups
to appear. The report shows that there’s already an identifiable set of
public companies that could make up an investment strategy for your
existing 401k, pension plan, or portfolio.
</p>
<p>
The point is not merely to recharacterize more investing as
adaptation-related, inflating the statistics with no real change in
fortune for businesses and governments attempting to fortify themselves
against the climate of the future. The point is for private capital to
drive demand for solutions that not only prevent immense losses but
foster a higher quality of life for billions of people.
</p>
<p>
“You actually know more right now about how climate change will unfold
between now and 2040 than you do about the rate of inflation, interest
rates, AI, consumer behavior or the betting odds on who Taylor Swift
will be dating next,” Koh told me as he walked through the report’s
findings. “We think that leads to an unavoidable opportunity,” though he
added a caveat: “I believe these statistics were made before Travis
Kelce.”

drops of aid into northern Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — An American cargo plane dropped more than 10 metric tons
of rations into northern Gaza on Sunday, the U.S. military said, after a
suspension of such deliveries due to Israeli operations in the area.</p>
<p>Gaza’s population is in dire need of humanitarian assistance after
eight months of devastating conflict, and the United States turned to
delivering it by air and sea as Israel delayed the entry of aid via
land.</p>
<p>The air drop provided “life-saving humanitarian assistance in
northern Gaza,” the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“To date, the U.S. has airdropped more than 1,050 metric tons of
humanitarian assistance” in addition to aid delivered via a temporary
pier attached to the Gaza coast, it said.</p>
<p>“These airdrops are part of a sustained effort, and we continue to
plan follow-on aerial deliveries,” CENTCOM added. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said in late May that factors including Israeli
operations and weather conditions were affecting the drops, while deputy
CENTCOM commander Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said Friday that they had
been “suspended due to the kinetic operations happening in the north”
but were expected to resume soon. </p>
<p>The latest air drop came a day after aid deliveries were restarted
via the pier, which was damaged by bad weather last month and had to be
repaired in a nearby port before being reattached to the coast. </p>
<p>Gaza is suffering through its bloodiest-ever war, which broke out
after Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the
deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally
based on Israeli official figures. </p>
<p>Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in
Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory’s
health ministry.</p>

<h2 id="ldap2pg-6.1-postgres-16-unprivileged-hooks-and-more">ldap2pg
6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>
Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France
since 2005.
</p>
<p>
Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers
the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for
PostgreSQL. Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in
<code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure
roles from your enterprise directory.
</p>
<p>
Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1. This version
brings support for PostgreSQL 16 and its new unprivileged administration
or roles. Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make
this a practical and stable version. Follow the
<a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation
to install</a> this new version.
</p>
<h3>
Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to
delegating the administration of roles to an unprivileged user. This
change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security and was not consistent with the SQL
standard. Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de
facto grant himself rights he does not have.
</p>
<p>
Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL
up to version 15. ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code>
option on PostgreSQL 16, without superuser privileges.
</p>
<h3>
Configurability
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities. You can now write the
environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file or in the ldap2pg working directory.
</p>
<p>
In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working
directory of the command. This parameter determines the search for the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.
</p>
<p>
Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument: the connection
string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised. This connection
string can be in URL format or in key=value format.
</p>
<h3>
Compatibility
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after
connection to the LDAP directory. This operation is an extension of the
LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere. Removing this command
removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.
</p>
<p>
The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by
a space. If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this
client-side HA implementation.
</p>
<p>
LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol, only for ASCII characters. ldap2pg
6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.
</p>
<h3>
Execution hooks
</h3>
<p>
A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg : the
definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after
the creation of a role. For example, to create a schema specific to a
new user. The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code>
and <code>after_create</code> parameters. These requests can receive
dynamic values from the LDAP search.
</p>
<h3>
Continue on error
</h3>
<p>
Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing. For
example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving
up.

<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn’t
shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel,
then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling
and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0,
because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There’s a
slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me
for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what
PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ↫ David Anderson What a
great read. Just great.</p>

terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI
training</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that
they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some
frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming
rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the
apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the
apps, without agreeing to the terms. ↫ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course
users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language,
locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms
is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers
certainly aren’t going to be particularly happy about. I’ve never worked
an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I’m assuming
employees aren’t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe
or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash,
Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim
ownership over anyone’s work, and that it’s not going to train its ML
models on customers’ work either. The company states that to train its
Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it,
as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth,
it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which
is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI
or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly
licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from
rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that’s exactly
what they’re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just
how – rightfully – weary people are of machine learning, and how their
works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.</p>

And I love it.

Ghost’s newsletter / blog about building ActivityPub support into its

I’ve always been into. Here it’s done with great humor. Also, they
really seem to be into pugs, and that’s cool, too.

<p>
In this week’s entry the team is investigating using existing
ActivityPub libraries and frameworks rather than building the whole
thing from scratch themselves - and doing it with not a small amount of
humility.
</p>
<p>
And they’re building a front-end to allow bloggers to consume content
from other people who publish long-form content onto the web using
ActivityPub. I’m excited to see it take shape.

Yay for link blogs! I’ve been finding this particularly rewarding.
You’re reading a post from mine right now.

<p>
Kellan wrote his own software to do this, based on links stored in
Pinboard. Mine is based on Notion: I write an entry in markdown, which
then seeds integrations that convert the bookmark into an HTML post on
my website and various text posts for social media.

<p>
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/9/a-link-blog-in-the-year-2024/">Simon
Willison has noted that adding markdown support has meant he writes
longer entries</a>; that’s been true for me, too. It’s really
convenient.
</p>
<p>
Most of all: I love learning from people I connect, follow, and
subscribe to. Particularly in a world where search engines are falling
apart as a way to really discover new writers and sources, link blogs
are incredibly useful. It’s lovely to find another one.

<h2 id="its-time-to-get-real-im-not-25-anymore">It’s time to get real:
I’m not 25 anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
Last week, without warning, my back went “crunch”.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been dealing with what feels like a painful, bruised coccyx ever
since. It should heal up within a few weeks, but until then, getting up
from a sitting or lying position is really hard, walking has been
awkward, and I haven’t been able to pick up anything particularly heavy
(like, just for example, a toddler who happens to be in the 99th
percentile for his height).
</p>
<p>
I’m used to my body more or less working properly — and now it just
doesn’t. It’s been unsettling. In the scheme of things, it’s much less
problematic than the injuries a lot of people have to deal with, but
it’s also a wake-up call.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I think I need to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Commit to radically losing some weight. My weight when I arrived in
California was 196 pounds. The last time I weighed in, it was something
like 260.
</li>
<li>
Gain some strength and flexibility. Once my coccyx is healed I intend to
start taking home fitness more seriously, and also (finally) get into
yoga.
</li>
<li>
Actually use my fancy standing desk. I need to spend more of my time
standing rather than sitting, and aim to stand for at least 60% of my
day.
</li>
<li>
When I <em>am</em> sitting, I need to take my posture seriously.
<a href="https://werd.io/2023/my-setup-october-2023">I’ve been sitting
on</a> a Wit SitOnIt task chair (the same kind we used to have at
Matter), but I need something with more lumbar and posture support. Not
least because the back support strip went “ping” a little while ago and
I’ve been sitting with almost nothing behind me.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So. Changes afoot:
</p>
<p>
I’m upgrading my chair to a
<a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100073872">Herman
Miller Aeron</a>, which is stereotypical for a reason: it’s far better
for posture. I managed to find it at a surplus store for a very deep
discount on its eye-watering usual price.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be standing for most of my day. If you’re in a meeting with me, you
can expect me to be bouncing around.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be taking more care about what I eat, mostly by trying to go for
less calorie-dense food. In a significant change to my California
lifestyle, I already don’t eat out much. But there’s more I can do: in
particular, the more fresh vegetables I can include, the better.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to try and resume my walking habit: a long walk at night,
listening to podcasts or audiobooks.
</p>
<p>
And yoga. Which I am terrified of. My relationship with my body is
fraught. I’ve never been proud of it and I don’t think I can make it do
very much. So as challenging as the stretching itself might be, the
psychological component is pretty much the hardest thing to get over.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I’m not 25 anymore. In itself, that’s a painful sentence
to have to type. But here I am, firmly entering middle age, and I want
to be around for a long time to come.
</p>
<p>
These changes might be challenging — both in themselves and as habits to
stick to — but it’s clearly past time that I do something. My painful
back is a small signal; without intervention, I expect others to follow.
It’s time to get real.

Will Smith-Martin Lawrence action-comedy series, opened with an
estimated $56 million in theaters over the weekend, handing Hollywood a
much-needed summer hit and Smith his biggest success since he slapped
Chris Rock at the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Expectations were all over the map for “Ride or Die” given the dismal
moviegoing market thus far this summer and Smith’s less certain
box-office clout. In the end, though, the Sony Pictures release came in
very close to, or slightly above, its tracking forecast.</p>
<p>“Ride or Die,” produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Adil El
Arbi and Bilall Fallah, is Smith’s first theatrical test since his 2022
slap of Rock earned him a 10-year Oscar ban. The “Bad Boys” film was in
development at the time and was momentarily put on hold, but ultimately
went forward with about a $100 million production budget.</p>
<p>Smith starred in the Apple release “Emancipation,” but that film —
released in late 2022 — was shot before the slap and received only a
modest theatrical release before streaming.</p>
<p>This time around, Smith largely avoided soul-searching interviews
looking back on the Oscars and instead went on a whistle-stop publicity
tour of red carpets from Mexico to Saudi Arabia, where he attended what
was billed as the country’s first Hollywood premiere. The 55-year-old
Smith, who for years was one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars,
appeared on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,” the YouTube series
“Hot Ones” and Friday, made a surprise appearance at a Los Angeles movie
theater.</p>
<p>Given that “Bad Boys” trailed May disappointments like “Furiosa: A
Mad Max Saga” and “The Fall Guy” – both of which struggled to pop with
ticket buyers despite very good reviews – the “Ride or Die” opening
counts as a critical weekend win for the movie business.</p>
<p>“The fact that a movie overperformed is the best possible news,” said
Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like
all we’ve been doing over the past few weeks and almost since the
beginning of the year, with a couple of exceptions, is try to figure out
why seemingly well-marketed, well-reviewed movies have underperformed.
This ignites the spark that the industry has been waiting for.”</p>
<p>“Ride or Die” still didn’t quite manage to match the opening of the
previous “Bad Boys” film: 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life.” That movie,
released in January 2020, debuted with $62.5 million. After the pandemic
shut down theaters, it was the highest grossing North American release
of that year, with $204 million domestically.</p>
<p>“Ride or Die” added $48.6 million internationally. Though reviews
were mixed (64% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave the film a high
grade with an “A-” CinemaScore.</p>
<p>Black moviegoers accounted for 44% of ticket buyers, the largest
demographic.</p>
<p>In the film, which comes 29 years after the original, Smith and
Lawrence reprise their roles as Miami detectives. The plot revolves
around uncovering a scheme to frame their late police captain (Joe
Pantoliano). In one of the movie’s most notable scenes, Lawrence slaps
Smith and calls him a “bad boy.”</p>
<p>Movie theaters will need a lot more than “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,”
though, to right the ship. Ticket sales are down 26% from last year and
more than 40% below pre-pandemic totals, according to Comscore. A big
test comes next weekend with the release of Pixar’s “Inside Out 2.”
After sending several Pixar releases straight to Disney+, the studio has
vowed a lengthy, traditional theatrical rollout this time.</p>
<p>Last weekend’s top film “The Garfield Movie,” slid to second place.
Also from Sony, the family animated comedy collected $10 million in
ticket sales over its third weekend, bringing its domestic gross to
$68.6 million.</p>
<p>The weekend’s other new wide release, “The Watchers,” failed to click
with moviegoers. The horror film, directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan,
daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, is about a stranded 28-year-old artist
in Ireland. Following poor reviews, the Warner Bros. release grossed $7
million in 3,351 theaters.</p>
<p>That allowed “If,” the Ryan Reynolds imaginary friend fantasy, to
grab third place in its fourth weekend of release, bringing the
Paramount Pictures cumulative domestic total to $93.5 million. Rounding
out the top five was “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” which added
$5.4 million in its fifth weekend of release. It has grossed $150
million domestically and $360 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

id="mayorkas-biden-administration-ready-for-court-challenges-to-border-policy">Mayorkas:
Biden administration ready for court challenges to border policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden’s administration is prepared to
defend in court the sweeping asylum policy put into place at the
U.S.-Mexico border last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.</p>
<p>Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday that generally bars
migrants who illegally cross the southern border from claiming asylum
and allows authorities to quickly deport or send migrants back to Mexico
if the daily number of crossings exceeds 2,500. The asylum ban has
exceptions for unaccompanied minors, people who face serious medical or
safety threats, and victims of trafficking.</p>
<p>Mayorkas on Sunday said the administration was ready to defend the
policy against an expected American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
lawsuit.</p>
<p>“I respectfully disagree with the ACLU,” Mayorkas said. “We stand by
the legality of what we have done. We stand by the value proposition.
It’s not only a matter of securing the border, we have a humanitarian
obligation to keep vulnerable people out of the hands of exploitative
smugglers.”</p>
<p>The ACLU confirmed on Sunday it plans to sue.</p>
<p>“It was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,”
ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project Deputy Director Lee Gelernt said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Biden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Republican Donald
Trump’s restrictive policies but has grappled with record levels of
migrants caught crossing the border illegally ahead of the Nov. 5
presidential election.</p>
<p>Mayorkas said initial indications showed the new policy was deterring
some illegal immigration.</p>
<p>“It’s early. The signs are positive,” he said.</p>
<p>A U.S. border official told Reuters that authorities arrested around
3,100 people crossing illegally on Friday, down roughly 20% from the
days before. The official requested anonymity to discuss preliminary
figures.</p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who installed razor wire fencing along
the Rio Grande and has seen a state law to enforce illegal crossings
into his state blocked by a judge, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning
Futures” he thinks the policy is backfiring.</p>
<p>“All that this new Biden policy is going to do is to actually attract
and invite even more people to cross the border illegally,” Abbott
said.</p>

id="large-chunk-of-wyomings-teton-pass-road-collapses-unclear-how-quickly-it-can-be-rebuilt">Large
chunk of Wyoming’s Teton Pass road collapses; unclear how quickly it can
be rebuilt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JACKSON, Wyo. — A large chunk of a twisting mountain pass road
collapsed in Wyoming, authorities said Saturday, leaving a gaping chasm
in the highway and severing a well-traveled commuter link between small
towns in eastern Idaho and the tourist destination of Jackson.  </p>
<p>Aerial photos and drone video of the collapse show the Teton Pass
road riven with deep cracks, and a big section of the pavement
disappeared altogether. Part of the guardrail dangled into the void, and
orange traffic drums marked off the danger area. The road was closed at
the time of the collapse.  </p>
<p>The section that failed first drew attention Thursday when a crack
and drop in the road contributed to the crash of a motorcycle.  </p>
<p>Geologists and engineers who were sent to the area that day noticed
“that crack and that drop started to move a lot,” said Stephanie Harsha,
a spokesperson for District 3 of the Wyoming Department of
Transportation. A paving crew temporarily patched the road, and traffic
began moving again that night.   </p>
<p>But that was short-lived as maintenance crews were sent to respond to
a mudslide a couple of miles away in the pre-dawn hours of Friday,
prompting the road to be closed once again.  </p>
<p>Crews then noticed that the damage to the pavement had become more
pronounced. Workers trying to figure out a detour around that section
left for the night, “and by 5 a.m., this morning, WYDOT had discovered
that the road had completely failed,” Harsha said Saturday.  </p>
<p>“We were very, very lucky that no crews were harmed. No equipment was
damaged,” she said. “So now, engineers and geologists are doing
geological assessments on the pass. They’ve been looking at it all
day.”  </p>
<p>The transportation department said via social media that the road
“catastrophically failed” at milepost 12.8.  </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how long it will take to reopen the
road, a vital artery for people who live across the border in Idaho and
work in pricey Jackson, which is also close to the popular Grand Teton
National Park.  </p>
<p>Harsha said an alternate route between Jackson and the area of
Victor, Idaho, goes more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) out of the way
and adds “quite a bit to any commute.”  </p>
<p>Gov. Mark Gordon signed an executive order declaring an emergency,
which his office said would help the state access additional resources
from the Federal Highway Administration to begin repair work.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the governor said the transportation department is
working on “a long-term solution to rebuild this critical
roadway.”  </p>
<p>“I recognize the significant impacts this closure has to Teton County
residents, regional commuters and the local economy,” Gordon said.</p>

id="biden-honors-us-war-dead-with-cemetery-visit-ending-french-trip">Biden
honors US war dead with cemetery visit ending French trip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BELLEAU, France — President Joe Biden closed out his trip to France
by paying his respects at an American military cemetery that Donald
Trump notably skipped visiting when he was president, hoping his final
stop Sunday will draw the stakes of the November election in stark
relief.</p>
<p>Before returning to the United States, Biden honored America’s war
dead at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery about an hour outside Paris. He
placed a wreath at the cemetery chapel before an expanse of white
headstones marking the final resting place of more than 2,200 U.S.
soldiers who fought in World War I.</p>
<p>It was a solemn end to five days in which Trump was an unspoken yet
unavoidable presence. On the surface, the trip marked the 80th
anniversary of D-Day and celebrated the alliance between the United
States and France. But during an election year when Trump has called
into question fundamental understandings about America’s global role,
Biden has embraced his Republican predecessor — and would-be successor —
as a latent foil.</p>
<p>Every ode to the transatlantic partnership was a reminder that Trump
could upend those relationships. Each reference to democracy stood a
counterpoint to his rival’s efforts to overturn a presidential election.
The myriad exhortations to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia
created a contrast with Trump’s skepticism about providing U.S.
assistance.</p>
<p>Biden’s paeans to the struggle between democracy and autocracy drew
plaudits in Europe, where the prospect of a return to Trump’s turbulent
reign has sparked no shortage of anxiety. But it remains to be seen how
the message will resonate with American voters, as Biden’s campaign
struggles to connect the dire warnings the Democratic president so often
delivers about his rival with people’s daily concerns.</p>
<p>The visit to the cemetery served as a moment to underscore the
contrast once more.</p>
<p>“It’s the same story,” Biden said. “America showed up. America showed
up to stop the Germans. America showed up to make sure that they did not
prevail. And America shows up when we’re needed just like our allies
show for us.”</p>
<p>During a 2018 trip to France, Trump skipped plans to go to the
cemetery, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.
However, subsequent reports said that Trump told aides he didn’t want to
go because he viewed the dead soldiers as “suckers” and “losers.” Trump
has denied the comments, although they were later corroborated by his
chief of staff at the time, John Kelly.</p>
<p>Trump’s purported insults have become a regular feature of Biden’s
campaign speeches, including during an April rally in Scranton,
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served
this nation,” Biden said. “Believing otherwise, that alone is
disqualifying for someone to seek this office.”</p>
<p>Biden ignored a direct question about Trump at the cemetery. “The
idea that I would come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to
pay tribute,” he added, his voice trailing off as if to express
disbelief.</p>
<p>Maura Sullivan, a former Marine officer who served on the American
Battle Monuments Commission under President Barack Obama, said Biden’s
visit would “set the example, and do what a president should do.” Now an
official with the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Sullivan said that
“voters can draw their own conclusions” from that.</p>
<p>Biden’s trip was full of emotional moments, and the president grew
heavy-eyed after meeting with World War II veterans. A 21-gun salute
cast eerie smoke over 9,388 white marble headstones at the Normandy
American Cemetery.</p>
<p>“This has been the most remarkable trip that I’ve ever made,” Biden
said on Saturday night, his last in Paris before returning to the
U.S.</p>
<p>At Aisne-Marne, Biden said the trip “surprised me how much it
awakened my sense of why it’s so valuable to have these alliances. Why
it’s so critical. That’s the way you stop wars, not start wars.”</p>
<p>His remarks over the last few days were also freighted with political
overtones.</p>
<p>On Thursday at Normandy anniversary ceremonies, Biden said D-Day
served a reminder that alliances make the United States stronger,
calling it “a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.” He also
highlighted how the war effort drew on immigrants, women and people of
color who were too often overlooked by history.</p>
<p>Then on Friday, he went to Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the coast where
Army Rangers scaled cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses on D-Day that was
also the site in 1984 of one of President Ronald Reagan’s most memorable
speeches about the struggles between the West and the Soviet Union
during the Cold War.</p>
<p>By following in an iconic Republican’s footsteps, Biden honed his
appeal to traditional conservatives who are often frustrated by Trump’s
isolationist vision. Biden issued a call for Americans to protect
democracy like the Rangers who scaled the cliffs, a message that synced
with campaign rhetoric that paints his election opponent as an
existential threat to U.S. values.</p>
<p>While Biden was in France, his campaign announced that it had hired
the onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to
lead outreach to GOP voters. Kinzinger clashed with Trump’s foreign
policy and efforts to overturn the last presidential election.</p>
<p>At Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the Army Rangers “fought to vanquish a
hateful ideology in the ’30s and ’40s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t
move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?”</p>
<p>Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to devote more attention to its
own problems and less to foreign alliances and entanglements. He has
also routinely played down the importance of American partnerships,
suggesting the U.S. could abandon its treaty commitments to defend
European allies if they don’t pay enough for their own defenses.</p>
<p>Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who wrote a book about
Pointe du Hoc and Reagan’s speech, said Biden “had big shoes to step
into” by choosing the same location.</p>
<p>Biden’s speech “didn’t equal Reagan’s in grandeur, nor could it,”
Brinkley said. Still, he said Biden “said the right words about why
democracy matters.”</p>
<p>Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist, said it could help
Biden politically “to stand where Reagan stood.”</p>
<p>He noted that Biden is struggling with younger voters but appears to
be gaining strength among older ones who may be more receptive to
reminders of Reagan’s speech four decades ago.</p>
<p>“He needs a lot of Reagan Republicans to offset his challenges with
younger voters,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden’s trip was also punctuated by the pomp of a state visit in
Paris.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron arranged a ceremony at the Arc du
Triomphe, where four fighter jets flew overhead, and hosted a banquet at
the Elysee presidential palace.</p>
<p>“United we stand, divided we fall,” Macron said in toasting Biden.
“Allied we are, and allied we will stay.”</p>
<p>Overall, Biden’s visit had a slower pace than other foreign trips.
The 81-year-old president had no public events on his first day in Paris
after arriving on an overnight flight, and didn’t hold a press
conference with reporters, as is customary. John Kirby, a national
security spokesman, said that was necessary to prepare “in advance of
the weighty engagements” during subsequent days.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot on the calendar,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, it was a contrast to Macron’s tendency to offer prestigious
guests an intense schedule with a mix of official meetings, business
talks, cultural events and private dinners at fancy restaurants.</p>
<p>When the 46-year-old French leader hosted Chinese President Xi
Jinping last month, the two-day agenda was crammed with activities
including a trip to the Pyrenees Mountains near the border with Spain
where Macron spent time as a child.</p>

through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little

state pioneers program to turn inmates into wildland firefighters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Spokane, Washington — The inmates of Washington state’s prison system
tramp through the forest, their yellow uniforms and helmets bright
against the brown branches and green leaves.  </p>
<p>They are Arcadia 20, or ARC 20, an elite group of firefighters based
in Spokane who have been recruited from existing firefighting prison
camps.  </p>
<p>The aim? Teach the inmates the skills needed to help prevent forest
fires - and in the process, give them an opportunity to start on a path
to a new career.  </p>
<p>Recruited by the state’s Department of Natural Resources and
Department of Corrections, the program seeks to provide the dozen or so
inmates with enough training to prepare them for jobs as civilian
firefighters once they have completed their sentences.  </p>
<p>“I do believe one thing for sure, that people deserve a second
chance,” said Kenyatta Bridges, 34, who joined the ARC 20 team for
training in the middle of last year while serving a 10-year sentence for
manslaughter in a 2014 gang-affiliated shooting in Pasco, Washington.
 </p>
<p>Bridges started a job in a civilian fire crew on June 3, following
his release.  </p>
<p>Reuters was granted exclusive access to ARC 20 over three months,
including a visit last August to the Tonasket Rodeo Grounds, a rural
community in northeast Washington near the Canadian border. Bridges and
the ARC 20 crew were setting up their tents after a day of helping
contain a fire.</p>
<p>Crew members learn how to conduct prescribed burns, how to handle
dangerous equipment, and how to ensure fires that have been contained
stay that way. And when necessary, they are on the front lines of a
fire, digging lines to help reduce the chance a fire will continue to
spread.</p>
<p>“Team work, communications skills, an accountability for one’s
actions and others as it relates to duties and providing for safety” are
an integral part of their mindset, according to ARC 20 management.  </p>
<p>“The fellas that I’ve worked shoulder to shoulder with, they’re
amazing,” Bridges said. “We all made bad decisions in our life. Some of
us got caught, some of us didn’t. But we learn from our mistakes.”</p>
<p>Earning ability</p>
<p>While states across the American West have inmate firefighting crews,
Washington’s ARC 20 program is the only one of its kind in the U.S.,
recruiting incarcerated individuals from full confinement into a reentry
center where they continue to build skills in firefighting and prepare
for life after release.  </p>
<p>They also earn more. Inmates in Washington state’s regular prison
firefighting camps, who number around 230, are paid up to $1.50 per
hour, based on experience, for their daily duties. When dispatched to an
active fire zone, they are paid the state’s minimum wage of $16.28 per
hour plus overtime.  </p>
<p>Elite crew members who have joined the ARC 20 team are paid a base
salary of up to $3,796 per month with potential overtime pay on fire
assignments. This year-round crew has a maximum of 20 team members.
 </p>
<p>It had 13 people on the team during its first full year in 2023 and
expects to have 12 as Washington state’s fire season ramps up at the end
of June.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is struggling with the effects of climate
change, with higher-than-normal chances of wildfires and a longer season
this year, according to meteorologists at the Department of Natural
Resources, the state agency charged with wildfire prevention and
management.  </p>
<p>According to DNR officials who manage both fully incarcerated camp
crews and the ARC 20 team, a high-earning member of the camp crew
received approximately $11,000 in 2023, whereas an ARC 20 crew member
earned up to $60,000.  </p>
<p>The ARC 20 team is trained to join “hand crews” — teams of 18 to 25
firefighters who work and camp near the front lines of active wildfires,
often hiking long distances and carrying their own gear to reach remote
areas. They also conduct prescribed burns and chainsaw trees to the
ground as part of the state’s fire mitigation and forest management
efforts.</p>
<p>ARC 20’s crew superintendent Ben Hood is on the team that selects
participants.</p>
<p>“We call it getting bit with the fire bug… Once you get bit with it,
you’re hooked in,” said Hood. “It becomes part of, kind of who you are,
becomes more than just a job. It kind of becomes a lifestyle.”  </p>
<p>When the team isn’t traveling the state fighting fires, they are
housed at Brownstone Reentry Center, a minimum security facility in
downtown Spokane. Residents participate in work or training programs and
are granted additional freedoms like wearing normal clothes or owning a
cellphone.  </p>
<p>ARC 20 crew members are paid higher wages than some staff in the
state’s correctional system, including the facility where they live,
according to Brownstone’s manager.</p>
<p>Running a kitchen</p>
<p>Reuters visited another crew of fully incarcerated individuals in
September at a Department of Natural Resources facility at Cedar Creek
Corrections Center, southwest of the state’s capital city, Olympia.
 </p>
<p>They had just returned from a weeks-long assignment running a mobile
kitchen for almost 1,000 wildland firefighters per day, who were
fighting two of the 2023 season’s biggest fires in the state.  </p>
<p>Timothy Bullock, 32, an electrician jailed for second-degree assault
stemming from a domestic dispute, said he has changed his life goals and
wants to become a wildland firefighter.</p>
<p>“I used to drink quite a bit… it was a terrible mistake on my part
that affected other people, people I cared about. So it’s hard dealing
with that,” said Bullock, acknowledging a prison sentence may have been
needed for him to change his path. “I just know that I’m never going to
make those types of mistakes ever again.”  </p>
<p>Bullock has been a standout member of the Cedar Creek Corrections
Center camp crew, according to his bosses at DNR. He has submitted his
application for ARC 20 and is being considered for a spot in late
2024.</p>
<p>“I’m getting real close to getting out. It’s kind of working out for
the better, you know, to get back on my feet and then have an
opportunity when I get out,” said Bullock.</p>
<p>Washington’s model could be a ‘stepping stone’ for state agencies
across the U.S., according to transition crew liaison Roy Hardin, who
helped form the crew with Hood.  </p>
<p>“If a person is employed, has a really good job right when they get
out of prison, they’re not homeless, they’re probably not going to come
back,” said Hardin. He said four crew members from ARC 20 have gone on
to take jobs as members of the state firefighting agency – one engine
leader and three engine crew members.  </p>
<p>Kenyatta Bridges is one of those crew members.  </p>
<p>On June 3, he started fighting fires with DNR’s Arcadia Engine 7405
near Spokane, in one of the most wildfire prone areas of Washington
state.  </p>
<p>“He’s hard working. He’s motivated,” said superintendent Hood, who
recruited Bridges. “He’s becoming one of those leaders. He’s good with
the chainsaw. He doesn’t know how to quit working; he’s physically
capable of the job. He’s what you want in a firefighter.”</p>
<p>Bridges is elated for this new chapter of his life. Since his release
from Brownstone he has been living in transitional housing with other
formerly incarcerated individuals in Spokane, and on May 20 his partner
gave birth to their son.  </p>
<p>“I feel like I couldn’t ask for nothing better,” Bridges said,
discussing his life post-release. “To have everything so quickly, it
feels like every gear is rotating and spinning just on point.”</p>

<h2 id="some-us-families-opt-to-raise-teens-sans-social-media">Some US
families opt to raise teens sans social media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WESTPORT, Connecticut — Kate Bulkeley’s pledge to stay off social
media in high school worked at first. She watched the benefits pile up:
She was getting excellent grades. She read lots of books. The family had
lively conversations around the dinner table and gathered for movie
nights on weekends.</p>
<p>Then, as sophomore year got under way, the unexpected problems
surfaced. She missed a student government meeting arranged on Snapchat.
Her Model U.N. team communicates on social media, too, causing her
scheduling problems. Even the Bible Study club at her Connecticut high
school uses Instagram to communicate with members.</p>
<p>Gabriela Durham, a high school senior in Brooklyn, says navigating
high school without social media has made her who she is today. She is a
focused, organized, straight-A student. Not having social media has made
her an “outsider,” in some ways. That used to hurt; now, she says, it
feels like a badge of honor.</p>
<p>With the damaging consequences of social media increasingly well
documented, many parents are trying to raise their children with
restrictions or blanket bans. Teenagers themselves are aware that too
much social media is bad for them, and some are initiating social media
“cleanses” because of the toll it takes on mental health and grades.</p>
<p>This is a tale of two families, social media and the ever-present
challenge of navigating high school. It’s about what kids do when they
can’t extend their Snapstreaks or shut their bedroom doors and scroll
through TikToks past midnight. It’s about what families discuss when
they’re not having screen-time battles. It’s also about persistent
social ramifications.</p>
<p>The journeys of both families show the rewards and pitfalls of trying
to avoid social media in a world that is saturated by it.</p>
<p>Concerns about children and phone use are not new. But there is a
growing realization among experts that the COVID-19 pandemic
fundamentally changed the relationship kids have with social media. As
youth coped with isolation and spent excessive time online, the pandemic
effectively carved out a much larger space for social media in the lives
of American children.</p>
<p>Social media is where many kids turn to forge their emerging
identities, to seek advice, to unwind and relieve stress. In this era of
parental control apps and location tracking, social media is where this
generation is finding freedom.</p>
<p>It is also increasingly clear that the more time youth spend online,
the higher the risk of mental health problems.</p>
<p>Kids who use social media for more than three hours a day face double
the risk of depression and anxiety, according to studies cited by U.S.
Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who issued an extraordinary public warning
last spring about the risks of social media to young people.</p>
<p>The Bulkeleys and Gabriela’s mother, Elena Romero, both set strict
rules starting when their kids were young and still in elementary
school. They delayed giving phones until middle school and declared no
social media until 18. They educated the girls, and their younger
siblings, on the impact of social media on young brains, on online
privacy concerns, on the dangers of posting photos or comments that can
come back to haunt you.</p>
<p>At school, on the subway and at dance classes around New York City,
Gabriela is surrounded by reminders that social media is everywhere —
except on her phone.</p>
<p>Growing up without it has meant missing out on things. Everyone but
you gets the same jokes, practices the same TikTok dances, is up on the
latest viral trends. When Gabriela was younger, that felt isolating; at
times, it still does. But now, she sees not having social media as
freeing.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, as an outsider,” she says, “it seems like a lot
of kids use social media to promote a facade. And it’s really sad.”</p>
<p>There is also friend drama on social media and a lack of honesty,
humility and kindness that she feels lucky to be removed from.</p>
<p>Gabriela is a dance major at the Brooklyn High School of the Arts.
Senior year got intense with college and scholarship applications capped
by getting to perform at Broadway’s Shubert Theatre in March as part of
a city showcase of high school musicals.</p>
<p>“My kids’ schedules will make your head spin,” Romero says. On school
days, they’re up at 5:30 a.m. and out the door by 7. Romero drives the
girls to their three schools scattered around Brooklyn, then takes the
subway into Manhattan, where she teaches mass communications at the
Fashion Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>In New York City, it’s common for kids to get phones early in
elementary school, but Romero waited until each daughter reached middle
school and started taking public transportation home alone.</p>
<p>In the upscale suburb of Westport, Connecticut, the Bulkeleys have
faced questions about bending their rules. But not for the reason they
had anticipated.</p>
<p>Kate was perfectly content to not have social media. Her parents
figured at some point she might resist their ban because of peer
pressure or fear of missing out. But the 15-year-old sees it as a waste
of time. She describes herself as academic, introverted and focused on
building up extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>That’s why she needed Instagram.</p>
<p>“I needed it to be co-president of my Bible Study Club,” Kate
explains.</p>
<p>As Kate’s sophomore year started, she told her parents that she was
excited to be leading a variety of clubs but needed social media to do
her job. “It was the school that really drove the fact that we had to
reconsider our rule about no social media,” says Steph Bulkeley, Kate’s
mother.</p>
<p>Schools talk the talk about limiting screen time and the dangers of
social media, says her dad, Russ Bulkeley. But technology is rapidly
becoming part of the school day. Kate’s high school and their
13-year-old daughter Sutton’s middle school have cell phone bans that
aren’t enforced. Teachers will ask them to take out their phones to
photograph material during class time.</p>
<p>The Bulkeleys aren’t on board with that but feel powerless to change
it.</p>
<p>Ultimately they gave in to Kate’s plea for Instagram because they
trust her, and because she’s too busy to devote much time to social
media.</p>

id="netflixs-recipe-for-success-includes-secret-sauce-spiced-with-tech-savvy">Netflix’s
recipe for success includes ‘secret sauce’ spiced with tech savvy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS GATOS, California — Although its video streaming service sparkles
with a Hollywood sheen, Netflix still taps its roots in Silicon Valley
to stay a step ahead of traditional TV and movie studios.</p>
<p>The Los Gatos, California, company, based more than 300 miles away
from Hollywood, frequently reaches into its technological toolbox
without viewers even realizing it. It often just uses a few subtle
twists on the knobs of viewer recommendations to help keep its 270
million worldwide subscribers satisfied at a time when most of its
streaming rivals are seeing waves of cancelations from inflation-weary
subscribers.</p>
<p>Even when hit TV series like “The Crown” or “Bridgerton” have wide
appeal, Netflix still tries to cater to the divergent tastes of its vast
audience. One part of that recipe includes tailoring summaries and
trailers about its smorgasbord of shows to fit the personal interests of
each viewer.</p>
<p>So, someone who likes romance might see a plot summary or video
trailer for “The Crown” highlighting the relationship between Princess
Diana and Charles, while another viewer more into political intrigue may
be shown a clip of Queen Elizabeth in a meeting with Margaret
Thatcher.</p>
<p>For an Oscar-nominated film like “Nyad,” a lover of action might see
a trailer of the title character immersed in water during one of her
epic swims, while a comedy fan might see a lighthearted scene featuring
some amusing banter between the two stars, Annette Bening and Jodie
Foster.</p>
<p>Netflix is able to pull off these variations through the deep
understanding of viewing habits it gleans from crunching the data from
subscribers’ histories with its service — including those of customers
who signed up in the late 1990s when the company launched with a
DVD-by-mail service that continued to operate until last September.</p>
<p>“It is a secret sauce for us, no doubt,” Eunice Kim, Netflix’s chief
product officer, said while discussing the nuances of the ways Netflix
tries to reel different viewers into watching different shows. “The
North Star we have every day is keep people engaged, but also make sure
they are incredibly satisfied with their viewing experiences.”</p>
<p>As part of that effort, Netflix is rolling out a redesign of the home
page that greets subscribers when they are watching the streaming
service on a TV screen. The changes are meant to package all the
information that might appeal to a subscriber’s tastes in a more concise
format to reduce the “gymnastics with their eyes,” said Patrick
Flemming, Netflix’s senior director of member product.</p>
<p>What Netflix is doing with its previews may seem like a small thing,
but it can make a huge difference, especially as people looking to save
money start to limit the number of streaming services they have.</p>
<p>Last year, video streaming services collectively suffered about 140
million account cancelations, a 35% increase from 2022 and nearly triple
the volume in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic created a boom in demand
for entertainment from people corralled at home, according to numbers
compiled by the research firm Antenna.</p>
<p>Netflix doesn’t disclose its cancelation, or churn rate, but last
year its streaming service gained 30 million subscribers — marking its
second-biggest annual increase behind its own growth spurt during the
2020 pandemic lockdowns.</p>
<p>Part of last year’s subscription growth flowed from a crackdown on
viewers who had been freeloading off Netflix subscribers who shared
their account passwords. But the company is also benefiting from the
technological know-how that helps it to keep funneling shows to
customers who like them and make them think the service is worth the
money, according to J. Christopher Hamilton, an assistant professor of
television, radio and film at Syracuse University.</p>
<p>“What they have been doing is pretty ingenious and very, very
strategic,” Hamilton said. “They are definitely ahead of the legacy
media companies who are trying to do some of the same things but just
don’t have the level of sophistication, experience nor the history of
the data in their archives.”</p>
<p>Netflix’s nerdy heritage once was mocked by an entertainment industry
that looked down at the company’s geekdom.</p>
<p>Not long after that put-down, Netflix began mining its viewing data
to figure out how to produce a slate of original programming that would
attract more subscribers — an ambitious expansion that forced Time
Warner (now rolled into Warner Bros. Discovery) and other
long-established entertainment companies such as Walt Disney Co. into a
mad scramble to build their own streaming services.</p>
<p>Although those expansions initially attracted hordes of subscribers,
they also resulted in massive losses that have resulted in management
shakeups and drastic cutbacks, including the abrupt closure of a CNN
streaming service. </p>
<p>What Netflix is doing with technology to retain subscribers to boost
its fortunes — the company’s profit rose 20% to $5.4 billion last year —
now is widening the divide with rival services still trying to stanch
their losses.</p>
<p>Disney’s 4-year-old streaming service recently became profitable
after an overhaul engineered by CEO Bob Iger, but he thinks more work
will be required to catch up with Netflix.</p>
<p>Netflix isn’t going to help its rivals by divulging its secrets, but
the slicing and dicing generally starts with getting a grasp on which
viewers tend to gravitate to certain genres — the broad categories
include action, adventure, anime, fantasy, drama, horror, comedy,
romance and documentary — and then diving deeper from there.</p>
<p>In some instances, Netflix’s technology will even try to divine a
viewer’s mood at any given time by analyzing what titles are being
browsed or clicked on. In other instances, it’s relatively easy for the
technology to figure out how to make a film or TV series as appealing as
possible to specific viewers.</p>
<p>If Netflix’s data shows a subscriber has watched a lot of Hindi
productions, it would be almost a no-brainer to feature clips of
Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt in a role she played in the U.S. film,
“Heart of Stone” instead of the movie’s lead actress, Gal Gadot.</p>

<h2 id="lca-software-exit-the-matrix">LCA software: exit the matrix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life
cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a
product’s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each
stage on the environment (LCIA). There are a few pieces of LCA software
to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and
Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they’re expensive. But
there’s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.</p>
