id="chinas-state-media-support-protests-on-us-campuses-but-not-at-home">China’s
state media support protests on US campuses but not at home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — State media in China, where social protest is strongly
discouraged or punished, have been vocally supporting the
pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. campuses while decrying what they
describe as a heavy-handed crackdown on free speech by authorities.</p>
<p>“Can blindly using violence to suppress students be able to quell
domestic dissatisfaction with the government?” wrote Jun Zhengping
Studio, a social media account operated by the News Broadcasting Center
of the People’s Liberation Army, in an April 26 commentary.</p>
<p>“If American politicians really have a sense of democracy and human
rights, they should stop supporting Israel, stop endorsing Israel’s
actions, and do more things that are conducive to world peace.
Otherwise, the only one who will suffer backlash is the United States
itself.”</p>
<p>The People’s Daily, China’s state-owned newspaper, said in a video
that American students are protesting because they “can no longer stand
the double standards of the United States.”</p>
<p>On social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying echoed that comment and implied the
U.S. government was cracking down on protests at home while supporting
protests abroad.</p>
<p>She posted a clip of U.S. police arresting protesters with the
question, “Remember how U.S. officials reacted when these protests
happened elsewhere?”</p>
<p>The protests this month at scores of universities, including New
York’s Columbia University and George Washington University in the U.S.
capital, have opposed Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza over
the large number of civilian casualties. The student protesters are
demanding that their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel
and are calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the protests are a symbol
of American democracy, but he criticized the protesters for remaining
silent on the attack by Hamas militants in October that killed more
1,200 Israelis and sparked the conflict.</p>
<p>Critics say antisemitic rhetoric emerged at some of the protests, and
there have been clashes with police.</p>
<p>As of Monday, more than 900 students had been arrested, mainly for
trespassing because of protest camps they erected on university
property.</p>
<p>In an email to all faculty members and students, American University
stated that the school’s policy of supporting free speech has not
changed, but it explicitly prohibits “disruptive” behavior such as
setting up camps.</p>
<p>“Any demonstration that continues to interfere with university
operations or violate policies after engagement and de-escalation will
not be permitted, and those responsible will face conduct actions,
disciplinary sanctions, or arrest as appropriate,” the email said.</p>
<p>Reactions differ</p>
<p>The handling of the protests has been in stark contrast with the
Chinese authorities’ crackdown on domestic dissent and any form of
street protest.</p>
<p>China’s strict zero-COVID measures and censorship of critical voices
during the pandemic spurred street protests in many Chinese cities in
November 2022 that became known as the White Paper movement. Protesters
would hold up blank sheets of white paper to symbolize support for the
protests while not actually saying or doing anything, in hopes of not
getting into trouble.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Chinese police arrested and surveilled those caught
holding up white paper. Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye accused
“external anti-China forces” of being behind the protests and called
them a “color revolution.”</p>
<p>Critics were quick to point out Beijing’s double standard when
Chinese state media backed U.S. college protesters.</p>
<p>Sean Haines, a British man who worked for Chinese state media from
2016 to 2019, told VOA that Chinese state media’s extensive coverage of
Western demonstrations is a consistent policy.</p>
<p>“At Xinhua, when we chose the running order for news, foreign
protests were always promoted,” he said, “especially if it was around
election times. ‘Look how scary foreign democracies are, aren’t you glad
China doesn’t have this?’”</p>
<p>He said footage of protests is easy to find in places with a free
press, such as the United States and the West, while there are almost no
images of protests in China, a one-party authoritarian state where
public demonstrations are quickly stopped.</p>
<p>“It’s ironic.” he said. “China is using [the] West’s free speech,
openness, right to protest — against itself.”</p>
<p>Although Chinese authorities have not declared support for any side
in the Israel-Hamas war, they were reluctant to condemn the militants’
October attack and repeatedly blamed Israel and the U.S. for the
conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>At the same time, antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiments, including
conspiracy theories, have been allowed on China’s highly censored social
media.</p>
<p>A popular claim is that U.S. support for Israel is not because of
history and democratic values but because a Jewish cabal secretly
controls U.S. politics and business.</p>
<p>Hu Xijin, a special commentator and former editor-in-chief of China’s
state-run Global Times, posted on social media site Weibo on April 19
that all walks of life in the U.S. “cannot suppress the protests of
college students everywhere, which shows that the Jewish political and
business alliance’s control over American public opinion has
declined.”</p>
<p>Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.</p>

their peers want alternatives, some young voters endorse Biden or
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A majority of younger voters in this U.S. presidential election say
they wish they had someone other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump to
choose from. Some of that has to do with the candidates’ ages. But who
are the younger voters backing one of the two? VOA Correspondent Scott
Stearns reports.</p>

<h2 id="teslas-identity-crisis-gets-hardcore">Tesla’s Identity Crisis
Gets Hardcore</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Chaos at Tesla is nothing new. But the company now appears to be going
through something of an identity crisis, with its future at war with its
past.
</p>
<p>
Let’s just recap the past few weeks: First, Tesla released first-quarter
delivery numbers that came up
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-rivian-q1-deliveries" target="_blank">well
short</a> of even analysts’ most cynical predictions, followed by
first-quarter earnings that were, in a word,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-q1-2024-earnings" target="_self"><u>poor</u></a>.
In between those two events, <em>Reuters</em> reported that Tesla had
canceled a long-promised sub-$30,000 electric vehicle (a report CEO Elon
Musk denied …
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1776272471324606778" target="_blank">sorta</a>),
and the company
<a href="https://heatmap.news/tesla-layoffs-appliance-week" target="_blank">laid
off</a> more than 10% of its workforce.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to today and reports of
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart" target="_blank">further
layoffs</a> at Tesla, this time in the company’s Supercharging division.
To just about everyone who follows the company, this was shocking news.
Tesla’s Supercharging network isn’t just a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-ford-supercharger-network" target="_blank">competitive
advantage</a>, it’s the de facto national standard for EVs in the United
States. Major automakers —
<a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/05/25/ford-ev-customers-to-gain-access-to-12-000-tesla-superchargers--.html" target="_blank"><u>Ford</u></a>,<a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-adopts-the-north-american-charging-standard-to-expand-customer-charging-options/" target="_blank"><u>
Toyota</u></a>,<a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0608-gm.html" target="_blank"><u>
General Motors</u></a> — and EV startups like Rivian have signed deals
with Tesla to use its charger design, known as the North American
Charging Standard and designed their new vehicles
(<a href="https://twitter.com/Rivian/status/1769758297438159021" target="_blank"><u>or
sent adapters</u></a>) so their drivers can access the network.
</p>
<p>
The Supercharging network was<strong>, </strong>however, consistent with
what might now be called the “old” model of Tesla — a company that tried
to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy,” as the
company’s mission statement put it, by getting as many electric cars
(ideally, but not solely, its own) on the road as possible. But that
model seems to be on its way out. As Musk told investors on the earnings
call, Tesla should be thought of “thought of as an AI or robotics
company” — not, anymore, as merely a car company.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Those Supercharging partnerships weren’t an act of charity.
BloombergNEF, Bloomberg’s in-house energy research group, estimated that
Tesla’s charging business
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-09/tesla-tsla-charging-network-has-become-a-serious-business" target="_blank"><u>could
generate three-quarters of a billion dollars of profits by 2030</u></a>.
While it doesn’t seem like Tesla is going to rip the Superchargers from
the ground, a now-former Tesla employee
<a href="https://twitter.com/willjameson/status/1785321812383113251" target="_blank">said
on X that</a> “further improvements to standards and engagements across
the industry will suffer.” Already the company has
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/30/tesla-pulling-back-supercharger-plans-firing-team/" target="_blank">pulled
out</a> of four planned new Supercharger locations in New York,
according to <em>Electrek</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower
pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of
existing locations,” Musk
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1785406795814510785" target="_blank">tweeted</a>
(after the market close) Tuesday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
If the future of the growth of the Supercharging network is in doubt,
Tesla’s expansion of its self-driving efforts (which are still well
short of rivals like Waymo’s) is full steam ahead. Close Tesla-watchers
have speculated that the future of Tesla’s charging infrastructure will
change as the company advances further towards truly autonomous driving
and its much-heralded “robotaxi,” which Musk has promised to reveal by
August 8. All of this seems to have pleased investors, who responded to
the announcement by sending Tesla shares up 10% in aftermarket trading.
That share price jumped again Monday, after news that Musk had
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-29/tesla-clears-key-china-fsd-hurdle-with-baidu-mapping-deal" target="_blank">paved
the way</a> for Full Self-Driving to be deployed in China.
</p>
<p>
One would think that reports of Tesla further tightening its focus on
artificial intelligence and automation would have delighted these
investors. The company’s burned some $2.5 billion of cash in the first
quarter thanks to both its extravagant spending on developing its AI
capabilities and the fact that it made too many cars for what turned out
to be a soft electric vehicle market. “Hopefully these actions are
making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount
and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in an email to staff about the
Supercharging layoffs, according to <em>The Information</em>. “While
some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing
so.” And yet shares were down 5.5% by the time the market closed on
Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
The investment community can’t seem to decide whether it wants Tesla to
be the type of company that will devote its resources to a mass market
car or throw them at a much more exciting — though by no means assured —
autonomous driving play.
</p>
<p>
In its earnings presentation, Tesla said that new models were coming,
but not on a whole new platform, which meant that there would less
capital expenditure for a new production line. For some analysts, it was
all they needed to hear, Morningstar’s Seth Goldstein wrote a note
titled “Our Long-Term Growth Thesis Is Confirmed as Affordable Vehicle
Still in Development.”
</p>
<p>
And some in the the analyst community were also jazzed by Musk’s China
jaunt. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, hailed the
trip, writing “whether Tesla’s CEO is sleeping on a floor or on a plane
… the message is clear: he’s back.” Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities,
another Tesla optimist, said approval for FSD in China was “a watershed
moment for the Tesla story.” As recently as Tuesday morning,
<em>Axios</em> cautiously
<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-generate-1b872610-0635-11ef-9e18-652cbf4c7d1e.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&stream=top" target="_blank">declared</a>
that the company “may be steadily regaining investor confidence after a
rough patch.”
</p>
<p>
Tesla is also working on wireless charging, as was confirmed last year
in a video hosted by, of all people, Jay Leno. Tesla’s design chief,
Franz von Holzhausen,
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/701458/tesla-confirms-its-working-on-wireless-inductive-ev-charger/" target="_blank">told
Leno</a> that “we are working on inductive charging. You don’t even need
to plug anything in at that point. You just drive over the pad in your
garage and you start charging.” It’s obvious why this type of charging
would be more conducive to autonomous driving than the company’s exist
Superchargers, as all they would require is driving over
them.<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Even the multiple rounds of deep layoffs are a sign to some Tesla
optimists that Musk’s attention is now fully devoted to the company.
When asked by an analyst on the earnings call to “talk about where your
heart is at in terms of your interests,” Musk said that Tesla
“constitutes a majority of my work time,” adding: I’m going to make sure
Tesla is quite prosperous.” <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
If investors are sending mixed messages, Musk, certainly, has made his
preference clear. Tesla will become a autonomous driving company or die
trying — at least until he changes his mind again.

<p>Humans speak countless different languages. Not only are these
languages incompatible, but runtime transpilation is a real pain. Sadly,
every standardisation initiative has failed. At least there is someone
to blame for this state-of-affairs: God. It was him, after-all, who
cursed humanity to speak different languages, in an early dispute over a
controversial property development. However, mankind can only blame
itself for the fact that computers struggle to talk to each other. And
one of the biggest problems is the most simple: computers do not agree
on how to write letters in binary. ↫ Cal Paterson For most users,
character encoding issues are not something they have to deal with.
Programmers and other people who deal with the lower levels of
computing, however, deal with this way more often than they should.</p>

<p>Amman, Jordan — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to

that there are “no more excuses” and “the time to act is now.”</p>
<p>“Our focus right now is on getting a cease-fire and hostages home.
That is the most urgent thing, and it’s also I think what is achievable
because the Israelis have put a strong proposal on the table. They’ve
demonstrated that they’re willing to compromise, and now it’s on Hamas,”
Blinken told reporters as he wrapped up a visit to Jordan.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of getting more humanitarian
assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>“This has been part of our work every single day. It’s also been the
focus of every single one of my trips to the region,” Blinken said,
adding that he will discuss the issue when he holds meetings in Israel
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier, the top U.S. diplomat held separate talks with Jordanian
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and King Abdullah II before meeting with
Sigrid Kaag, U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for
Gaza.</p>
<p>Blinken thanked Abdullah for Jordan’s leadership in facilitating the
delivery of humanitarian aid, including joint U.S.-Jordan airdrops that
to date have delivered over 1,000 tons of humanitarian assistance to
Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed joint efforts to expedite the flow of
additional urgently needed aid to Gaza from Jordan through land routes.
Blinken also commended the king’s commitment to economic modernization
and vital public sector reforms.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, Blinken met with Palestinians from Gaza at the
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs before meeting with
Kaag. Blinken told Kaag he was anxious to hear directly from her,
adding, “The entire team is doing extraordinary work to ensure that
people in Gaza get the help and support and the assistance they
need.”</p>
<p>Israel declared war on Hamas after its October 7 attack on Israel
that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250
hostages.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 people,
according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, a figure that Israel says
includes several thousand Hamas fighters.</p>
<p>A delegation from Hamas participated in talks Monday in Egypt, which
with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli
offensive and see hostages freed.</p>
<p>U.S., Saudi talks</p>
<p>In Riyadh earlier this week Blinken said the United States is close
to finishing a security agreement with Saudi Arabia that would be
offered if the country makes peace with Israel.</p>
<p>“The work that Saudi Arabia, the United States have been doing
together in terms of our own agreements, I think, is potentially very
close to completion,” Blinken told an audience at the World Economic
Forum on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the two nations have done intensive work over the last month
on Israeli-Saudi normalization.</p>
<p>Blinken disclosed that he was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia and
Israel on October 10 last year to focus specifically on the Palestinian
part of the normalization deal because that is an essential component.
But it did not happen because of the Hamas terror attack on Israel.</p>
<p>“In order to move forward with normalization, two things will be
required: calm in Gaza and a credible pathway to a Palestinian state,”
Blinken said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said creating a pathway to a Palestinian state
with security guarantees for Israel is key to lasting peace and security
in the Middle East and to Israel’s integration in the region.</p>
<p>The Saudis have demanded, as a prerequisite, to see an Israeli
commitment to the two-state solution.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the two-state
solution and the return of the Palestinian Authority to control Gaza,
demands that are widely supported by the international community.</p>
<p>Nimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Middle East
Institute, told VOA in an email, “Saudi Arabia has been gradually
opening towards Israel for a decade. Significant progress was made in
the months prior to the Hamas attack of October 7, with the hope of
linking an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement to a pre-presidential
election, U.S.-Saudi defense pact. The war stalled the process, but
talks are continuing and are at a decisive phase.”</p>
<p>If Netanyahu’s opposition to the two-state solution remains
unchanged, Goren said, he might struggle to secure normalization with
Saudi Arabia.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-facts-about-posix">A few facts about POSIX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over 35 years ago, these problems with software portability led to
the emergence of the first POSIX standard in 1988. The acronym was
coined by Richard Stallman, who added “X” to the end of Portable
Operating System Interface. It’s meant to provide a specification of the
interface that different Unix operating systems should have in common,
including programming languages and tools. It’s important to note that
the interface is portable, and not the implementation. ↫ vorakl While
POSIX certainly isn’t perfect, and support for it in various operating
systems claiming to support POSIX even less so, there’s no denying its
success. Even if the dream of 100% source code portability isn’t
possible under POSIX for applications that are a little more complex
than basic CLI tools, there’s enough portability that platforms like
Linux, the various BSDs, macOS, and others, can share quite a bit of
code. One of my favourite things about POSIX is that it shows up in the
most unexpected of places. Windows, for instance, has had various
options for POSIX compatibility, some of which straight from Microsoft
itself, like the currently well-known Windows Subsystem for Linux, but
also mostly forgotten options like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that
shipped with Windows NT until Windows 2000, or the very rudimentary
POSIX compatibility in the Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets
API. OS/2 had POSIX compatibility as well, through EMX (Eberhard Mattes
eXtender). It gave OS/2 – and MS-DOS – a POSIX API, and even provided
access to native OS/2 APIs as well, and could run 32bit applications.
You’d be surprised by how many more operating systems offered forms of
POSIX compatibility, either out of the box or through first or third
party add-ons.</p>

in Android just got a big setback</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Although Google has shown significant progress in recent weeks in
improving RISC-V support in Android, it seems that we’re still quite a
bit away from seeing RISC-V hardware running certified builds of
Android. Earlier today, a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google who,
according to their LinkedIn, leads the Android Systems Team and works on
Android’s Linux kernel fork, submitted a series of patches to AOSP that
“remove ACK’s support for riscv64.” The description of these patches
states that “support for risc64 GKI kernels is discontinued.” ↫ Mishaal
Rahman Google provided Android Authority with a statement, claiming that
Android will continue to support RISC-V. What these patches do, however,
is remove support for the architecture from the Generic Kernel Image,
which is the only type of kernel Google certifies for Android, which
means that it is now no longer possible to ship a certified Android
device that uses RISC-V. Any OEM shipping a RISC-V Android device will
have to create and maintain its own kernel fork with the required
patches. This doesn’t seem to align with Google’s statement. So, unless
Google intends to add RISC-V support back into GKI, there won’t be any
officially certified Android devices running on RISC-V. Definitely an
odd chain of events here.</p>

id="democrats-say-they-will-save-speaker-mike-johnsons-job-if-republicans-try-to-oust-him">Democrats
say they will save Speaker Mike Johnson’s job if Republicans try to oust
him</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Democrats will vote to save Republican Speaker
Mike Johnson’s job should some of his fellow GOP lawmakers seek to
remove him from the position, Democratic leaders said Tuesday, avoiding
a repeat of when eight Republicans joined with Democrats to oust his
predecessor, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p>Johnson, R-La., has come under heavy criticism from some Republicans
for moving forward with aid for Ukraine as part of a $95 billion
emergency spending package that passed this month. It would take only a
handful of Republicans to remove Johnson from the speakership if the
Democratic caucus went along with the effort.</p>
<p>But Democratic leaders took that possibility off the table.</p>
<p>“At this moment, upon completion of our national security work, the
time has come to turn the page on this chapter of Pro-Putin Republican
obstruction,” said a statement from the top three House Democrats, Reps.
Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar. “We will vote to
table Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Motion to Vacate the Chair. If she
invokes the motion, it will not succeed.”</p>
<p>Greene, R-Ga., earlier this month filed a resolution with the House
clerk — called a motion to vacate — that would remove Johnson from
office if approved by the House. And while Greene did not force the
resolution to be taken up immediately, she told reporters she was laying
the groundwork for future consideration. She had two co-sponsors, Reps.
Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.</p>
<p>Johnson was quick to distance himself from Democrats on the issue,
saying he had no conversations with Jeffries or anyone else about saving
his job.</p>
<p>“I was laser-focused on getting the supplemental done,” Johnson said,
referring to the aid package. “I’ve had colleagues from both parties
come up to me on the floor, of course, and say we won’t stand for this.
… I’ve not requested assistance from anyone. I’m not focused on that at
all.”</p>
<p>Many House Republicans are eager to move past the divisions that have
tormented their ranks ever since taking the majority last January. At a
closed-door session Tuesday morning, much of the discussion focused on
how to create unity in the party heading into the November
elections.</p>
<p>Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., said Republicans heard from Michael Whatley,
the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, who emphasized
that Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, wants to
unify the majority in the House. He said that’s a message that certainly
helps Johnson.</p>
<p>“What he wants is a unified Republican majority, so my message is
singing from the same song sheet as President Trump,” Barr said.</p>
<p>Still, Greene indicated she may still move forward with the effort to
remove Johnson, tweeting on X that she believes in recorded votes to put
“Congress on record.” She also called Johnson “officially the Democratic
Speaker of the House” and questioned “what slimy deal” he made for
Democratic support.</p>
<p>“Americans deserve to see the Uniparty on full display. I’m about to
give them their coming out party!” Greene tweeted. “Uniparty” is a
derisive term some Republicans use to describe cooperation between some
fellow Republicans and Democrats.</p>

Scammers stole more than $3.4 billion from older Americans last
year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Scammers stole more than $3.4 billion from older
Americans last year, according to an FBI report released Tuesday that
shows a rise in losses through increasingly sophisticated criminal
tactics to trick the vulnerable into giving up their life savings.</p>
<p>Losses from scams reported by Americans over the age of 60 last year
were up 11% over the year before, according to the FBI’s report.
Investigators are warning of a rise in brazen schemes to drain bank
accounts that involve sending couriers in person to collect cash or gold
from victims.</p>
<p>“It can be a devastating impact to older Americans who lack the
ability to go out and make money,” said Deputy Assistant Director James
Barnacle of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “People lose all
their money. Some people become destitute.”</p>
<p>The FBI received more than 100,000 complaints by victims of scams
over the age of 60 last year, with nearly 6,000 people losing more than
$100,000. It follows a sharp rise in reported losses by older Americans
in the two years after the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, when people were
stuck at home and easier for scammers to reach over the phone.</p>
<p>Barnacle said investigators are seeing organized, transnational
criminal enterprises targeting older Americans through a variety of
schemes, like romance scams and investment frauds.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported fraud among older adults last year was
tech support scams, in which criminals pose over the phone as technical
or customer service representatives. In one such scam authorities say is
rising in popularity, criminals impersonate technology, banking and
government officials to convince victims that foreign hackers have
infiltrated their bank accounts and instruct them that to protect their
money they should move it to a new account — one secretly controlled by
the scammers.</p>
<p>Federal investigators saw an uptick between May and December of
scammers using live couriers to take money from victims duped into
believing their accounts had been compromised, according to the FBI. In
those cases, scammers tell victims that their bank accounts have been
hacked and that they need to liquidate their assets into cash or buy
gold or other precious metals to protect their funds. Then the
fraudsters arrange for a courier to pick it up in person.</p>
<p>“A lot of the the fraud schemes are asking victims to send money via
a wire transfer, or a cryptocurrency transfer. When the victim is
reluctant to do that, they’re given an alternative,” Barnacle said. “And
so the bad guy will use courier services.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, an 81-year-old Ohio man fatally shot an Uber
driver he thought was trying to rob him after receiving scam phone
calls, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The man had been receiving calls from someone pretending to be an
officer from the local court who demanded money. The Uber driver had
been told to retrieve a package from the man’s home, a request
authorities say was possibly made by the same scam caller or an
accomplice.</p>
<p>The staggering losses to older Americans are likely an undercount.
Only about half of the more than 880,000 complaints reported to the
FBI’s Internet Crime Compliance Center last year included information on
the age of the victim.</p>

consumer confidence at lowest level since 2022</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. consumers appear less optimistic about the jobs
market and more worried about future financial conditions, bringing a
closely watched confidence metric to its lowest level since July 2022, a
survey showed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The consumer confidence index fell to 97.0 in April, said The
Conference Board, significantly below the 104.0 reading that analysts
anticipated.</p>
<p>This marks the third straight month consumer confidence has worsened,
the report said, and comes as President Joe Biden struggles to boost
perceptions about the economy as his reelection campaign ramps up.</p>
<p>“Consumers became less positive about the current labor market
situation, and more concerned about future business conditions, job
availability, and income,” said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The
Conference Board.</p>
<p>But she added that despite the slip, “optimism about the present
situation continues to more than offset concerns about the future.”</p>
<p>The biggest worries surrounded “elevated price levels, especially for
food and gas,” said Peterson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, politics and global conflicts were “distant runners-up,”
she added.</p>
<p>While consumers rated current business conditions “positively,” their
views of the labor market weakened with more reporting that jobs are
hard to get, said The Conference Board.</p>
<p>Consumers also became less upbeat about their families’ financial
situations, both currently and in the future.</p>
<p>“Perceptions about the labor market deteriorated even as job growth
remains robust, and the unemployment rate is historically low,” noted
Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p>“A deteriorating trend in sentiment could persist,” she
cautioned.</p>
<p>This risks bogging down spending and growth, given that inflation
remains persistent and interest rate cuts are “not imminent,” she
said.</p>

id="florida-democrats-hope-abortion-marijuana-issues-draw-young-voters">Florida
Democrats hope abortion, marijuana issues draw young voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Jordan Vassallo is lukewarm about casting
her first presidential ballot for President Joe Biden in November. But
when the 18-year-old senior at Jupiter High School in Florida thinks
about the things she cares about, she says her vote for the Democratic
incumbent is an “obvious choice.”</p>
<p>Vassallo will be voting for a constitutional ballot amendment that
would prevent the state of Florida from prohibiting abortion before a
fetus can survive on its own — essentially the standard that existed
nationally before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the constitutional
protections to abortion and left the matter for states to decide.</p>
<p>Passage of the amendment would wipe away Florida’s six-week abortion
law, which Vassallo says makes no sense.</p>
<p>“Most people don’t know they are pregnant at six weeks,” she
said.</p>
<p>Biden, despite her reticence, will get her vote as well.</p>
<p>In Florida and across the United States, voters in Vassallo’s age
group could prove pivotal in the 2024 election, from the presidency to
ballot amendments and down-ballot races that will determine who controls
Congress. She is likely to be among more than 8 million new voters
eligible to vote this November since the 2022 elections, according to
Tufts University Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning
and Engagement.</p>
<p>While some of those voters share Vassallo’s priorities of gun
violence prevention and abortion rights, recent protests on college
campuses about the war between Israel and Hamas, including at some
Florida campuses, have thrown a new element of uncertainty into the mix.
In Florida and elsewhere, observers across the political spectrum are
looking on with intense interest.</p>
<p>Florida Democrats hope young voters will be driven to the polls by
ballot amendments legalizing marijuana and enshrining abortion rights.
They hope the more tolerant views of young voters on those issues will
reverse an active voter registration edge of nearly 900,000 for
Republicans in Florida, which has turned from the ultimate swing state
in 2000 to reliably Republican in recent years.</p>
<p>According to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the electorate,
about 8 in 10 Florida voters under age 45 in the 2022 midterm elections
said the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade had an impact on
their decision to vote and who to support. The youngest voters, under
age 30, appeared more likely than others to say the decision was the
single most important factor in their votes, with about 3 in 10 saying
that, compared with about 2 in 10 older voters.</p>
<p>Nathan Mitchell, president of Florida Atlantic University’s College
Republicans, questions how impactful abortion will be in the
election.</p>
<p>According to AP VoteCast, relatively few Florida voters in the 2022
midterms believed abortion should be either completely banned or fully
permitted in all cases. Even among Republicans, just 12% said abortion
should be illegal in all cases. About half of Republicans said it should
be banned in most cases.</p>
<p>Voters under 45 were slightly more likely than others to say abortion
should always be legal, with 30% taking that position.</p>
<p>Mitchell said while abortion is a strong issue, especially for women,
he doesn’t think it will drive many younger voters to the polls.</p>
<p>“I think other amendments will probably do that, especially the
recreational marijuana amendment,” Mitchell said. “I think that’s going
to bring out a lot more voters than abortion will.”</p>
<p>The AP VoteCast survey lends some credence to his thinking. About 6
in 10 Florida voters in the 2022 elections favored legalizing the
recreational use of marijuana nationwide, the survey found. Among voters
under 45, that was 76%. Still, it’s unclear how important that issue is
for younger voters compared with other issues.</p>
<p>The big question is whether other issues can override Biden’s
enthusiasm problem among young Florida voters and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Six in 10 adults under 30 nationally said in a December AP-NORC
Center for Public Affairs Research poll that they would be dissatisfied
with Biden as the Democratic Party nominee in 2024. About 2 in 10 said
in a March poll that “excited” would describe their emotions if Biden
were reelected.</p>
<p>Young voters were crucial to the broad and racially diverse coalition
that helped elect Biden in 2020. About 6 in 10 voters under 30 backed
Biden nationally, according to AP VoteCas. A Pew Research Center survey
showed that those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular voters in
that election.</p>
<p>In Florida, Biden won 64% of young voters — similar to his national
numbers.</p>
<p>New issues that concern young voters have emerged this year. Biden’s
handling of the Israel-Hamas war has sparked protests at college
campuses across the country, and Biden’s inability to deliver
broad-based student loan forgiveness affects many young voters directly.
Concern about climate change also continues to grow. AP-NORC data from
February shows that majorities of Americans under 30 disapprove of how
Biden is handling a range of issues, including the conflict between the
Israelis and Palestinians, immigration, the economy, climate change and
abortion policy.</p>
<p>But in Florida, it will be abortion rights and marijuana that give
voters actual control over issues beyond a presidential rematch most did
not want but got anyway, said Trevian Briskey, a 21-year-old FAU
student.</p>
<p>Tony Figueroa, president of Miami Young Republicans, said the
abortion issue is important to many young voters, regardless of where
they stand. He noted, however, that Florida “is a very conservative
state.” That means some of the young voters motivated by the issue favor
stricter abortion laws.</p>
<p>“Given how Florida has become so much more red over the past couple
of years, really it’s more of a way to galvanize or mobilize young
voters where this is an important issue for them,” Figueroa said. “It’s
really a way to get them to come out in droves.”</p>
<p>Matheus Xavier, 21, who studies biology at Florida Atlantic
University, said he considered voting for Trump at some point, but
changed his mind since Biden fell more in line with the things he cares
about, including the preservation of abortion rights.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, you got to go with what you support,” he
said. “I guess Biden kind of shows more of that. If there was another
option that was actually good, I’d probably go for that.”</p>

Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>, adding that “it takes 4.5 years on average
to finish an environmental-impact statement.” Through the new Bipartisan
Permitting Reform Implementation Rule, Biden seeks to make the process
more efficient by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
setting one- and two-year deadlines by which agencies must complete
environmental reviews
</li>
<li>
introducing page limits for the reviews
</li>
<li>
creating a unified federal review process
</li>
<li>
establishing one lead agency for handling reviews
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The new rule says federal agencies must consider a project’s impacts on
climate change, as well as environmental justice. It also reverses a
2020 overhaul carried out by former President Trump that the Biden
administration called “legally questionable.” Brenda Mallory, chair of
the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the changes “will
help speed infrastructure and permitting, but without losing sight of
the environmental and health benefits we need to protect.”

<p>In December 2020, when the pandemic illustrated the extraordinary
disadvantage created by the inability of those in low-income households
to communicate online with schools and medical professionals,
then-president Trump signed into law an emergency program to provide
funding to make internet access affordable. In 2021, Congress turned
that idea into the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and made it
part of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (also
known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).</p>

Stones show no signs of slowing down as they begin their latest
tour</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>houston — Time marches on and all good things must come to an end.
But don’t tell that to The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>What many believe to be the greatest rock ‘n’ roll band in the world
showed no signs of slowing down anytime soon as they kicked off their
latest tour Sunday night at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>The Stones have been touring for more than 60 years. Frontman Mick
Jagger and lead guitarist Keith Richards are both 80, with guitarist
Ronnie Wood not far behind at 76. Their tour is being sponsored in part
by AARP.</p>
<p>But during a vibrant two-hour show, the Stones played with the energy
of a band that was on tour for the first time.</p>
<p>“It’s great to be back in the Lone Star State,” Jagger told the
packed stadium, filled with longtime fans, many wearing faded concert
shirts from previous tours.</p>
<p>Jagger often strutted up and down the stage with seemingly boundless
energy while Richards and Wood played many familiar guitar riffs beloved
by fans. Jagger often led the audience in sing-alongs.</p>
<p>“The energy level is up and it’s always up with them. The age doesn’t
show,” Dale Skjerseth, the Stones’ production director, said Friday
before the concert.</p>
<p>The Stones have hit the road to support the release of their latest
album, “Hackney Diamonds,” the band’s first record of original music
since 2005.</p>
<p>Houston was the first stop on the band’s 16-city tour across the U.S.
and Canada. Other cities on the tour include New Orleans, Philadelphia
and Vancouver, British Columbia. The tour ends on July 17 in Santa
Clara, California.</p>
<p>During Sunday’s 18-song concert set list, the Stones played several
tracks off the new record, including the lead single, “Angry.” They also
played classics including “Sympathy for the Devil,” “Gimme Shelter,”
“Honky Tonk Women” and “Start Me Up.”</p>
<p>After playing “Beast of Burden,” Jagger said that concertgoers in
Houston had voted to include it on the set list.</p>
<p>“You can’t go wrong with that,” one man in the audience could be
heard screaming.</p>
<p>The Stones also played some unexpected choices, including “Rocks
Off,” from their 1972 double album “Exile on Main St.” and “Out of
Time,” a 1966 song that Jagger said during the concert had not ever been
played by the band in the U.S.</p>
<p>With the 2021 death of drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones are now
comprised of the core trio of Jagger, Richards and Wood. On Sunday, they
were backed by various musicians including two keyboardists, a new
drummer, backup singers and a brass section.</p>
<p>While the stage was surrounded by a large collection of video screens
projecting images throughout the show, the main focus of the concert was
the band and their songs.</p>
<p>Before Sunday’s concert, Jagger spent time on Friday touring NASA’s
Johnson Space Center in suburban Houston, posting photos on his
Instagram account of him with astronauts inside Mission Control.</p>
<p>“I had an amazing trip to the space center,” Jagger said.</p>
<p>When asked if the band might be thinking about retiring, Skjerseth
said he doubts that will happen.</p>
<p>“This is not the end. They’re very enthused,” he said.</p>

suspends pro-Palestinian protesters after encampment talks stall</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Columbia University on Monday began suspending
pro-Palestinian activists who refused to dismantle a tent encampment on
its New York City campus after the Ivy League school declared a
stalemate in talks seeking to end the polarizing protest.</p>
<p>University President Nemat Minouche Shafik said in a statement that
days of negotiations between student organizers and academic leaders had
failed to persuade demonstrators to remove the dozens of tents set up to
express opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The crackdown at Columbia, at the center of Gaza-related protests
roiling university campuses across the U.S. in recent weeks, came as
police at the University of Texas at Austin arrested dozens of students
whom they doused with pepper spray at a pro-Palestinian rally.</p>
<p>Columbia sent a letter on Monday morning warning that students who
did not vacate the encampment by 2 p.m. ET and sign a form promising to
abide by university policies would face suspension and become ineligible
to complete the semester in good standing.</p>
<p>“We have begun suspending students as part of this next phase of our
efforts to ensure safety on our campus,” said Ben Chang, a university
spokesperson, at a briefing on Monday evening.</p>
<p>“The encampment has created an unwelcoming environment for many of
our Jewish students and faculty and a noisy distraction that interferes
with the teaching, learning and preparing for final exams,” Chang
said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Shafik said Columbia would not divest from finances in
Israel, a key demand of the protesters. Instead, she offered to invest
in health and education in Gaza and make Columbia’s direct investment
holdings more transparent.</p>
<p>Protesters have vowed to keep their encampment on the Manhattan
campus until Columbia meets three demands: divestment, transparency in
university finances, and amnesty for students and faculty disciplined
for their part in the protests.</p>
<p>“These repulsive scare tactics mean nothing compared to the deaths of
over 34,000 Palestinians. We will not move until Columbia meets our
demands or we are moved by force,” leaders of the Columbia Student
Apartheid Divest coalition said in a statement read at a news conference
following the deadline.</p>
<p>Hundreds of demonstrators, many wearing traditional Palestinian
keffiyeh scarves, marched in circles around the exterior of the
encampment chanting, “Disclose! Divest! We will not stop, we will not
rest.”</p>
<p>Shafik faced an outcry from many students, faculty and outside
observers for summoning New York City police two weeks ago to dismantle
the encampment.</p>
<p>After more than 100 arrests were made, students restored the
encampment on a hedge-lined lawn of the university grounds within days
of the April 18 police action.</p>
<p>Since then, students at dozens of campuses from California to New
England have set up similar encampments to demonstrate their anger over
the Israeli operation in Gaza and the perceived complicity of their
schools in it.</p>
<p>The pro-Palestinian rallies have sparked intense campus debate over
where school officials should draw the line between freedom of
expression and hate speech</p>
<p>Students protesting Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, including
some Jewish peace activists, have said they are being censured as
antisemitic merely for criticizing the Israeli government or for
expressing support for Palestinian rights.</p>
<p>“The movement itself is not antisemitic,” said Nicholas Fink, a
freshman history major at Columbia who has not participated in the
protests.</p>
<p>He is among a few dozen Jewish students who met privately with U.S.
House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson during a campus visit by
Republican members of Congress last week. Johnson and other
congressional Republicans have claimed that Columbia and other
universities have turned a blind eye to antisemitic hostility and
harassment on campus.</p>
<p>Some Jewish groups argue that anti-Israel rhetoric frequently delves
into or feeds overt forms of anti-Jewish hatred and calls for violence,
and thus should not be tolerated</p>
<p>Student protests abound</p>
<p>At the University of California, Los Angeles, where opposing sides
clashed over the weekend, pro-Israeli activists set up a large screen
and loudspeakers to play a tape loop of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by
Hamas militants. The video appears aimed at countering pro-Hamas chants
that seeped into campus protests in support of Palestinian civilians
besieged in Gaza.</p>
<p>UCLA also stepped-up security around a pro-Palestinian encampment,
consisting of more than 50 tents surrounded by metal fencing near the
main administration building on campus.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups have criticized law enforcement tactics on some
campuses, such as Atlanta’s Emory University and the University of Texas
at Austin, where police in riot gear and on horseback moved against
protesters last week, taking dozens into custody before charges were
dropped for lack of probable cause.</p>
<p>Protests, and arrests, flared anew on the Austin campus on
Monday.</p>
<p>Campus police backed by Texas state troopers attempted to break up a
large student protest using pepper spray and flash-bang charges,
arresting at least 43 people, according to defense attorney George Lobb,
who said he confirmed the number with court and jail staff processing
the detentions.</p>
<p>Video posted on social media showed police pulling individual
students from a gathering on a grassy area where demonstrators sat and
locked arms, some of them shouting, “Let them go!” State troopers in
riot gear stood guard behind the uniformed police.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech said on Monday that 91 protesters arrested on Sunday
night at a student-led encampment had been charged with trespassing.
Video posted on social media showed demonstrators chanting, “Shame on
you” as some were taken into custody.</p>

id="winner-of-1.3-billion-powerball-jackpot-is-an-immigrant-from-laos-who-has-cancer">Winner
of $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot is an immigrant from Laos who has
cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SALEM, Oregon — One of the winners of a $1.3 billion Powerball
jackpot this month is an immigrant from Laos who has had cancer for
eight years and had his latest chemotherapy treatment last week.</p>
<p>Cheng “Charlie” Saephan, 46, of Portland told a news conference held
by the Oregon Lottery on Monday that he and his 37-year-old wife,
Duanpen, are taking half the money, and the rest is going to a friend,
Laiza Chao, 55, of the Portland suburb of Milwaukie. Chao had chipped in
$100 to buy a batch of tickets with them. They are taking a lump sum
payment, $422 million after taxes.</p>
<p>“I will be able to provide for my family and my health,” he said,
adding that he’d “find a good doctor for myself.”</p>
<p>Saephan, who has two young children, said that as a cancer patient,
he wondered, “How am I going to have time to spend all of this money?
How long will I live?”</p>
<p>After they bought the shared tickets, Chao sent a photo of the
tickets to Saephan and said, “We’re billionaires.” It was a joke before
the actual drawing, he said, but the next day they won.</p>
<p>Chao, 55, was on her way to work when Saephan called her with the
news: “You don’t have to go anymore,” he said.</p>
<p>Saephan said he was born in Laos and moved to Thailand in 1987,
before immigrating to the U.S. in 1994. He wore a sash at the news
conference identifying himself as Iu Mien, a southeast Asian ethnic
group with roots in southern China. Many Iu Mein were subsistence
farmers and assisted American forces during the Vietnam war; after the
conflict, thousands of Iu Mien families fled to Thailand to avoid
retribution and eventually settled in the U.S.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Iu Mien people live along the West Coast, with a
sizeable and active community in Portland.</p>
<p>Saephan graduated from high school in 1996 and has lived in Portland
for 30 years. He worked as a machinist for an aerospace company.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the drawing, he wrote out numbers for the
game on a piece of paper and slept with it under his pillow, he said. He
prayed that he would win, saying, “I need some help — I don’t want to
die yet unless I have done something for my family first.”</p>
<p>The winning Powerball ticket was sold in early April at a Plaid
Pantry convenience store in Portland, ending a winless streak that had
stretched more than three months. The Oregon Lottery said it had to go
through a security and vetting process before announcing the identity of
the person who came forward to claim the prize.</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, with few exceptions, lottery players cannot remain
anonymous. Winners have a year to claim the top prize.</p>
<p>The jackpot had a cash value of $621 million before taxes if the
winner chose to take a lump sum rather than an annuity paid over 30
years, with an immediate payout followed by 29 annual installments. The
prize is subject to federal taxes and state taxes in Oregon.</p>
<p>The $1.3 billion prize is the fourth-largest Powerball jackpot in
history, and the eighth largest among U.S. jackpot games, according to
the Oregon Lottery.</p>
<p>The biggest U.S. lottery jackpot won was $2.04 billion in California
in 2022.</p>

released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
We’re pleased to announce that the latest edition of Datasentinel for
PostgreSQL is now available
</p>
<h4>
Role Based Access Enhancement
</h4>
<p>
Administrators can now assign multiple roles to Datasentinel users
either directly through the UI or programmatically via the API. This
enhancement significantly simplifies user management, especially in
large-scale environments with hundreds of PostgreSQL instances.
</p>
<h4>
Datasentinel 2024 Updates
</h4>
<p>
Datasentinel’s 2024 updates include full compatibility with PostgreSQL
16 and the introduction of <strong>I/O Insights</strong>, a new feature
that uses the pg_stat_io view to provide detailed I/O metrics.
Additionally, we have enhanced our agentless service startup, ensuring
quicker launch times and improved performance. This is particularly
beneficial in large-instance environments during system boots or
post-upgrade reboots. Together, these enhancements further bolster
Datasentinel’s robust PostgreSQL monitoring capabilities

Investors Aren’t Buying Your AI Startup</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
At San Francisco Climate Week, everyone wanted to talk about artificial
intelligence.
</p>
<p>
“I was looking through all of the events on SF Climate Week, and it
seemed like every single one of them had AI somewhere in the name,”
joked (sort of) Rohan Nuttell of OpenAI last week, while moderating a
panel called AI for Climate.
</p>
<p>
Sure, with over 300 events, there were opportunities for climate nerds
to learn about carbon dioxide removal or sustainable fashion or grid
infrastructure. But AI was inescapable. I heard from companies using
<a href="https://www.floodbase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AI
to monitor flood risk</u></a>, model
<a href="https://pachama.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forest
carbon sequestration</u></a>,
and<a href="https://www.rhizomedata.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
help utilities identify vulnerabilities</u></a> from climate threats. I
even learned about a company using
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ten-lives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AI
to decarbonize pet food. </u></a>
</p>
<p>
Yet one notable section of the climate world wasn’t buying the hype:
Investors. In my one-on-one conversations with venture capitalists and
other financiers throughout the week, the prevailing approach was wait
and see. It was a striking departure from the rest of Silicon Valley,
where 6-month-old AI startups are
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/six-month-old-ai-coding-startup-valued-at-2-billion-by-founders-fund?rc=7bjtip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>getting
multi-billion-dollar valuations</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“I think there are very few large business opportunities that have
single-handedly been unlocked,” Sophie Purdom, managing Partner at
climate tech VC Planeteer Capital, told me, with regards to AI. “Maybe
they make it better or faster or whatnot. But I don’t think we’ve seen a
whole lot of new large markets that have suddenly been uniquely unlocked
in climate.”
</p>
<p>
One problem is that AI can mean anything from “we have a machine
learning algorithm” to “we use a large language model to help write your
climate grant applications,”
<a href="https://streamlineclimate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
this company does</u></a>. But that distinction is important. Generative
AI, which takes in reams of data and spits out brand-new content (think
ChatGPT or DALL-E), is what’s been driving the AI hype machine since
OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022. Eventually, generative AI
could have powerful climate implications — think the development of
novel EV battery chemistries or synthesis of new, more climate-friendly
proteins.
</p>
<p>
But not quite yet, Shawn Xu, a partner at climate tech VC Lowercarbon
Capital, told me.
</p>
<p>
Xu said he was left disappointed after a Climate AI hackathon that
Lowercarbon hosted with OpenAI last year. “To be honest there was a lag
between the number of interesting AI engineers and founders who wanted
to go build real climate applications coming out of that hackathon.”
</p>
<p>
In the last couple of months though, Xu has been excited to see AI
companies proposing “foundational models” for sectors like materials
science and biology. These are generative models trained on large
datasets that can perform a wide variety of tasks, like a ChatGPT for
meteorology or architecture that could build weather models or design
green buildings. “But I don’t think that there has been a slam dunk case
on a company that we’re excited about yet,” Xu said.
</p>
<p>
This doesn’t mean that Lowercarbon and other climate tech investors are
avoiding AI investments. There are plenty of well-funded climate tech
companies using increasingly powerful machine learning models and
algorithms to analyze patterns in large datasets and predict outcomes.
It’s just that this isn’t exactly new. Companies across many industries
have been using this type of predictive AI for much of the last decade.
Now incorporating generative AI in the form of large language models is
becoming relatively common too.
</p>
<p>
“Anything that’s solving workflow inefficiencies, anything that’s
helping you get context from somewhere else, anything that’s helping you
understand more data,” are well understood applications of AI that Juan
Muldoon, a partner at climate software VC Energize Capital, told me he’s
excited about.
</p>
<p>
“I think you’re going to see it materially impact long-running
operational costs for [energy] projects,” Scott Jacobs, co-founder and
CEO of the sustainable infrastructure investment firm Generate Capital,
told me. “It’s just another use of technology replacing humans.”
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t always make for a particularly flashy business. Muldoon
cited one of Energize’s portfolio companies,
<a href="https://www.jupiterintel.com/request-demo?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search-paid&utm_campaign=18641792851&utm_content=151085843508&utm_term=jupiter%20intelligence&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwoa2xBhACEiwA1sb1BB1QF01o5O8J02M1bAigsw3QjML3wx7pdcc8bjDEFRUokIRVq3qauhoC_MkQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jupiter
Intelligence</u></a>, which “takes very, very large amounts of climate,
weather, and terrain data to be able to more accurately predict asset
level risks associated with particular climate events,” he explained.
“So that’s a data AI company. But it’s not really marketed that way.”
</p>
<p>
Maybe that’s because in this era, the term is almost self-evident. As an
old editor once told me, writing that a tech company uses “machine
learning” or “AI” to perform data analysis can be as mundane and obvious
as advertising that a company uses “the internet.” But as generative AI
moves beyond advanced chatbots and towards the type of broader
foundational models that Xu is most excited about, investment could heat
up.
</p>
<p>
Xu told me that Lowercarbon has made a yet-unannounced investment in a
company that gathers vast amounts of earth observation data, which could
hopefully one day be used to create a “foundational model for earth
science.” This model could potentially do things such as generate custom
maps to track natural disasters or the climate risks to crops and built
infrastructure. Xu says a company like this would be “a holy grail.”
</p>
<p>
Yet the main holdup to some of these “holy grail” companies is that we
often lack not only <em><em>enough</em></em> data but a comprehensive
understanding of how to characterize that data, said Clea Kolster,
partner and head of science at Lowercarbon.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve seen a lot of pitches on AI for chemistry,” she told me. And
while AI could spit out new atomic and molecular combinations for use in
novel battery cells, “the amount of those new things that are actually
going to be good is probably very small until you actually start to have
a better understanding of how many of these materials work in different
structures and environments.”
</p>
<p>
Even if scientists and researchers get a better handle on the datasets
they’re working with, Purdom told me she’s generally skeptical of
investing in companies that use AI to do basic R&amp;D, citing the buzzy
example of AI being used in
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valleys-newest-unicorn-is-a-mining-company-9d22ea6c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>critical
minerals exploration and extraction</u></a> “The competency of the
prospecting and the R&amp;D approach seems distinct to me from the
actual value extraction, physical resource extraction part of the
business,” she told me. The same could be said of using AI for battery
design or protein development. “I have seen few examples where the
platform approach of just the research and identification part is where
there’s been a big standalone business.”
</p>
<p>
Not to say everyone takes that point of view. Bay Area-based KoBold
Metals, an AI-enabled minerals exploration company, has raised over a
billion dollars, with Bill Gates’ climate tech VC, Breakthrough Energy
Ventures as a leading investor.
</p>
<p>
But overall, the potential for novel applications of AI in the climate
space is still largely being figured out. And in these early stages,
many climate investors are treading carefully.
</p>
<p>
“I have talked to a number of these AI companies,” Jacobs told me.
“They’re talking about climate impacts and they have real value
propositions that they’re going after. Great! But they don’t have real
success stories yet.”

This week, we’re getting important insights on how the U.S. economy is
doing. We’ll receive reports on consumer confidence, the unemployment
rate and how many jobs are out there. And in the middle of it all, the
Federal Reserve is meeting to discuss what to do with interest rates.
We’ll sort through it all. Plus, musicians love the sounds of nature.
Now, those sounds can help support environmental causes.

<p>If you sometimes find your RISC OS desktop a bit cluttered (which
speaking personally would make it much like my real desktop) one
solution is to close a few windows (or in the case of my actual desk,
put some stuff away). Another solution is to run a piece of software
that expands the size of the desktop beyond the visible area shown on
screen, and move some of your windows into other spaces, ready for

That’s about the same as the emissions from 9 million cars over the same

INVERTO. “The extra emissions resulting from this crisis will increase
companies’ carbon footprints – making it very hard to hit their net zero
targets,” said Sushank Agarwal, a managing director at the company.
About 80% of the world’s goods are traded by ship, and international
shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>There’s a new 9front release! So, what exactly is 9front, you may
ask? Well, after it became clear that Bell Labs wasn’t doing much with
plan9, a group of developers took matters into their own hands and
created 9front, a fork of plan9. Their latest release is called DO NOT
INSTALL, and brings things like more USB audio support, DNS over TLS,
WiFi support for the Raspberry Pi, I2C support, and much more. I’m not
particularly well-versed in the world of plan9, and more often than not
it feels like a form of high-level programming performance art that I’m
just not smart enough to understand. The whole community and its
associated web sites have a very unique feel to it, and I always feel
like I’m just not cool enough to be part of it. That’s not a dig at the
plan9 community – it’s more of an indictment of my lack of coolness.
Which really shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>

<h2 id="run0-a-systemd-based-more-secure-replacement-for-sudo">run0: a
systemd-based, more secure replacement for sudo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lennart Poettering, main developer of systemd, has announced run0, a
systemd-based replacement for the well-known sudo command that fixes
many of he inherent issues with the widely used tool to gain temporary
elevated privileges. There are various problems with sudo, which
basically come down to that it’s a large SUID binary, meaning it
consists of privileged code that unprivileged users can run from their
own context. This makes sudo a fairly large attack surface, and why
OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers from the same main
problem, it’s much smaller and reduces the attack surface considerably.
SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code
and inherit the execution context intended and controlled by
unprivileged code. By execution context I mean the myriad of properties
that a process has on Linux these days, from environment variables,
process scheduling properties, cgroup assignments, security contexts,
file descriptors passed, and so on and so on. A few of these settings
the kernel is nice enough to clean up automatically when a SUID binary
is invoked, but much of it has to be cleaned up by the invoked suid
binary. This has to be done very very carefully, and history has shown
that SUID binaries are generally pretty shit at that. ↫ Lennart
Poettering Poettering wants to address this problem, and has come up
with run0, which behaves like sudo, but works entirely differently and
is not SUID. Run0 asks the services manager to create a shell or command
under the target user’s ID, creating a new PTY, sending data back and
forth from the originating TTY and the new PTY. Or in other words: the
target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked
off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well,
admittedly, we <em>do</em> propagate $TERM, but that’s an explicit
exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist). One could say, “run0”
is closer to behaviour of “ssh” than to “sudo”, in many ways. Except
that it doesn’t bother with encryption or cryptographic authentication,
key management and stuff, but instead relies on the kernel’s local
identification mechanisms. run0 doesn’t implement a configuration
language of its own btw (i.e. no equivalent of /etc/sudoers). Instead,
it just uses polkit for that, i.e. how we these days usually let unpriv
local clients authenticate against priv servers. ↫ Lennart Poettering
This approach addresses a whole slew of attack vectors on sudo, and it
comes with fun additional features like being able to give your terminal
a different background tint when using it, or displaying a little red
dot in the terminal window title to further indicate you’re using
elevated privileges. It will ship as part of the upcoming release of
systemd 256.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this was a wild goose chase of a read. J. B. Crawford dove into
the history of something I’ve never heard of – Microsoft At Work – and
came away with a story that’ while clearer thanks to his research, is
still frustratingly nebulous. I’m still not entirely sure what Microsoft
At Work really was, but I think it had the goal of running Windows on
communications devices like faxes, to make it easier to share and work
on documents across various devices. Crawford did a lot of digging, and
eventually settles on what he thinks might be a description of what MAW
really consisted of. I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was
more ambitious than just installing Windows on a grape. The effort
included a unified communications protocol for the control of office
machines, including printers, for which a whole Microsoft stack was
envisioned. This built on top of the Windows Printing System, a
difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated MAW by a short
time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were actually on
the market when MAW was announced—MAW products were, we will learn, very
much not. MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a
new GUI intended to appear more modern while reducing resource
requirements. Some reporters at the time noted that Microsoft was cagey
about the supported architectures, I suspect they were waiting on ports
to be completed. The fax machine was probably x86, though, as there’s
little evidence MAW actually ran on anything else. ↫ J. B. Crawford The
’90s were a wild time, especially as Microsoft, and this MAW project
seems to have ’90s written all over it, but I’d still love to learn a
lot more about this. I hope this article will bring out some former
Microsoft execs or employees who can give us more details, and possibly
even some code. I want to know how this works and what it did.</p>

hostages. “I’m hopeful that they will make the right decision. </p>
<p>“We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic,” Blinken said. </p>
<p>A delegation from Hamas was due Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has
been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and
see hostages freed. Israel’s counter-offensive in Gaza has killed more
than 34,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, a figure
that Israel says includes several thousand Hamas fighters it has
killed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blinken said in Riyadh that the U.S. is close to finishing
a security agreement with Saudi Arabia that would be offered if the
country makes peace with Israel. </p>
<p>“The work that Saudi Arabia, the United States have been doing
together in terms of our own agreements, I think, is potentially very
close to completion,” Blinken told an audience at the World Economic
Forum. </p>
<p>He added the two nations have done intensive work together over the
last month on Israeli-Saudi normalization. </p>
<p>Blinken disclosed that he was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia and
Israel on October 10 last year to focus specifically on the Palestinian
part of the normalization deal because that is an essential component.
But it did not happen because of the Hamas terror attack on Israel. </p>
<p>“In order to move forward with normalization, two things will be
required: Calm in Gaza and a credible pathway to a Palestinian state,”
Blinken said. </p>
<p>U.S. officials have said creating a pathway to a Palestinian state
with security guarantees for Israel is key to lasting peace and security
in the Middle East and to Israel’s integration in the region. </p>
<p>Blinken met Monday with Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Mohammed bin Salman for nearly an hour to discuss the Gaza conflict and
ongoing tensions in the Mideast. He then headed to Jordan before another
stop in Israel, where he is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials. </p>
<p>The Biden administration continues to work on a potential security
agreement with Saudi Arabia that could lead to normalization of Saudi
relations with Israel, even as some officials and analysts consider it a
remote possibility. </p>
<p>Last week, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said
he plans to return to Saudi Arabia soon. Sullivan had earlier postponed
his trip to the Middle East due to a cracked rib. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected the two-state solution and the
return of the Palestinian Authority to control Gaza, demands that are
widely supported by the international community. </p>
<p>The Saudis have demanded, as a prerequisite, to see an Israeli
commitment to the two-state solution. </p>
<p>Nimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Middle East
Institute, told VOA in an email, “Saudi Arabia has been gradually
opening towards Israel for a decade. Significant progress was made in
the months prior to the Hamas attack of October 7, with the hope of
linking an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement to a pre-presidential
election, U.S.-Saudi defense pact. The war stalled the process, but
talks are continuing and are at a decisive phase.” </p>
<p>If Netanyahu’s opposition to the two-state solution remains
unchanged, Goren added, he might struggle to secure normalization with
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Humanitarian assistance</p>
<p>Speaking at a meeting with the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh
earlier Monday, Blinken said the best way to ease the humanitarian
crisis in Gaza is for there to be a cease-fire. </p>
<p>Blinken is visiting Riyadh, Amman, and Tel Aviv through Wednesday —
his seventh diplomatic mission to the Middle East region since the
Israel-Hamas war began more than six months ago. </p>
<p>Some analysts said the United States needs to fully enforce its law
and arms policy on Israel to ensure accountability and adequate
humanitarian aid delivery. </p>
<p>Ari Tolany, director of the Center for International Policy’s
security assistance monitor, told VOA, “U.S. law and policy will need to
hold its largest recipient of security assistance to account for a
meaningful peace.”</p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Sundat told
ABC’s “This Week” that the United States is continuing to push for a
six-week cease-fire. He said Israel has assured U.S. officials it will
not send ground troops into the southern Gaza city of Rafah without
fully hearing U.S. concerns that such an attack would endanger the lives
of more than 1 million Palestinians who are sheltering there. </p>
<p>Kirby said that a makeshift Mediterranean Sea pier being constructed
on the Gaza shoreline could be completed in two or three weeks so that
more humanitarian aid can be transported into the narrow territory to
help feed many starving Palestinians. </p>

Ownership: Your Time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjExMzM4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTg0MDQxM30.jB36r6Ts-Bc1Y90f9vMUNkn-WP9jKfNqLpya6XArOHk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
My wife used to speedrun to San Francisco. A full tank of gas powered
the little truck from Los Angeles to the halfway-point pit stop near
Coalinga, California, where the L.A. radio stations have faded into
static and the “Mr. Brightside” broadcasts from the Bay Area have yet to
reach over the horizon. With just that single stop, the trip could be
completed in under six hours.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that way these days in the EV. We stop twice for half-hour
recharging sessions — maybe three times if we leave home with a
less-than-full battery, and climbing over the
<a href="https://www.laalmanac.com/transport/tr27h.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Grapevine
mountain pass</u></a> punishes the range. Altogether, it makes the
journey seven hours or longer.
</p>
<p>
I don’t mind too much. Frankly, I’d rather take the occasional break
from holding my place in an endless line of cars all headed to the same
destination and all trying to pass the same tomato truck than make
slightly better time. If the day is already dedicated to a road trip,
then it doesn’t really change my life to arrive in six hours rather than
seven. Still, every time I undertake the I-5 marathon, the experience
makes it clear: the true cost of owning an electric vehicle is your
time.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1c1wiwk/hidden_costs_of_ev_ownership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Posts</u></a>
on platforms like Reddit about the hidden costs of EV ownership make me
think I’m not alone in this notion.
</p>
<p>
In strictly monetary costs, one can make a straightforward case that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/arguments-against-evs-bad" target="_self"><u>EV
life is better</u></a>. Government rebates and tax credits bring down
the upfront front cost to be closer to or nearly competitive with
combustion cars. Some recurring routine maintenance costs, like oil
changes, are absent. And depending on where you live and the current
state of the ever-changing calculus of gas vs. electricity costs, going
electric could save you a lot when prices soar at the pump. A
<em><em>New York Times
</em></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/15/climate/electric-car-cost.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>graphic</u></a>
from 2021 illustrates that EV owners really can have it all: lower
emissions and lower lifetime cost of ownership at the same time.
</p>
<p>
There are hidden EV costs in terms of dollars and cents, yes. States
have begun to institute extra fees to register an electric car, which is
nominally to offset the fact that EVs don’t pay the highway tax built
into the price of gasoline yet smacks of political theater. Serious
repairs can be expensive. EVs, because they’re powerful and heavy, seem
to burn through tires at a faster rate. While the cost of a gallon of
gas varies relatively little across town, the price of a kilowatt-hour
of electricity can vary wildly from overnight residential electricity to
the surge pricing one pays at a Los Angeles Supercharger in the middle
of day. If you don’t have home charging, you’re stuck paying the higher
rate — or going to get cheap electricity at odd hours, which is another
tax on your time.
</p>
<p>
A lot of those extra financial costs can be strategically mitigated. The
time penalty, not so much. While it mostly doesn’t matter, at least for
those who can plug in at home and keep their batteries always full
enough for their local driving, stopping on a long trip still takes far
longer than simply topping up a gas tank. Fast-charging has seen
technological leaps forward; whereas a lot of Tesla’s early
Superchargers built in the 2010s maxed out at 72 kilowatts, many DC
fast-chargers can now provide 250 or 350 kilowatts. But it still takes
15 to 20 minutes to refill the battery from nearly empty back to the 80%
or 90% you’ll want for the next leg of a road trip.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the not-insignificant time you spend
<em><em>thinking</em></em> about charging. Some people who haven’t
driven an EV seem to think range anxiety is an all-consuming cloud of
negative energy, that every mile is driven in a panic about where the
next plug will be. Yes, I’ve had my share of worried drives, mostly
because I pushed my older standard-range Tesla Model 3 to its limit by
trying to jump between distant chargers
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-national-parks-charging" target="_self"><u>in
the boonies of Arizona or Utah</u></a>. In truth, worrying about the
battery is more of a low-level mental white noise — something you must
always be slightly <em><em>aware of</em></em>, as opposed to the old
days of just noticing the needle is a little close to E and pulling off
the freeway. (Again, the penalty here is higher on renters and those
without home charging.)
</p>
<p>
Some of this, I’m afraid, may be unavoidable. To break free from burning
fossil fuels in your car is to give up the deal with the devil that gave
us the freedom to rarely think about energy.
</p>
<p>
The good news: As time goes on, these time penalties are fading. My
Model 3 that started life with (an
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-slashes-electric-car-range-171243019.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over-promised</u></a>)
240 miles of range requires a lot of extra stops on a very long trip. As
the range of a decent EV creeps up to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/whats-best-ev-range-300" target="_self"><u>300
miles</u></a> or more, we’re approaching a world where you’re not
stopping much more than you would in a gas-burning car, unless you’re
one of those drivers who refuses to take bathroom breaks to make good
time. With range and the number of fast-chargers on the road both
ticking upward, the anxiety of not making it to the next plug is
dissipating, too, giving you back some of your brain time to think about
something else.
</p>
<p>
EVs may never reach the
<a href="https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/consumer-information/consumer-resources/staying-safe-pump#:~:text=It%20may%20be%20a%20temptation,be%20discharged%20at%20the%20nozzle." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two
minutes</u></a> it takes to fill a gas tank. They may always ask just a
little more of you than a hybrid or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/phevs-2024-plug-in-hybrids" target="_self"><u>plug-in
hybrid</u></a> that conserves the gas engine to keep the range worries
at bay. But they might get close enough to gas-pump speed that, by the
time you stretch your legs, relieve yourself, and buy another colossal
can of Monster Energy, the car says it’s ready for you to resume your
trip.
</p>
<p>
Besides, if those few extra minutes make you feel a little saner while
also reducing the emissions of your road trip, then that’s time well
spent.

id="us-lawmakers-strike-deal-to-boost-aviation-safety-will-not-raise-pilot-retirement-age">US
lawmakers strike deal to boost aviation safety, will not raise pilot
retirement age</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House and Senate negotiators said early Monday they
had reached a deal to boost air traffic controller staffing and boost
funding to avert runway close-call incidents, but will not increase the
airline pilot retirement age to 67 from 65.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives in July voted 351-69 on a sweeping
bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that would
also raise the mandatory pilot retirement age to 67 but the Senate
Commerce Committee had voted in February to reject the retirement age
increase. International rules would have prevented airline pilots older
than 65 from flying in most countries outside the United States.</p>
<p>Congress has temporarily extended authorization for the FAA through
May 10 as it works on a new $105 billion, five-year deal. The Senate is
set to vote this week on the more than 1,000-page bipartisan
proposal.</p>
<p>The bill prohibits airlines from charging fees for families to sit
together and requires airlines to accept vouchers and credits for at
least five years, but did not adopt many stricter consumer rules sought
by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The bill also requires airplanes to be equipped with 25-hour cockpit
recording devices and directs the FAA to deploy advanced airport surface
technology to help prevent collisions.</p>
<p>Efforts to boost aviation safety in the United States have taken on
new urgency after a series of near-miss incidents and the Jan. 5 Alaska
Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug mid-air emergency.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, the panel’s top
Republican, Ted Cruz, House Transportation Committee chair Sam Graves
and the committee’s top Democrat, Rick Larsen, in a joint statement
announced the agreement and said, “now more than ever, the FAA needs
strong and decisive direction from Congress to ensure America’s aviation
system maintains its gold standard.”</p>
<p>The proposal raises maximum civil penalties for airline consumer
violations from $25,000 per violation to $75,000 and aims to address a
shortage of 3,000 air traffic controllers by directing the FAA to
implement improved staffing standards and to hire more inspectors,
engineers and technical specialists.</p>
<p>Congress will not establish minimum seat size requirements, leaving
that instead to the FAA. The bill requires the Transportation Department
to create a dashboard that shows consumers the minimum seat size for
each U.S. airline.</p>
<p>The bill boosts by five the number of daily direct flights from
Washington Reagan National Airport.</p>
<p>Cantwell said the agreement — including a five-year reauthorization
for the National Transportation Safety Board — demonstrates aviation
safety and stronger consumer standards are a big priority.</p>
