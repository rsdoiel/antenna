id="californias-new-law-forces-digital-stores-to-admit-youre-just-licensing-content-not-buying-it">California’s
new law forces digital stores to admit you’re just licensing content,
not buying it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law (AB 2426) to combat
“disappearing” purchases of digital games, movies, music, and ebooks.
The legislation will force digital storefronts to tell customers they’re
just getting a license to use the digital media, rather than suggesting
they actually own it. When the law comes into effect next year, it will
ban digital storefronts from using terms like “buy” or “purchase,”
unless they inform customers that they’re not getting unrestricted
access to whatever they’re buying. Storefronts will have to tell
customers they’re getting a license that can be revoked as well as
provide a list of all the restrictions that come along with it.
Companies that break the rule could be fined for false advertising. ↫
Emma Roth at The Verge A step in the right direction, but a lot more is
definitely needed. This law in particular seems to leave a lot of wiggle
room for companies to keep using the “purchase” term while hiding the
disclosure somewhere in the very, very small fine print. I would much
rather a law like this just straight up ban the use of the term
“purchase” and similar terms when all you’re getting is a license. Why
allow them to keep lying about the nature of the transaction in exchange
for some fine print somewhere? The software industry in particular has
been enjoying a free ride when it comes to consumer protection laws, and
the kind of malpractice, lack of accountability, and laughable quality
control would have any other industry shut down in weeks for severe
negligence. We’re taking baby steps, but it seems we’re finally arriving
at a point where basic consumer protection laws and rights are being
applied to software, too. Several decades too late, but at least it’s
something.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-hydrogen-cars-bit-is-funny-and-inaccurate">Trump’s
Hydrogen Cars Bit Is Funny and Inaccurate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY4NDEyMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTczMTMwM30.mg5TROplSLhPD63A8uzO_artr2Hlk46-ed4odLpxp5E/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Ever since Elon Musk
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>persuaded</u></a>”
Donald Trump to take it easy on his
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>electric
vehicle-bashing</u></a>, the former president’s EV riffs have gotten
pretty boring. Thank goodness, then, that there’s a new boogeyman in
town: <em><em>hydrogen cars</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
Never mind that there are
<a href="https://h2fcp.org/by_the_numbers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only
about 18,000 hydrogen cars on the roads</u></a> in the U.S. and so few
refueling stations that one of the two manufacturers of them, Toyota, is
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-13/class-action-lawsuit-highlights-total-inconvenience-of-refueling-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>getting
sued</u></a>. According to Trump, hydrogen cars are “the new thing,” as
he warned his supporters last week during a stop in Savannah, Georgia
(roughly 1,900 miles from
<a href="https://h2fcp.org/stationmap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
nearest hydrogen refueling station</u></a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
“They say the new thing is hydrogen cars, but they’re having a problem.
If it explodes, you end up about seven blocks away. And you’re dead. So
personally, I don’t know about you, but I’m gonna take a pass. But maybe
they’ll figure it out. But right now, I wouldn’t recommend it.”
[<a href="https://www.rawstory.com/trump-hydrogen-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>via
</u><u><em><em>RawStory</em></em></u></a>]
</blockquote>
<p>
This is, admittedly, a pretty funny bit — even if it’s totally
inaccurate, according to Bill Elrick, the executive director of the
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Partnership, a nonprofit group of auto manufacturers,
energy providers, and government agencies that promote hydrogen vehicles
in California. “I get where it comes from, and it is one of our biggest
challenges in the industry — helping people understand what hydrogen is
without diving into the depths of how a vehicle operates,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
As Elrick pointed out, when most people hear “hydrogen,” they think
either of water (“which is fine”), the Hindenburg disaster (“we don’t do
anything 100 years later the same way that we used to”), or, most
problematically, the hydrogen bomb. “That’s something that is a
completely different chemical reaction and, I think, where some of the
safety scare comes from,” Elrick told me.
</p>
<p>
But hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (or HFCVs) are no more a bomb than
gas-powered vehicles — perhaps <em><em>less</em></em> so, because they
must meet the same rigorous safety codes and standards as any other car
or truck on the road in addition to extra precautions to ensure the fuel
cells won’t be punctured in a bad accident or potentially leak.
</p>
<p>
In a HFCV, hydrogen stored in a high-pressure tank is mixed in a fuel
cell with oxygen from the air to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWOVzSmc72E&t=259s&ab_channel=BeyondFuel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">induce
a chemical reaction</a> that produces electricity, which powers an
electric motor that drives the car, just as it would in an EV. While
batteries and electricity are familiar concepts, however, and therefore
less scary as automotive power sources, current popular
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/use-of-hydrogen.php#:~:text=electric%20power%20generation.-,Hydrogen%20is%20used%20in%20industrial%20processes,the%20sulfur%20content%20of%20fuels." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>uses
of hydrogen</u></a>, such as refining oil and producing fertilizers, are
not as visible to most people going about their daily lives as, say,
their cell phones.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say hydrogen is 100% safe. “Anything that moves a vehicle
that weighs two tons or more — if it’s electricity, gasoline, or
hydrogen — clearly has dangers and risks associated with it,” Elrick
said. “If we could power our cars with <em><em>peanut butter</em></em>,
it would have that energy potential.” But car manufacturers (just like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-boat-car-electrocution-water" target="_self"><u>electric
boat manufacturers</u></a>) have considered the possibility of their
vehicles being involved in crashes and designed them accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The Center for Hydrogen Safety maintains a database of hydrogen-related
accidents
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/hydrogen-could-fuel-u-s-energy-transition-but-is-it-safe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
serve as “lessons learned”</u></a> as the technology continues to
develop. Though there are still relatively few HFCVs on the roads, as of
this spring there had been
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a41103863/hydrogen-cars-fcev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
recorded automotive fatalities</u></a> credited
<em><em>specifically</em></em> to hydrogen fuel cells. (In other words,
no one has ended up “about seven blocks away” dead from an explosion.)
One researcher
<a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/npre470/sp2019/web/readings/Hydrogen%20safety%20issues.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even
found</u></a> that “in a collision in open spaces,” an HFCV should
actually have “less potential hazard” than a gas car due to the
extensive precautions taken when building their tanks (“their hardware
would likely survive even if the rest of the car were destroyed in a
crash,”
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a41103863/hydrogen-cars-fcev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>per
</u><u><em><em>Car and Driver</em></em></u></a>).
</p>
<p>
But Trump’s HFCV-phobia probably isn’t the biggest takeaway here. Some
sectors of the hydrogen industry are potentially on the chopping block
if Trump returns to the White House — since, as my colleague Katie
Brigham writes, “green hydrogen made from renewable-powered
electrolyzers is expensive and the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>proposed
strict rules</u></a> that would allow it to qualify for the most
generous tax credit [would likely be]
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>goners</u></a>”
under a Republican administration. Trump’s suspicion of new uses for
hydrogen certainly doesn’t bode well.
</p>
<p>
As for any lingering fears about exploding hydrogen cars that Trump
might have planted — hey, at least it’d be a quicker end than
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-boat-car-electrocution-water" target="_self"><u>death-by-shark</u></a>.

of the Palisades nuclear power plant in Michigan</a> — the first in U.S.
history.
</p>
<p>
The plant was shuttered in 2022, and since 2023, state and federal
officials have been working to reopen the plant — as have the plant’s
owner, Holtec, and Wolverine Power, a power company that purchases power
on behalf of its member utilities. Those efforts received a boost Monday
morning with the closing of a $1.52 billion loan guarantee from the
Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, announced provisionally in
March, and more than $1.3 billion in funds from the Department of
Agriculture, split up between Wolverine Power and Hoosier Energy, a
cooperative serving rural utilities in Indiana and Illinois. The USDA
funds will defray a quarter of the cost of the power purchase agreement
between the cooperatives and Palisades, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture
Xochitl Torres Small told reporters.
</p>
<p>
The restarted plant would have some 800 megawatts of capacity, and the
project will employ some 600 people, said Deputy Secretary of Energy
Dave Turk on a call with reporters. The plant could be up and running in
“a couple of years,” an administration official said. “The funds from
this closed loan from the DOE announced today will be utilized in the
necessary inspections, testing, restoration, rebuilding, and replacement
of existing equipment,” the official said. Holtec is currently working
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on reauthorizing its license to
operate the plant.

Katie Brigham reported</a>. The federal agency and its official
nonprofit partner, the National Forest Foundation, have partnered with
the San Francisco-based company on a pilot program to turn leftover
trees and other debris from forest-thinning operations into bio-oil, a
liquid made from organic matter, to be injected underground. The project
is a part of a larger Cal Fire grant, to implement forest health
measures as well as seek out innovative biomass utilization solutions.
If the pilot scales up, Charm can generate carbon removal credits by
permanently locking away the CO2 from biomass, while the Forest Service
will finally find a use for the piles of leftover trees that are too
small for the sawmill’s taste. The pilot is taking place in Inyo
National Forest in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, and comprises 538 acres of
forest. Charm is processing just 60 tons of biomass over six weeks of
operation in Inyo. The pilot is already more than halfway over.

simultaneously tightening restrictions on high polluting coal power

<h2 id="at-100-former-president-jimmy-carters-legacy-reevaluated">At
100, former President Jimmy Carter’s legacy reevaluated</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — When he returned to Plains, Georgia, in 1981,
President Jimmy Carter was defeated — rejected by voters in a landslide
election to Republican Ronald Reagan. The pouring rain at Carter’s
welcome home reception reflected his gloomy mood and that of the
country.</p>
<p>“In office, he was a political failure. He lost overwhelming[ly] to
Ronald Reagan. But he was a substantive and visionary success,” says
author and historian Jonathan Alter, who recognizes what many know
Carter for today — humanitarian work with his Carter Center, “waging
peace, fighting disease and building hope” around the world that led to
Jimmy Carter receiving the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>“He’s done terrific work supervising elections in more than 100
countries. But former presidents don’t have as much power as presidents,
not nearly as much, and the list of his accomplishments as president
that were ignored, minimized, or forgotten entirely was very long,” said
Alter.</p>
<p>The Iran hostage crisis, rising inflation and oil embargoes of the
1970s doomed Carter’s White House tenure, casting a long shadow over his
legacy. However, the onetime peanut farmer, Georgia governor, president
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate’s 100th birthday milestone comes as
authors and historians reevaluate his failures and accomplishments as a
one-term U.S. president.</p>
<p>Alter’s biography, “His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, A Life,” is among
several that conclude his four years in the White House were anything
but a failure.</p>
<p>“Not just famously [the] Camp David accords and opening relations
with China,” Alter told VOA in an interview in August at the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, “but a long string of legislative
accomplishments on the environment and many other issues that actually
exceed the legislative accomplishments of both Barack Obama and Bill
Clinton.”</p>
<p>Carter signed the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act protecting more than 100 million acres — including land, national
parks, refuges, monuments, forests and conservation areas — which Alter
says is now considered one of the most important pieces of environmental
legislation ever passed.</p>
<p>“The story I tell in my book is a surprising one,” says Alter. “It’s
of somebody who worked hard in ways that actually bore fruit.”</p>
<p>“I think we’ll remember President Carter as a president who served in
very enormously difficult times who had to deal with circumstances that
were far beyond his control,” says Emory University’s first “Jimmy
Carter Professor of History” Joseph Crespino. Carter routinely visited
with Crespino and his students in Atlanta to discuss the good and bad
decisions he made while president.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Putting human rights front and center in American foreign policy —
no president had done that in the way that Jimmy Carter had,” Crespino
told VOA during a recent interview at his office on campus at Emory
University. “It was important in shifting the balance of power in the
Cold War, but it was also an important moment in the aftermath of the
Vietnam War to reassert once again America’s moral responsibilities in
the world.”</p>
<p>Crespino says some of Carter’s overlooked domestic accomplishments
include reorganizing the federal government and deregulation of the
airline, trucking and beer industries. “We oftentimes associate a kind
of freeing up of the free enterprise economy with the conservative turn
that came in with Ronald Reagan, when in fact Jimmy Carter before Reagan
was already doing a lot of deregulatory work in his presidency in
recognizing the kind of limits of government oversight of these private
industries.”</p>
<p>Members of Carter’s Cabinet, including former United Nations
Ambassador Andrew Young, are grateful his long life has allowed him to
witness the longer lens of history reflect more positively on his
legacy.</p>
<p>“There’s no place in the world I know where people don’t have some
good things to say about him,” Young told VOA as he spoke with reporters
September 17 at Carter’s 100th birthday concert at the Fox theater in
Atlanta. “Whether he succeeded or not … he gave it as good a try and
came as far as the world would let him go.”</p>
<p>A world that continues to benefit from the Carter Center’s work,
including fighting diseases including Guinea worm, which is down to a
few cases in Africa and could become only the second disease ever
eradicated.</p>

id="former-president-jimmy-carter-reaches-historic-100th-birthday">Former
President Jimmy Carter Reaches Historic 100th Birthday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — In a celebration fit for a centenarian, the
historic Fox theater in Atlanta recently hosted dozens of musical acts
and thousands of guests for a concert celebrating the 100th birthday of
Georgia’s one-time governor, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to be together and I think that’s who he is
fundamentally,” said Jason Carter, who said he believes the concert,
featuring some performers that also campaigned for his grandfather in
the 1970s, is a unifying – and bipartisan – way to celebrate what one
documentary film director calls the “Rock ’n Roll President.”</p>
<p>“It’s one of those fundamental human connections that brings people
together across geographies, across culture, across any sort of racial
dividing lines,” Jason Carter told VOA during a press event ahead of the
performances. “You’ll have both Democrats and Republicans here
tonight.”</p>
<p>Despite the many speakers, actors, musicians and former presidents
who sent video tributes, the one person noticeably absent from the
celebration was Jimmy Carter himself. He remains in hospice care at his
home 240 kilometers south of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“It’s a 600-person village in the middle of nowhere, and all of his
other work at the end of the road in Africa, Mali, South Sudan, has been
in those same kinds of 600-person villages,” Jason Carter said.</p>
<p>“He feels a kinship there and he feels a connection and the way that
he marks this moment is by being at home.”</p>
<p>Jason Carter said his grandfather will watch the concert broadcast on
Georgia Public Television, as he celebrates his historic milestone
birthday in Plains, Georgia, not far from where his story began, at the
Wise Sanitarium, where on October 1, 1924, Lillian Carter, then a nurse
at the facility, gave birth to the first U.S. president to have been
born in a hospital. The facility is now called the Lillian G. Carter
Nursing Center.</p>
<p>“But the only reason he was born in a hospital was because his mother
was working that day,” Jill Stuckey, a Carter family friend, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Stuckey serves as superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National
Historic Site in Plains which includes Carter’s preserved Depression-era
boyhood farm, the old Plains High School where Carter studied and the
railroad depot Carter converted into his campaign headquarters in his
successful 1976 White House bid.</p>
<p>“After the hospice announcement nearly a year ago, I didn’t think
we’d be at this point,” Stuckey said during an interview with VOA,
standing next to a replica of the famous Resolute Desk from the White
House Oval Office, now a big draw for tourists who visit Plains High
School.</p>
<p>Stuckey said Plains celebrates its famous neighbor every day, but
this historic birthday is marked by serving others.</p>
<p>“We’re naturalizing 100 new citizens in his honor. Thanks to the
secretary of the Navy, we’re having four F-18 jets flyover.”</p>
<p>She said another, smaller birthday concert in the Plains High School
auditorium is also meant to help the community celebrate the man who
rose from being a local peanut farmer to president of the United
States.</p>
<p>“He definitely deserves a lot of fanfare, because he’s definitely the
greatest person I’ve ever met in my life,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Carter’s milestone is a bittersweet occasion in Plains, though, it’s
the first Carter has spent since his wife, Rosalynn, died last
November.</p>
<p>“Seventy-seven-and-a-half years of marriage, to be without your
partner, your soul mate you know it’s very, very tough times,” said
Stuckey, “It’s tough times on him, but on all of us that knew her, that
loved her, the family members.”</p>
<p>Carter’s birthday celebration, which began at the Fox theater in
September and ends in Plains October 1, brought his large extended
family together, including his great-grandson, Charlie Carter, who
hinted it may not be the last time such a gathering occurs.</p>
<p>“No… maybe his 101th?”</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter also holds the record for the longest post-presidential
career. After departing the White House in 1981, he and Rosalynn founded
the Atlanta-based global nonprofit Carter Center, which fights neglected
tropical diseases, promotes peaceful conflict resolution, and monitors
elections around the world, causes which led to Carter winning the 2002
Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

carbon from the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The federal agency and its official nonprofit partner, the National
Forest Foundation, have partnered with San Francisco-based Charm on a
pilot program to turn leftover trees and other debris from
forest-thinning operations into bio-oil, a liquid made from organic
matter, to be injected underground. The project is a part of a larger
<a href="https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/cal-fire-forest-health-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire grant</u></a>, to implement forest health measures as well as seek
out innovative biomass utilization solutions. If the pilot scales up,
Charm can generate carbon removal credits by permanently locking away
the CO2 from biomass, while the Forest Service will finally find a use
for the piles of leftover trees that are too small for the sawmill’s
taste.
</p>
<p>
“It’s actually pretty shocking how big the backlog of wildfire fuel
reduction projects is in the United States,” Peter Reinhardt, co-founder
and CEO at Charm, told me. “The pattern of putting out fires as much as
possible, as quickly as possible, has created just an enormous amount of
fuel in our forests that has to be treated one way or another.”
Controlled burns and forest thinning are the primary ways of dealing
with this fuel buildup, but as Reinhardt explained to me, California has
few pellet mills, and thus few offtakers for leftover wood. What’s left
often ends up being burned in a big pile.
</p>
<p>
That’s common at Inyo, which is considered a “biomass utilization
desert,” according to Katlyn Lonergan, a program coordinator with the
National Forest Foundation. NFF is paying Charm a nominal fee to take
the waste biomass off their hands, though not nearly enough to
constitute a primary source of revenue for the company.
</p>
<p>
At this point, funding isn’t a problem at Charm. Last year, the company
announced a
<a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/accelerating-carbon-removal-with-our-100m-series-b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$100
million Series B</u></a> round and received a
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/writing/first-offtake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$53
million commitment from Frontier</u></a>, the Big Tech-led carbon
removal initiative, to permanently remove 112,000 tons of CO2 between
2024 and 2030, the coalition’s first offtake agreement. At the time,
Charm had delivered over 6,000 tons of removal, “more than any other
permanent CDR supplier to date,”
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio/charm-industrial#:~:text=Charm%20has%20an%20impressive%20track%20record%20of%20execution.%20In%20just%20three%20years%20Charm%20progressed%20from%20a%20concept%20to%20being%20a%20leader%20in%20the%20space%E2%80%94delivering%20%3E6%2C000%20tons%20of%20removal%2C%20more%20than%20any%20other%20permanent%20CDR%20supplier%20to%20date." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
group wrote</u></a>. Since then, the company has received
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>an
additional $50,000</u></a> from the Department of Energy and is
currently in the running for a DOE carbon removal purchase prize of up
to $3 million.
</p>
<p>
Charm’s process begins with woody biomass and an industrial chipper,
after which the biomass is screened and dried. The chips are then
rapidly heated in a low oxygen environment, a process called fast
pyrolysis, which vaporizes the cellulose in the biomass. The remaining
plant matter is then condensed into a liquid and injected thousands of
feet underground.
</p>
<p>
Until now, the company has gotten
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/26/1052671/charm-industrials-carbon-removal-corn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more</u></a>
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/inside-charm-industrials-multimillion-dollar-bid-to-remove-co2-with-plants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attention</u></a>
for its efforts to use
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carbon-removal-startup-charm-industrial-53-million-frontier-2023-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agricultural
biomass</u></a> like corn stalks. But Reinhardt told me that lately,
100% of the company’s feedstock comes from “fuel load reduction
projects,” — unhealthy trees that have been cut down — though in the
future, it plans to source from both agricultural and forest waste. The
change in feedstock prioritization, Reinhardt said, is due to wildfires
becoming “a more and more urgent issue,” plus the advantages that come
from working with denser materials. “Almost all the cost of biomass is
in the logistics, and the cost of logistics is driven by density,” he
said. Transporting puffy bales of corn stalks, leaves, and husks to
Charm’s pyrolyzer is just not as energy efficient as trucking a log.
</p>
<p>
And because there are <em><em>already</em></em> plenty of piles of logs
and residue sitting around in forests like Inyo, if Charm can bring its
pyrolizers directly <em><em>to</em></em> the forest, it can increase
efficiency still further. Bringing Charm’s operations onsite could
eventually help the Forest Service save money, too. “The Eastern Sierra,
it’s pretty isolated for this industry,” Lonergan told me. “And so we
are actually hauling that [biomass] to Carson City, which is three and a
half hours away.”
</p>
<p>
Fixing the agency’s transportation woes is a ways away though — Charm is
starting small, processing just 60 tons of biomass over six weeks of
operation in Inyo. The pilot is already more than halfway over.
</p>
<p>
Charm won’t be claiming carbon removal credits for this project, as
Reinhardt told me it’s more a “demonstration of the production” to make
sure the logistics work out. Scaling up will mean deploying larger
pyrolyzers that can process significantly more biomass. “Our next
iteration of pyrolyzers will be probably 10x the throughput,” Reinhardt
told me. “So instead of 1 or one-and-a-half tons a day, about 10 to 15
tons a day.” Those numbers start to sound pretty darn small, though,
when you consider the amount of forestry biomass and agricultural
residue generated per year, which Reinhardt said is around 50 million
tons and 300 million tons, respectively.
</p>
<p>
And while this particular project comprises 538 acres of forest,
California alone has set a goal of thinning 1 million acres per year to
reduce wildfire risk. Basically, Charm’s not going to run out of
feedstock anytime soon, and the Forest Service isn’t going to find a
quick fix for its piles and piles of unwanted wood. “I don’t envision it
being the one solution that fits all,” Lonergan said of Charm’s
technology. But, she told me, “it can absolutely contribute to these
biomass materials that we don’t have an answer for yet.”

<h2 id="cosmic-alpha-2-released">COSMIC alpha 2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>System76, the premiere Linux computer manufacturer and creator of the
COSMIC desktop environment, has updated COSMIC’s Alpha release to Alpha
2. The latest release includes more Settings pages, the bulk of
functionality for COSMIC Files, highly requested window management
features, and considerable infrastructure work for screen reader
support, as well as some notable bug fixes. ↫ system76’s blog The pace
of development for COSMIC remains solid, even after the first alpha
release. This second alpha keeps adding a lot of things considered basic
for any desktop environment, such as settings panels for power and
battery, sounds, displays, and many more. It also brings window
management support for focus follows cursor and cursor follows focus,
which will surely please the very specific, small slice of people who
swear by those. Also, you can now disable the super key. A major new
feature that I’m personally very happy about is the “adjust density”
feature. COSMIC will allow you to adjust the spacing between the various
user interface elements so you can choose to squeeze more information on
your screen, which is one of the major complaints I have about modern UI
design in macOS, Windows, and GNOME. Being able to adjust this to your
liking is incredibly welcome, especially combined with COSMIC’s ability
to change from ’rounded’ UI elements to ‘square’ UI elements. The file
manager has also been vastly, vastly improved, tons of bugs were fixed,
and much, much more. It seems COSMIC is on the right path, and I can’t
wait to try out the first final result once it lands.</p>

<h2 id="kris-kristofferson-singer-songwriter-and-actor-dies-at-88">Kris
Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft
writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar
and A-list Hollywood actor, has died.</p>
<p>Kristofferson died at his home in Maui, Hawaii on Saturday, family
spokesperson Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88.</p>
<p>McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his
family. No cause was given. He was 88.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such
classics standards as “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” “Help Me Make It
Through the Night,” “For the Good Times” and “Me and Bobby McGee.”
Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best
known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning “For the Good
Times” or Janis Joplin belting out “Me and Bobby McGee.”</p>
<p>Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove
intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into
popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and
counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed
of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John
Prine and Tom T. Hall.</p>
<p>“There’s no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,” Nelson
said during a November 2009 award ceremony for Kristofferson held by
BMI. “Everything he writes is a standard and we’re all just going to
have to live with that.”</p>
<p>As an actor, he played the leading man opposite Barbara Streisand and
Ellen Burstyn, but also had a fondness for shoot-out Westerns and cowboy
dramas.</p>
<p>He was a Golden Gloves boxer and football player in college, received
a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of
Oxford in England and turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in
Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time
janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan
recorded tracks for the seminal “Blonde on Blonde” double album.</p>
<p>At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life.
Johnny Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how
Kristofferson, a former U.S. Army pilot, landed a helicopter on Cash’s
lawn to give him a tape of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down” with a beer in
one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all
respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the
‘man in black’ wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song
that no one ever actually cut, and he certainly couldn’t fly a
helicopter holding a beer.</p>
<p>In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not
have had a career without Cash.</p>
<p>“Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand
Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,” Kristofferson said.
“It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of
my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me
on stage the first time.”</p>
<p>One of his most recorded songs, “Me and Bobby McGee,” was written
based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster.
Foster had a song title in his head called “Me and Bobby McKee,” named
after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an
interview in the magazine, Performing Songwriter, that he was inspired
to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after
watching the Frederico Fellini film, “La Strada.”</p>
<p>Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the
lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before
she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous
No. 1 hit for Joplin.</p>
<p>Hits that Kristofferson recorded include “Why Me,” “Loving Her Was
Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do),” “Watch Closely Now,” “Desperados
Waiting for a Train,” “A Song I’d Like to Sing” and “Jesus Was a
Capricorn.”</p>
<p>In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they
had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They
divorced in 1980.</p>

<h2 id="harris-to-campaign-again-in-swing-state-nevada">Harris to
campaign again in swing-state Nevada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Vice President Kamala Harris is set to rally in Las
Vegas on Sunday night as both she and Republican Donald Trump continue
to make frequent trips to Nevada, looking to gain momentum in the swing
state as Election Day nears.</p>
<p>The rally is part of Harris’ latest West Coast swing, which included
making her first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border since taking over for
President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket. On Friday,
the vice president walked alongside a towering, rust-colored border wall
fitted with barbed wire in Douglas, Arizona, and met with federal
authorities.</p>
<p>She attended a San Francisco fundraiser Saturday and had plans for a
Sunday event in Los Angeles before heading to Nevada, with a return to
Washington set for Monday night.</p>
<p>“This race is as close as it could possibly be,” she said Saturday to
a raucous crowd of donors. “This is a margin-of-error race.”</p>
<p>Harris said even if there is enthusiasm, she’s running like an
underdog. And she invited people to “join our team in battleground
states” to help get voters to the polls — even if it’s Californians
making calls from home.</p>
<p>On Sunday, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake became the latest prominent
Republican to endorse Harris and Walz. He credited them with a “fine
character and love of country” and said he wants a president who does
not treat political adversaries as enemies or try to subvert the will of
voters.</p>
<p>Flake, a longtime critic of the former president, joins a list of
anti-Trump Republicans who have said they will vote for the Democratic
ticket, not just refrain from voting for Trump. Among them is Dick
Cheney, the deeply conservative former vice president, and his daughter,
Liz.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, a former Republican
governor and a sharp critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his
vote, though Trump won’t get it.</p>
<p>In Nevada, all voters automatically receive ballots by mail unless
they opt out — a pandemic-era change that was set in state law. That
means most ballots could start going out in a matter of weeks, well
before Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Harris plans to be back in Las Vegas on Oct. 10 for a town hall with
Hispanic voters. Both she and Republican rival Donald Trump have
campaigned frequently in the city, highlighting the critical role that
Nevada, and its mere six votes in the Electoral College, could play in
deciding an election expected to be exceedingly close.</p>
<p>Trump held his own Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13 at the Expo World
Market Center, where Harris is speaking Sunday. Her campaign has
frequently scheduled events in the same venue where her opponent
previously spoke, including in Milwaukee, Atlanta and suburban Phoenix.
During his Las Vegas event, the former president singled out people
crossing into the U.S. illegally, saying Harris “would be the president
of invasion.”</p>
<p>During a campaign stop in the city in June, Trump promised to
eliminate taxes on tips received by waiters, hotel workers and thousands
of other service industry employees. Harris used her own Las Vegas rally
in August to make the same promise.</p>
<p>Fully doing away with federal taxes on tips would probably require an
act from Congress. Still, Nevada’s Culinary Union, which represents
60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, has endorsed
Harris.</p>
<p>Ted Pappageorge, the culinary union’s secretary-treasurer, said the
difference between the dueling no-taxes-on-tips proposals is that Harris
has also pledged to tackle what his union calls “sub-minimum wage,”
where employers pay service industry workers small salaries and meet
minimum wage thresholds by expecting employees to supplement those with
tips.</p>
<p>Harris has no public schedule for Tuesday, when her running mate,
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, squares off against Republican Ohio Sen. JD
Vance for the first and only vice presidential debate of the campaign.
But Harris and Walz will campaign jointly on Wednesday, making a bus
tour with various stops through central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The campaign says that during that swing, both will emphasize plans
to energize U.S. manufacturing, including by using tax credits to
encourage steel production and overhaul federal permitting systems to
increase American construction.</p>

id="stuck-nasa-astronauts-welcome-spacex-capsule-to-bring-them-home-next-year">Stuck
NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule to bring them home next year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida — The two astronauts stuck at the
International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with
Sunday’s arrival of a SpaceX capsule.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew
of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and
Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in
darkness high over Botswana as the two craft soared 420 kilometers above
Earth.</p>
<p>NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over
the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner
test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and
helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly
understood to risk the test pilots’ return. So Starliner returned to
Earth empty earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Dragon carrying NASA’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s
Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February,
turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams
into a mission lasting more than eight months.</p>
<p>Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for
Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.</p>
<p>NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so.
SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company’s first astronaut
flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space
shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues
led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs.</p>
<p>Starliner inspections are underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,
with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week.</p>
<p>“We’re a long way from saying, ‘Hey, we’re writing off Boeing,’”
NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch
briefing.</p>
<p>The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up
there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in
just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the
Starliner turmoil.</p>
<p>Although Saturday’s liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket’s spent
upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific
because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon
launches until it figures out what went wrong.</p>

id="california-governor-vetoes-bill-to-create-first-in-nation-ai-safety-measures">California
governor vetoes bill to create first-in-nation AI safety measures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a
landmark bill aimed at establishing first-in-the-nation safety measures
for large artificial intelligence models Sunday.</p>
<p>The decision is a major blow to efforts attempting to rein in the
homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. The
bill would have established some of the first regulations on large-scale
AI models in the nation and paved the way for AI safety regulations
across the country, supporters said.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, the Democratic governor told an audience at
Dreamforce, an annual conference hosted by software giant Salesforce,
that California must lead in regulating AI in the face of federal
inaction but that the proposal “can have a chilling effect on the
industry.”</p>
<p>The proposal, which drew fierce opposition from startups, tech giants
and several Democratic House members, could have hurt the homegrown
industry by establishing rigid requirements, Newsom said.</p>
<p>“While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether
an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical
decision-making or the use of sensitive data,” Newsom said in a
statement. “Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the
most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not
believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real
threats posed by the technology.”</p>
<p>Newsom on Sunday instead announced that the state will partner with
several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop
guardrails around powerful AI models. Li opposed the AI safety
proposal.</p>
<p>The measure, aimed at reducing potential risks created by AI, would
have required companies to test their models and publicly disclose their
safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for
example, wipe out the state’s electric grid or help build chemical
weapons. Experts say those scenarios could be possible in the future as
the industry continues to rapidly advance. It also would have provided
whistleblower protections to workers.</p>
<p>The legislation is among a host of bills passed by the legislature
this year to regulate AI, fight deepfakes and protect workers. State
lawmakers said California must take action this year, citing hard
lessons they learned from failing to rein in social media companies when
they might have had a chance.</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure, including Elon Musk and Anthropic, said
the proposal could have injected some levels of transparency and
accountability around large-scale AI models, as developers and experts
say they still don’t have a full understanding of how AI models behave
and why.</p>
<p>The bill targeted systems that require more than $100 million to
build. No current AI models have hit that threshold, but some experts
said that could change within the next year.</p>
<p>“This is because of the massive investment scale-up within the
industry,” said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who
resigned in April over what he saw as the company’s disregard for AI
risks. “This is a crazy amount of power to have any private company
control unaccountably, and it’s also incredibly risky.”</p>
<p>The United States is already behind Europe in regulating AI to limit
risks. The California proposal wasn’t as comprehensive as regulations in
Europe, but it would have been a good first step to set guardrails
around the rapidly growing technology that is raising concerns about job
loss, misinformation, invasions of privacy and automation bias,
supporters said.</p>
<p>A number of leading AI companies last year voluntarily agreed to
follow safeguards set by the White House, such as testing and sharing
information about their models. The California bill would have mandated
that AI developers follow requirements similar to those commitments,
said the measure’s supporters.</p>
<p>But critics, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, argued
that the bill would “kill California tech” and stifle innovation. It
would have discouraged AI developers from investing in large models or
sharing open-source software, they said.</p>
<p>Newsom’s decision to veto the bill marks another win in California
for big tech companies and AI developers, many of whom spent the past
year lobbying alongside the California Chamber of Commerce to sway the
governor and lawmakers from advancing AI regulations.</p>
<p>Two other sweeping AI proposals, which also faced mounting opposition
from the tech industry and others, died ahead of a legislative deadline
in August. The bills would have required AI developers to label
AI-generated content and ban discrimination from AI tools used to make
employment decisions.</p>
<p>The governor said earlier this summer he wanted to protect
California’s status as a global leader in AI, noting that 32 of the
world’s top 50 AI companies are located in the state.</p>
<p>He has promoted California as an early adopter as the state could
soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion, provide
tax guidance and streamline homelessness programs. The state also
announced last month a voluntary partnership with AI giant Nvidia to
help train students, college faculty, developers and data scientists.
California is also considering new rules against AI discrimination in
hiring practices.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, Newsom signed some of the toughest laws in the
country to crack down on election deepfakes and measures to protect
Hollywood workers from unauthorized AI use.</p>
<p>But even with Newsom’s veto, the California safety proposal is
inspiring lawmakers in other states to take up similar measures, said
Tatiana Rice, deputy director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a
nonprofit that works with lawmakers on technology and privacy
proposals.</p>
<p>“They are going to potentially either copy it or do something similar
next legislative session,” Rice said. “So it’s not going away.”</p>

id="supplies-are-rushed-to-north-carolina-communities-left-isolated-after-helene">Supplies
are rushed to North Carolina communities left isolated after Helene</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PERRY, Fla. — North Carolina officials pledged to get more water and
other supplies to flood-stricken areas by Monday after Hurricane Helene
left a trail of destruction across the U.S. Southeast and the death toll
from the storm rose to nearly 100.</p>
<p>At least 91 people across several states were killed. A North
Carolina county that includes the mountain city of Asheville reported 30
people killed.</p>
<p>Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as rescuers and other
emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed roads, failing
infrastructure and widespread flooding.</p>
<p>Supplies were being airlifted to the region around the isolated city
of Asheville. Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder pledged that she
would have food and water to the city by Monday.</p>
<p>“We hear you. We need food and we need water,” Pinder said on a
Sunday call with reporters. “My staff has been making every request
possible to the state for support and we’ve been working with every
single organization that has reached out. What I promise you is that we
are very close.”</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as
rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed
roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding.</p>
<p>Officials warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes
and property would be lengthy and difficult. The storm upended life
throughout the Southeast. Deaths also were reported in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>Cooper implored residents in western North Carolina to avoid travel,
both for their own safety and to keep roads clear for emergency
vehicles. More than 50 search teams spread throughout the region in
search of stranded people.</p>
<p>One rescue effort involved saving 41 people north of Asheville.
Another mission focused on saving a single infant. The teams found
people through both 911 calls and social media messages, North Carolina
National Guard Adjutant General Todd Hunt said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden described the impact of the storm as “stunning”
and said he would visit the area this week as long as it does not
disrupt rescues or recovery work.</p>
<p>In a brief exchange with reporters, he said that the administration
is giving states “everything we have” to help with their response to the
storm.</p>
<p>Hurricane Helene roared ashore late Thursday in Florida’s Big Bend
region as a Category 4 hurricane with 225 kph winds. A weakened Helene
quickly moved through Georgia, then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee
with torrential rains that flooded creeks and rivers and strained
dams.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of water rescues, including in rural Unicoi
County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were
plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday.</p>
<p>More than 2 million homeowners and other utility customers were still
without power Sunday night. South Carolina had the most outages and
Gov. Henry McMaster asked for patience as crews dealt with widespread
snapped power poles.</p>
<p>“We want people to remain calm. Help is on the way, it is just going
to take time,” McMaster told reporters outside the airport in Aiken
County.</p>
<p>The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North
Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 61
centimeters of rain from Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>Jessica Drye Turner in Texas had begged for someone to rescue her
family members stranded on their rooftop in Asheville amid rising
floodwaters. “They are watching 18-wheelers and cars floating by,”
Turner wrote in an urgent Facebook post on Friday.</p>
<p>But in a follow-up message Saturday, Turner said help had not arrived
in time to save her parents, both in their 70s, and her 6-year-old
nephew. The roof collapsed and the three drowned.</p>
<p>“I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my
sisters and I are going through,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The state was sending water supplies and other items toward Buncombe
County and Asheville, but mudslides blocking Interstate 40 and other
highways prevented supplies from making it. The county’s own water
supplies were on the other side of the Swannanoa River, away from where
most of the 270,000 people in Buncombe County live, officials said.</p>
<p>Law enforcement was making plans to send officers to places that
still had water, food or gas because of reports of arguments and threats
of violence, the county sheriff said.</p>
<p>FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell toured south Georgia on Sunday and
planned to be in North Carolina Monday.</p>
<p>“It’s still very much an active search and rescue mission” in western
North Carolina, Criswell said. “And we know that there’s many
communities that are cut off just because of the geography” of the
mountains, where damage to roads and bridges have cut off certain
areas.</p>
<p>Biden on Saturday pledged federal government help for Helene’s
“overwhelming” devastation. He also approved a disaster declaration for
North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected
individuals.</p>
<p>In Florida’s Big Bend, some lost nearly everything they own. With
sanctuaries still darkened as of Sunday morning, some churches canceled
regular services while others like Faith Baptist Church in Perry opted
to worship outside.</p>
<p>Standing water and tree debris still covers the grounds of Faith
Baptist Church. The church called on parishioners to come “pray for our
community” in a message posted to the congregation’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>“We have power. We don’t have electricity,” Immaculate Conception
Catholic Church parishioner Marie Ruttinger said. “Our God has power.
That’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it looked “like a bomb
went off” after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways
from the air.</p>
<p>In eastern Georgia near the border with South Carolina, officials
notified Augusta residents Sunday morning that water service would be
shut off for 24 to 48 hours in the city and surrounding Richmond
County.</p>

boosts air support and hikes troops’ readiness to deploy for Middle
East</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. military said on Sunday it was increasing its
air support capabilities in the Middle East and putting troops on a
heightened readiness to deploy to the region as it warned Iran against
expanding the ongoing conflict. </p>
<p>The announcement came two days after President Joe Biden directed the
Pentagon to adjust U.S. force posture in the Middle East amid
intensifying concern that Israel’s killing of the leader of Iran-backed
Hezbollah could prompt Tehran to retaliate. </p>
<p>“The United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed
partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the
conflict,” Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder said in a
statement. </p>
<p>He also cautioned that if Iran or groups Tehran backs “use this
moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the
United States will take every necessary measure to defend our
people.” </p>
<p>The Pentagon statement offered few clues as to the size or scope of
the new air deployment, saying only that “we will further reinforce our
defensive air-support capabilities in the coming days.” </p>
<p>Israel struck more targets in Lebanon on Sunday, pressing Hezbollah
with new attacks after killing the group’s leader, Sayyed Hassan
Nasrallah, and a string of its other top commanders in an escalating
military campaign. </p>
<p>The strikes have dealt a stunning succession of blows to Hezbollah
after almost a year of cross-border fire, killing much of its leadership
and revealing gaping security holes. But it has also raised questions
about Washington’s publicly declared goals of containing the conflict
and safeguarding U.S. personnel throughout the Middle East. </p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Sunday
that the United States is watching to see what Hezbollah does to try to
fill its leadership vacuum, “and is continuing to talk to the Israelis
about what the right next steps are.” </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has yet to order an evacuation from
Lebanon. But last week, U.S. officials told Reuters the Pentagon was
sending a few dozen additional troops to Cyprus to help the military
prepare for scenarios including an evacuation of Americans from
Lebanon. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said U.S. forces were being made ready to deploy, if
needed.  </p>
<p>“[Austin] increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to
deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,”
Ryder said in a statement.</p>

airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist
groups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic
State group and an al-Qaida-linked group were killed in two strikes, the
United States military said Sunday. </p>
<p>Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday,
targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaida-linked Hurras al-Deen
group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing
military operations. </p>
<p>They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16,
where they conducted a “large-scale airstrike” on an IS training camp in
a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28
militants, including “at least four Syrian leaders.” </p>
<p>“The airstrike will disrupt ISIS’ capability to conduct operations
against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,” the
statement read. </p>
<p>There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed
number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the
extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking
control of large swaths of territory. </p>
<p>U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria,
the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic
areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key
border crossing with Iraq.</p>

suicides in 2023 still at highest level in nation’s history, says
data</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — U.S. suicides last year remained at about the highest
level in the nation’s history, preliminary data suggests. </p>
<p>A little more than 49,300 suicide deaths were reported in 2023,
according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. That number that could grow a little as some death
investigations are wrapped up and reported. </p>
<p>Just under 49,500 were reported in 2022, according to final data
released Thursday. The numbers are close enough that the suicide rate
for the two years are the same, CDC officials said. </p>
<p>U.S. suicide rates have been rising for nearly 20 years, aside from a
two-year drop around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. So “a
leveling off of any increase in suicide is cautiously promising news,”
said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who
studies suicide. </p>
<p>Indeed, there’s reason for optimism. A 2-year-old national crisis
line allows anyone in the U.S. to dial 988 to reach mental health
specialists. That and other efforts may be starting to pay off, Keyes
said, but it “really remains to be seen.” </p>
<p>Experts caution that suicide — the nation’s 11th-leading cause of
death in 2022 — is complicated and that attempts can be driven by a
range of factors. Contributors include higher rates of depression,
limited availability of mental health services, and the availability of
guns. About 55% of all suicide deaths in 2022 involved firearms,
according to CDC data. </p>
<p>The CDC’s Thursday report said: </p>
<p>—Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10–14
and 20–34, and the third-leading cause for people ages 15–19. </p>
<p>—Deaths continue to be more common among boys and men than girls and
women. The highest suicide rate for any group — by far — was in men ages
75 and older, at about 44 suicides per 100,000 men that age. </p>
<p>—Among women, the highest rate was in those who were middle-aged,
about 9 per 100,000. But more dramatic increases have been seen in teens
and young women, with the rate for that group doubling in the last two
decades. </p>
<p>—The overall suicide rate in 2022 and 2023 was 14.2 per 100,000. It
also was that high in 2018. Before then, it hadn’t been that high since
1941.</p>

<h2 id="in-us-its-time-to-roll-up-sleeves-for-new-covid-flu-shots">In
US, it’s time to roll up sleeves for new COVID, flu shots</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Fall means it’s time for just about everybody to get up
to date on their flu and COVID-19 vaccines – and a lot of older adults
also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don’t
call them boosters — they’re not just another dose of last year’s
protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that
constantly mutate to evade your body’s immune defenses, so both vaccines
are reformulated annually to target newer strains.</p>
<p>“Right now is the best time” to get all the recommended fall
vaccinations, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, as she got her flu shot Wednesday. She has an
appointment for her COVID-19 shot, too. It’s “the single most effective
thing you can do to protect yourself, your family, your community.”</p>
<p>While they’re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection
against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 — or dying from it.</p>
<p>“It may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to
be less severe,” said CDC’s Dr. Demetre Daskalakis. “I would rather have
my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to
the emergency room on Thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>The challenge: Getting more Americans to roll up their sleeves. Last
year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got
a COVID-19 shot. A survey released Wednesday by the National Foundation
for Infectious Diseases shows an equally low number intend to this
fall.</p>
<p>And the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last
year.</p>
<p>“Maybe we believe that it’s not going to be me but let’s not take a
chance,” said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. “Why
not get a vaccine that’s going to help you reduce that risk?”</p>
<p>Who needs a fall COVID-19 or flu vaccination?</p>
<p>The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine
for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you
can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination
because of the expected winter surge.</p>
<p>Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including
older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart
disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199
child deaths from flu last year.</p>
<p>Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu – and
vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection,
too.</p>
<p>What’s new about the COVID-19 shots?</p>
<p>Last fall’s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that’s no longer
spreading while this year’s are tailored to a new section of the
coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated
against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets
its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross
protection to other subtypes now spreading.</p>
<p>The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and
children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional
protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12
and older.</p>
<p>Which flu vaccine to choose?</p>
<p>High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed
for people 65 and older, but if they can’t find one easily they can
choose a regular all-ages flu shot.</p>
<p>For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2
to 49 at pharmacies and clinics — although next year it’s set to be
available for use at home.</p>
<p>All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu
strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu
quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.</p>
<p>What about that other virus, RSV?</p>
<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most
people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for
children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health
problems.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and
for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot,
not a yearly vaccination – but only 24% of seniors got it last year.
It’s also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during
the fall and winter.</p>
<p>And while “your arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,” it’s
also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time,
Daskalakis said.</p>
<p>What will it cost?</p>
<p>The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and
most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.</p>
<p>About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations
through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC
is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access –
and states and large cities are starting to roll out their plans.</p>
<p>Call your local health department to ask about options because in
many areas, “availability of vaccine at lower or no cost is expected to
trickle in over the next couple of weeks,” advised Dr. Raynard
Washington, who heads the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, health
department.</p>
<p>Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local
pharmacies.</p>

id="trump-lists-his-grievances-in-a-wisconsin-speech-intended-to-link-harris-to-illegal-immigration">Trump
lists his grievances in a Wisconsin speech intended to link Harris to
illegal immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump meandered
Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala
Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic
opponent to illegal border crossings.</p>
<p>A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border,
Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about
immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after
entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for “erasing
our border.”</p>
<p>“I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,” he said.
“We’re going to liberate the country.”</p>
<p>Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to
votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican
nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as
“poisoning the blood of the country” and vowed to stage the largest
deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show
Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling
immigration.</p>
<p>Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep
track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination
attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being
able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller
indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris’
father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden’s, and a
fly that was buzzing near him.</p>
<p>“I wonder where the fly came from,” he said. “Two years ago, I
wouldn’t have had a fly up here. You’re changing rapidly. But we can’t
take it any longer. We can’t take it any longer.”</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly brought up Harris’ Friday event in Douglas, Arizona,
where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond
Biden’s executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced
Trump’s handling of the border while president and his opposing a
bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump “prefers to
run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.”</p>
<p>“I had to sit there and listen” to Harris last night Trump said,
eliciting cheers. “And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be
allowed to put it on. It’s all lies. Everything she says is lies.”</p>
<p>The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against
Harris, insulting her as “mentally impaired” and a “disaster.”</p>
<p>Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he
was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his
administration, border agents separated children from their parents at
the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as
inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own
party.</p>
<p>Harris, at a rally in San Francisco, told supporters there were “two
very different visions for our nation” and voters see it “every day on
the campaign trail.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is the same old tired show,” she said. “The same tired
playbook we have heard for years.”</p>
<p>She said Trump was “a very unserious man.” “However, the consequences
of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious.”</p>
<p>At Trump’s event, on either side of the stage were poster-sized mug
shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including
Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel
Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the
country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not
just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on
September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and
domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment.</p>

launches rescue mission for 2 NASA astronauts stranded in space</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — SpaceX launched a rescue mission for the
two stuck astronauts at the International Space Station on Saturday,
sending up a downsized crew to bring them home but not until next
year. </p>
<p>The capsule rocketed into orbit to fetch the test pilots whose Boeing
spacecraft returned to Earth empty earlier this month because of safety
concerns. The switch in rides left it to NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s
Alexander Gorbunov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. </p>
<p>Because NASA rotates space station crews approximately every six
months, this newly launched flight with two empty seats reserved for
Wilmore and Williams won’t return until late February. Officials said
there wasn’t a way to bring them back earlier on SpaceX without
interrupting other scheduled missions. </p>
<p>By the time they return, the pair will have logged more than eight
months in space. They expected to be gone just a week when they signed
up for Boeing’s first astronaut flight that launched in June. </p>
<p>NASA ultimately decided that Boeing’s Starliner was too risky after a
cascade of thruster troubles and helium leaks marred its trip to the
orbiting complex. The space agency cut two astronauts from this SpaceX
launch to make room on the Dragon capsule’s return leg for Wilmore and
Williams. </p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams watched the liftoff via a live link sent to the
space station, prompting a cheer of “Go Dragon!” from Williams, NASA
deputy program manager Dina Contella said. </p>
<p>Williams has been promoted to commander of the space station, which
will soon be back to its normal population of seven. Once Hague and
Gorbunov arrive Sunday, four astronauts living there since March can
leave in their own SpaceX capsule. Their homecoming was delayed a month
by Starliner’s turmoil. </p>
<p>Hague noted before the flight that change is the one constant in
human spaceflight. </p>
<p>“There’s always something that is changing. Maybe this time it’s been
a little more visible to the public,” he said. </p>
<p>Hague was thrust into the commander’s job for the rescue mission
based on his experience and handling of a launch emergency six years
ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly after liftoff, and the capsule
carrying him and a cosmonaut catapulted off the top to safety. </p>
<p>Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier Stephanie
Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA opted to go with SpaceX
to bring the stuck astronauts home. Promised a future space mission,
both were at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, taking part in the launch
livestream. Gorbunov remained on the flight under an exchange agreement
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. </p>
<p>“Every crewed launch that I have ever watched has really brought me a
lot of emotion. This one today was especially unique,” a teary-eyed
Cardman said following the early afternoon liftoff. “It was hard not to
watch that rocket lift off without thinking, ‘That’s my rocket and
that’s my crew.’” </p>
<p>Moments before liftoff, Hague paid tribute to his two colleagues left
behind: “Unbreakable. We did it together.” Once in orbit, he called it a
“sweet ride” and thanked everyone who made it possible. </p>
<p>Earlier, Hague acknowledged the challenges of launching with half a
crew and returning with two astronauts trained on another
spacecraft. </p>
<p>“We’ve got a dynamic challenge ahead of us,” Hague said after
arriving from Houston last weekend. “We know each other and we’re
professionals and we step up and do what’s asked of us.” </p>
<p>SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA’s commercial crew program,
established as the space shuttles were retiring more than a decade ago.
SpaceX beat Boeing in delivering astronauts to the space station in
2020, and it is now up to 10 crew flights for NASA. </p>
<p>Boeing has struggled with a variety of issues over the years,
repeating a Starliner test flight with no one on board after the first
one veered off course. The Starliner that left Wilmore and Williams in
space landed without any issues in the New Mexico desert on September 6,
and has since returned to Kennedy Space Center. A week ago, Boeing’s
defense and space chief was replaced. </p>
<p>Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the latest SpaceX
liftoff marked the first for astronauts from Launch Complex 40 at Cape
Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad
nearly two decades ago and used it for satellite and station cargo
launches, while flying crews from Kennedy’s former Apollo and shuttle
pad next door. The company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon
rockets soared.</p>

<p>I’m blown away by NotebookLM. It seems there’s nothing too hard to
learn when you can get a podcast-style overview and then ask any
question in an interactive learning session. So let’s think big; why
can’t my 8 year old child learn about cutting edge PhD research? How far
can we get?</p>
