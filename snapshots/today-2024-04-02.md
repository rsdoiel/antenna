Muyao Shen explains the concept of the Left Curve in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves"><i>The Big Winners of This Crypto Bull Market Are the `Left Curves’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.”<br />
<br />
The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little, and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything.

Why does Shen think those who know nothing about cryptocurrencies are the big winners? Because they are jumping in to yet another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">cruptocurrency bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, a crypto project with pseudonymous co-founders including “Smokey The Bera” and “Dev Bear” has become a unicorn after it raised millions of dollars from institutional investors such as Brevan Howard Digital. Another token with no real utility — only a cute picture of a dog wearing a hat — has increased by more than 1,400 times its value from three months ago. A developer of a sloth-themed memecoin called Slerf claimed they accidentally burned a large amount of the tokens after raising $10 million.<br />
<br />
What a great time to be a left curve! In this bull market, forget about highbrow ideas like revamping Wall Street. Give up on dreams of replacing traditional artwork with nonfungible tokens. Instead, don’t overthink it. Just “<a href="https://twitter.com/allnick/status/1770093646768976229">choose rich</a>.”

Well, yes, but the much-desired <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/desperately-seeking-retail.html">retail traders</a> don't seem convinced. Even the mania around spot Bitcoin ETS has died down, as the chart shows. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">Shen writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How did this happen? How did crypto’s greatest comeback take place so fast, so hilariously and — at times — so stupidly? Why did crypto evangelists give up their dreams? At its core, it’s because the market is still living under the shadows of past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup.<br />
<br />
In the past bull markets, when Bitcoin went up, everything else went up amid small-scale rotations between major and small-cap coins. But in this bull market, the rotation is more severe: As Solana went up in the past month, the price of Ether went down dramatically — a simple piece of evidence that shows there’s less money being thrown at the crypto market today than three years ago.
</blockquote>
The "past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup" may be old news but to their victims they aren't even close to over. The best FTX's creditors can hope for is to get back what their HODL-ings were worth <i>before</i> Bitcoin took off moon-wards, and who knows when that might happen.<br />
<br />
Kevin T. Dugan's <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html"><i>The Crypto World Has a New Villain</i></a> starts with the story of one victim of yet another "past catastrophe":<br />
<blockquote>
"I had no idea who Barry Silbert was or anything until after November 16, 2022," Eric Asquith told me. That date was when he was pretty sure he had lost his family’s savings of $1,052,000.
</blockquote>
Asquith wasn't on the Left Curve but just a bit <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">left of the middle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He didn’t buy bitcoin or other meme tokens. Instead, earlier that year, he moved over cash from his business — just a little at first, then more — and converted it into digital currencies he thought were as good as cash. The digital coins were called GUSD, and each was worth exactly $1 because the company that minted them — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/how-the-winkleviis-second-act-in-bitcoin-went-bad.html">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s crypto exchange, Gemini</a> — backed each one with real money and assets.
</blockquote>
But Asquith's GUSD were deposited into Gemini's Earn program to get its 5.5% interest, far more than banks were paying. But Asquith and the other Earn depositors were far enough left on the curve that they didn't know Earn <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">wasn't like a bank savings account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
What Asquith did not fully understand was that his money was no longer with Gemini. In one sense, Genesis, a crypto company owned by Barry Silbert had it, but even that wasn’t quite true. Soon-to-collapse hedge funds with names like Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research — Sam Bankman-Fried’s personal fund — were quietly borrowing from Silbert’s shop. Asquith’s money, and that of tens of thousands of others, was being used by SBF and others to make giant bets on some of the highest-flying, most volatile digital tokens.
</blockquote>
Then Terra/Luna collapsed and things started to fall apart. Amy Castor and David Gerard <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/11/25/crypto-collapse-ftx-first-day-hearing-genesis-screws-dcg-silvergate-bank/">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of Genesis’s biggest customers was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), who they’d lent $2.4 billion. After 3AC blew up in May, DCG assumed $1.2 billion of the liabilities to keep the hit off Genesis’ books. Genesis had been the single largest creditor of 3AC.<br />
<br />
Genesis also had money on FTX. As FTX was falling apart, Genesis tweeted on November 8 that they had no exposure, and it was fine. Two days later, Genesis admitted they had “~$175M in locked funds in our FTX trading account,” and they were not fine.<br />
<br />
Genesis scrambled to find more capital. Genesis and DCG needed $1 billion in emergency credit by 10 a.m. EST on November 14, but didn’t get it. Even Binance turned them down.<br />
<br />
So two days later, Genesis suspended withdrawals,<br />
...<br />
One of Genesis’s biggest customers is Gemini Trust, run by the Winklevoss twins, that operated its own “yield” program, Gemini Earn, for retail investors.<br />
<br />
Gemini was supposed to be the safe exchange — but it was exposed to risks via Genesis. There’s now $700 million that Gemini Earn customers can’t withdraw — because it’s stuck on Genesis.
</blockquote>
Gemini <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/01/12/crypto-collapse-dcgs-check-kiting-comes-home-to-roost-nexo-raided-voyager-sale-to-binance-progresses-unbanking-the-banked/">tried to get the cash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On January 8, Gemini terminated the Master Loan Agreement with Genesis and emailed customers accordingly. This “requires Genesis to return all outstanding assets in the program.” Genesis did not return the funds by the end of January 10 — so they were officially in default on the loan. At this point, Genesis can pull the pin and try to put Gemini into involuntary bankruptcy.
</blockquote>
They did, and there followed a year of legal wrangling between Gemini, Genesis and Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis. The <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/01/13/sec-sues-genesis-and-gemini-genesis-owes-3-billion-to-creditors/">SEC sued both Gemini and Genesis</a>, and so did <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">the New York Attorney General</a>.
While the wrangling continued, another of the semi-regular cryptocurrency bull markets took off until <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">in February 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the victims, Silbert’s now-bankrupt crypto-lending operation, the Winklevoss twins, and regulators hammered out a deal to pay everybody back in full. The crypto bull market of 2024 made it possible to pay back Earn customers not some fraction of what they invested but the generally much higher sum of what their holdings would now be worth.
</blockquote>
Everyone started <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">cele:wbrating</a>;<br />
<blockquote>
Except there was Silbert. Earn victims who had been unfamiliar with him would soon learn that he had made his first fortune by studying the ins and outs of the bankruptcy system and using it to his financial advantage. Since February, the billionaire investor has been relying on a controversial interpretation of bankruptcy law to stop Asquith and all the other victims from getting the bigger payout, the one based on current prices. Instead, to simplify a bit, he would prefer to keep that money himself. “DCG cannot support a plan that not only deprives DCG of its corporate governance rights but also violates United States bankruptcy code,” a spokeswoman for the company said.<br />
<br />
The victims have taken to calling it “the Barry Trade”: If Silbert is successful, he would be able to pocket as much as $1 billion in funds that would otherwise be returned to them. At the very least, Silbert may substantially delay the money being returned to Earn customers.<br />
...<br />
Silbert’s legal logic is that the bankruptcy code sets a date to value victims’ claims in U.S. dollars, and in Genesis’ case, it just happened to be around the market’s lows. 
</blockquote>
People started <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-twins-crypto-firms-charged-by-sec">talking to the press about Gemini</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Former Gemini employees told The Beast that Gemini Earn’s terms and conditions were highly dubious from the outset. One staffer recalled reading the fine print for the first time, saying, “[We] were like, ‘Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?’”<br />
<br />
Among those terms: Customer assets were loaned out on “an unsecured basis,” which meant that their money would not be safe in the event of a market collapse. The deposits were also not insured, nor were they guaranteed against errors or fraudulent activity.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">And Genesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Whatever Gemini may or may not have done pales in comparison to what you see at Genesis, which was more than negligent when it came to protecting customer assets and complying with general best practices,” one former employee said. Among those problems, the person said, was not screening clients who were on, say, the Treasury’s blacklists — an allegation that was supported by a separate January suit filed by New York Department of Financial Services.
</blockquote>
This isn't a "past catastrophe". For the victims <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">there is no end in sight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A ruling isn’t expected until April. Since the settlement announcement, the victims have resigned themselves to an even longer wait as Silbert continues to fight. “A year ago, there was a deal that was proposed. Everyone was celebrating in a very similar way,” Asquith said. “Now, I’ll believe it when it’s in my account.”
</blockquote>
This case, like Dickens' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce">Jarndyce v Jarndyce</a>, will run and run.<br />

<p>The yield on 10-year Treasury notes ticked up sharply to 4.4% this morning, and the thought of extended higher interest rates has stock investors in a cautious mood. We&#8217;ll discuss. Then, Google is promising to delete mountains of data following a class-action lawsuit. And it was last call for one of the oldest casinos on the Las Vegas strip this morning. We&#8217;ll took a look back at the history of the Tropicana.</p>

## First vessel uses alternate channel to bypass wreckage at Baltimore bridge collapse site

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

Baltimore — A tugboat pushing a fuel barge was the first vessel to use an alternate channel to bypass the wreckage of Baltimore's collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, which had blocked traffic along the vital port's main shipping channel.


The barge supplying jet fuel to the Department of Defense left late Monday and was destined for Delaware's Dover Air Force Base, though officials have said the temporary channel is open primarily to vessels that are helping with the cleanup effort. Some barges and tugs that have been stuck in the Port of Baltimore since the collapse are also scheduled to pass through the channel. 


Officials said they're working on a second channel on the southwest side of the main channel that will allow for deeper draft vessels, but they didn't say when that might open. 


Gov. Wes Moore is set Tuesday to visit one of two centers that the Small Business Administration opened in the area to help companies get loans to assist them with losses caused by the disruption of the bridge collapse. 




Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and concrete at the site of the bridge's deadly collapse after a container ship lost power and crashed into a supporting column. On Sunday, dive teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked the ship, and workers in lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of the twisted steel superstructure. 


Authorities believe six workers plunged to their deaths in the collapse, including two whose bodies were recovered last week. Two other workers survived. 




Moore, a Democrat, said at a Monday afternoon news conference that his top priority is recovering the four remaining bodies, followed by reopening shipping channels. He said that he understands the urgency but that the risks are significant. Crews have described the mangled steel girders of the fallen bridge as "chaotic wreckage," he said. 


"What we're finding is it is more complicated than we hoped for initially," said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath. 


Meanwhile, the ship remains stationary, and its 21 crew members remain on board for now, officials said. 


President Joe Biden is expected to visit the collapse site Friday to meet with state and local officials and get at federal response efforts. 


The bridge fell as the cargo ship Dali lost power March 26 shortly after leaving Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka. The ship issued a mayday alert, which allowed just enough time for police to stop traffic, but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes on the bridge. 




The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd., both of Singapore. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali. 


Synergy and Grace Ocean filed a court petition Monday seeking to limit their legal liability, a routine but important procedure for cases litigated under U.S. maritime law. A federal court in Maryland will ultimately decide who is responsible and how much they owe. 


The filing seeks to cap the companies' liability at roughly $43.6 million. It estimates that the vessel itself is valued at up to $90 million and was owed over $1.1 million in income from freight. The estimate also deducts two major expenses: at least $28 million in repair costs and at least $19.5 million in salvage costs. 


Officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge, which was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast Baltimore and became a symbol of the city's working-class roots and maritime culture. 


Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other U.S. facility.

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. It’s a big week for EV sales numbers</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Major U.S. electric vehicle manufacturers including Tesla and Rivian are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c154cb693c&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">expected</a> to report on their first-quarter sales and deliveries this week. Expectations for Tesla are pretty low, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=16db2f86e1&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>, with analysts forecasting global deliveries of about 449,080 vehicles, down 7%. “Some on Wall Street are even braced for Tesla’s first sales decline since the early days of the pandemic.” But hey, Tesla might win back its title of “biggest EV seller” after Chinese rival BYD <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ddf1a69307&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> a 43% drop in quarterly sales. Analysts expect Rivian to deliver 16,608 vehicles, up 18.9% over Q4 of 2023. Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, GM, and Honda will also release Q1 reports this week, so stay tuned.
</p><h3>2. Shell fights ‘mother of all climate cases’ in The Hague</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Fossil fuel giant Shell is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4aa8df6ba4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arguing</a> in The Hague this week that a landmark emissions ruling was legally defunct. In 2021, a district court <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=68032932b8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled in favor</a> of environmental group Friends of the Earth Netherlands and ordered Shell to cut its greenhouse gas emissions (including scope 3 emissions) by 45% by 2030. “This was the mother of all climate cases against corporations” because it opened the door to copycat cases, Klaas Hendrik Eller, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam’s center for transformative private law, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d0393c9c2f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. Shell is appealing, insisting the order lacks legal basis and that companies cannot be held responsible for their clients’ emissions. Friends of the Earth will argue that the scientific evidence shows burning fossil fuels is causing global warming and that “Shell has a responsibility to act in accordance with climate science and international climate agreements.” A ruling is expected in the second half of this year.

The region is suffering from intense drought driven by human-caused climate change and the El Niño weather pattern. Researchers are worried these fires are a sign of things to come. “Everything is indicating we’re going to see other events of catastrophic fires – megafires that are huge in size and height,” Manoela Machado, a fire researcher at University of Oxford, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=78aa7acb1d&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a>. More than half of all the fires burning in the Amazon rainforest are located in Venezuela.
</p><h3>4. Human case of bird flu found in Texas</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A case of avian flu has been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=345b1fc404&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detected</a> in a human in Texas, marking the first such case since the virus was recently identified in cows across several states, and only the second case in U.S. history. The current outbreak of H5N1 has decimated bird populations across the world and also spread to mammals, including seals, mink, and now cows. Health experts worry the virus could mutate to become easily transmissible between humans, but so far there is no evidence of that happening. Still, “every single time is a little bit of Russian roulette,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9adc576321&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Ashish Jha, who led the Biden administration’s pandemic response. “You play that game long enough and one of these times it will become fit to spread among humans.” Researchers <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0b87a7caee&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> climate change is altering birds’ breeding habits and migratory patterns in ways that leave them <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=023050554a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more vulnerable</a> to bird flu.
</p><h3>5. In Europe, solar panels are the new garden fencing</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The price of solar panels has dropped so significantly that some households in Europe are using them as fencing in their yards, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=97c803ac21&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>. Skyrocketing production out of China means solar panels are cheap and getting cheaper. But at the same time, installation costs for rooftop solar remain high, prompting some DIY-minded homeowners to roll up their sleeves and install panels as fencing. The panels don’t get quite as much sun as they would on a rooftop, but they still work. No word on what the neighbors have to say about it. Peculiar garden aesthetics aside, the solar glut has “brought Europe's solar makers to their knees,” <em>Politico</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dfd1d66a3e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> recently. Manufacturers want the European Commission to step in and help them. In the U.S., the cost of a solar panel is now half of what it was last year, and falling.

## Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma

date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News

Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools joke, but of course, there&#8217;s still the very real possibility we&#8217;re being led on here. Still, I&#8217;m taking the risk and treating this as a serious change proposal for Fedora, even though it&#8217;s likely to cause some controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR, VRR, and more, and it&#8217;s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be accepted, it&#8217;s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be &#8216;upgraded&#8217; to KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I would personally support this change, it&#8217;s pretty much 100% unlikely this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that&#8217;s misguided when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today, that&#8217;s not going to change. Still, it&#8217;s an interesting discussion point, if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper than people seem to think.

## 2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?

<h1 id="2024-03-27-sick-or-hayfever">2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?</h1>

<p>Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the frontal sinus cavity, ouch.</p>

<p>But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what is it?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Zürich is super dark red.)</p>

<p>The report says:</p>

<p>“Eschen und Birken blühen frühzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und für deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren Lagen mässige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.”</p>

<p>Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.</p>

<p>I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed.
Hopefully at least one of these things will help.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Hayfever">#Hayfever</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-03-28</strong>. Ugh. Staying in bed.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-29</strong>. Definitely sick. 🤒</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-30</strong>. Still sick, but the fever is gone. Perhaps now it’s just the hayfever?</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-31</strong>. Left the house for <a href="2024-03-31-flowers">a walk</a> with Claudia and a friend that lives nearby.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-01</strong>. Actually spent some time at the laptop. I guess turnaround cautiously confirmed?</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-02</strong>. Recovery is on track. Falling asleep was hard. Some nose blowing still. Not sure about focus. It’s good enough for an hour or so? Back to bed now. I hope to be back on my feet tomorrow!</p>

## Person is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in Texas

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows, health officials said Monday.


The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low. 


It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.


However, there’s no evidence of person-to-person spread or that anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


Genetic tests don’t suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current antiviral medications still seem to work, he added.


Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu — and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah said.


Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species – including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises – in scores of countries. 


However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an “unexpected and problematic twist,” said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public health college.


This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. 


Most infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have been on guard for any sign of spread among people. 


Texas officials didn’t identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows.


The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms. Roughly a dozen people in Texas who did have symptoms were tested in connection with the dairy cow infections, but only the one person came back positive, Shah said.


It's only the second time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what’s known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

On Tuesday, March 26, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over Trump&#8217;s election interference case, put Trump under a gag order to stop his attacks on court staff, prosecutors, jurors, and witnesses. On Wednesday, Trump renewed his attacks on the judge and the judge&#8217;s daughter. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton took the unusual step of talking publicly about what threats of violence meant to the rule of law. Walton, who was appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush, told Kaitlan Collins of CNN that threats, especially threats to a judge&#8217;s family, undermine the ability of judges to carry out their duties.

## Overwhelming majority of Ukraine supplemental funding spent inside US

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Congress left Washington for a break without deciding on a supplemental funding bill to arm Ukraine and other allies. Republicans who oppose the funding say Congress should spend its money on domestic concerns, but as VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb reports, the funding bill hits closer to home than many Americans may realize.

## US, Britain announce partnership on AI safety, testing

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States and Britain on Monday announced a new partnership on the science of artificial intelligence safety, amid growing concerns about upcoming next-generation versions.


Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and British Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington to jointly develop advanced AI model testing, following commitments announced at an AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park in November.


"We all know AI is the defining technology of our generation," Raimondo said. "This partnership will accelerate both of our institutes work across the full spectrum to address the risks of our national security concerns and the concerns of our broader society."


Britain and the United States are among countries establishing government-led AI safety institutes.


Britain said in October its institute would examine and test new types of AI, while the United States said in November it was launching its own safety institute to evaluate risks from so-called frontier AI models and is now working with 200 companies and entites.


Under the formal partnership, Britain and the United States plan to perform at least one joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible model and are considering exploring personnel exchanges between the institutes. Both are working to develop similar partnerships with other countries to promote AI safety.


"This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world," Donelan said. "AI is already an extraordinary force for good in our society and has vast potential to tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, but only if we are able to grip those risks."


Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts, has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans and catastrophic effects.


In a joint interview with Reuters Monday, Raimondo and Donelan urgent joint action was needed to address AI risks.


"Time is of the essence because the next set of models are about to be released, which will be much, much more capable," Donelan said. "We have a focus one the areas that we are dividing and conquering and really specializing."


Raimondo said she would raise AI issues at a meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council in Belgium Thursday.


The Biden administration plans to soon announce additions to its AI team, Raimondo said. "We are pulling in the full resources of the U.S. government."


Both countries plan to share key information on capabilities and risks associated with AI models and systems and technical research on AI safety and security.


In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.


Britain said in February it would spend more than 100 million pounds ($125.5 million) to launch nine new research hubs and AI train regulators about the technology.


Raimondo said she was especially concerned about the threat of AI applied to bioterrorism or a nuclear war simulation.


"Those are the things where the consequences could be catastrophic and so we really have to have zero tolerance for some of these models being used for that capability," she said.

## Judge expands gag order after Trump's social media posts about judge's daughter

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The judge in Donald Trump's hush-money criminal case expanded the former president's gag order Monday after the former president assailed the judge's daughter and made a false claim about her on social media last week.


Judge Juan M. Merchan said his original gag order issued last Tuesday did not include members of his family, but Trump's subsequent actions warranted including them.


Merchan's daughter, Loren Merchan, is a Democratic political consultant. Prosecutors had urged Merchan to clarify or expand his gag order after Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Loren Merchan "makes money by working to 'Get Trump,'" and wrongly accused her of posting a social media photo showing him behind bars.


The trial, which involves allegations Trump falsified payment records in a scheme to cover up negative stories during his 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to begin April 15. Trump denies wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.


Trump's lawyers had fought the gag order and its expansion, arguing that Trump was engaging in protected political campaign speech.

## Last survivor of USS Arizona from Pearl Harbor attack, dies at 102

date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA

honolulu — Lou Conter, the last living survivor of the USS Arizona battleship that exploded and sank during the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 102.


Conter passed away Monday at his home in Grass Valley, California, following congestive heart failure, his daughter, Louann Daley said, adding she was beside him along with two of her brothers, James and Jeff.


The Arizona lost 1,177 sailors and Marines in the 1941 attack that launched the United States into World War II. The battleship’s dead account for nearly half of those killed in the attack.


Conter was a quartermaster, standing on the main deck of the Arizona as Japanese planes flew overhead at 7:55 a.m. on December 7 that year. Sailors were just beginning to hoist colors or raise the flag when the assault began.


Conter recalled how one bomb penetrated steel decks 13 minutes into the battle and set off more than 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of gunpowder stored below. The explosion lifted the battleship 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) out of the water, he said during a 2008 oral history interview stored at the Library of Congress. Everything was on fire from the mainmast forward, he said.


“Guys were running out of the fire and trying to jump over the sides,” Conter said. “Oil all over the sea was burning.”


His autobiography The Lou Conter Story recounts how he joined other survivors tending to the injured, many of them blinded and badly burned. The sailors only abandoned ship when their senior surviving officer was sure they had rescued all those still alive.




The rusting wreckage of the Arizona still lies where it sank. More than 900 sailors and Marines remain entombed inside. Only 335 Arizona crew members survived.


Conter went to flight school after Pearl Harbor, earning his wings to fly PBY patrol bombers, which the Navy used to look for submarines and bomb enemy targets. He flew 200 combat missions in the Pacific with a “Black Cats” squadron, which conducted dive bombing at night in planes painted black.


In 1943, he and his crew were shot down in waters near New Guinea and had to avoid sharks. A sailor expressed doubt they would survive, to which Conter replied, “baloney.”


“Don’t ever panic in any situation. Survive is the first thing you tell them. Don’t panic or you’re dead,” he said. They were quiet and treaded water until another plane came hours later and dropped a lifeboat on them.


In the late 1950s, he was made the Navy’s first SERE officer — an acronym for survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He spent the next decade training Navy pilots and crew on how to survive if they’re shot down in the jungle and captured as a prisoner of war. Some of his pupils used his lessons as POWs in Vietnam.


Conter retired in 1967 after 28 years in the Navy.


Conter was born in Ojibwa, Wisconsin, on Sept. 13, 1921. His family later moved to Colorado. He enlisted in the Navy after he turned 18, getting $17 a month and a hammock for his bunk at boot camp.


With Conter's death, there are now 19 survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack still living, according to Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. About 87,000 military personnel were on Oahu on Dec. 7, according to a rough estimate compiled by military historian J. Michael Wenger.


In his later years, Conter became a fixture at annual remembrance ceremonies in Pearl Harbor that the Navy and the National Park Service jointly hosted on the anniversaries of the 1941 attack. When he lacked the strength to attend in person, he recorded video messages for those who gathered and watched remotely from his home in California.


In 2019, when he was 98, he said he liked going to such events, to remember those who lost their lives.


“It’s always good to come back and pay respect to them and give them the top honors that they deserve,” he said.

## LiveWire S2 Mulholland test ride: electric cruiser from the future

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/livewire-s2-mulholland.webp?w=1600" /></div><p>Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire company unveiled its third electric motorcycle in March: the S2 Mulholland. At first glance, the electric cruiser closely resembles the existing LiveWire S2 Del Mar. That’s thanks to the shared Arrow platform fulfilling its purpose of spanning multiple electric motorbikes.</p>



<p>Still, there are a number of key differences between the S2 models that make these two distinct bikes. While we’ll have to wait for an extensive review, I recently completed a LiveWire S2 Mulholland test ride and have some initial impressions.</p>

## GCC 10 ported to QNX 6.5 SP1

date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News

Way back in the day, back when I wasn&#8217;t even working at OSNews yet, I used to run QNX as my desktop operating system, together with a small number of other enthusiasts. It was a struggle, for sure, but it was fun, exciting, and nobody else was crazy enough to do so. Sadly, the small QNX desktop community wasn&#8217;t even remotely interesting to QNX, and later Blackberry when they acquired the company, and eventually the stand-alone Neutrino-powered version of QNX disappeared behind confusing signup screens and other dark patterns. It meant the end of our small little community. Much to my utter surprise and delight, I saw a post by js about how he ported GCC 10 to QNX &#8211; in this case, to QNX 6.5 SP1, released in 2012 &#8211; and submitted it to pkgsrc. His ultimate goal is to port one of his other projects, ObjFW, to QNX. He makes use of pkgsrc to do this kind of work, which also means he had to make pkgsrc bootstrap and a lot of other software work on QNX. We&#8217;re at QNX 8.0 by now, and as much as I bang my head against QNX and BlackBerry&#8217;s wall of marketing and corporate speak, I just can&#8217;t find out if it&#8217;s even still possible to download QNX Neutrino and install it on real generic hardware today.

## 2024-04-01 What’s the plan?

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org">@Shufei</a> asks what we&rsquo;ll do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it&rsquo;s worth imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps. So, assuming we make it, what happened?</p>

<p>I think the long term change we would need is extremely high taxes as a an explicit redistribution mechanism. We&rsquo;ll look back and say, &ldquo;during Late State Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to curb inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax bracket to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.</p>

## US not moved by report blaming Russia for ‘Havana Syndrome’

date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States is backing a year-old intelligence assessment that health problems affecting, and in some cases incapacitating, hundreds of American personnel around the world are not the result of a weapon wielded by a U.S. adversary.


The White House, the Pentagon and the State Department Monday stood by a March 2023 report by the National Intelligence Council that concluded it is “very unlikely” the adverse symptoms known as Havana Syndrome were caused by enemy operatives, despite a new investigation that suggests a notorious Russian intelligence unit may be to blame.


“The intelligence community has not concluded that,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, defending the conclusions of the 2023 assessment.




But Jean-Pierre also said the White House has not stopped looking at the issue, which in some cases has forced U.S. personnel to retire.


“We’ve taken this very seriously,” she said. “We are going to do everything that we can … We're going to continue to do a comprehensive examination of the effects here that we're seeing and the potential causes."


A joint investigation unveiled late Sunday by CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Germany’s Der Spiegel and The Insider, found there is reason to believe that the U.S. intelligence assessment came to the wrong conclusion.


Pointing to travel documents, mobile phone records, eyewitness testimony and interviews with multiple U.S. officials and victims, the news organizations concluded there is a high likelihood that Russia is to blame.


Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia’s military intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and assassinations.


It also found that many of the symptoms are consistent with the impact of sound or radio-frequency-based directed energy weapons.


Additionally, the investigation found members of GRU Unit 29155 received awards and promotions for their work on such weapons.


At the White House, Jean-Pierre referred additional questions about Havana Syndrome to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).


ODNI, the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, on Monday all declined to respond to VOA’s request for comment.


But both ODNI and DIA pointed to the Worldwide Threat Assessment issued by U.S. intelligence agencies last month.


“Most IC [intelligence community] agencies have concluded that it is very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs [anomalous health incidents],” the assessment said, using the U.S. government terminology for Havana Syndrome.


“IC agencies have varying confidence levels because we still have gaps given the challenges collecting on foreign adversaries — as we do on many issues involving them,” the assessment added, noting intelligence analysts continue to monitor developments “in areas we have identified as requiring additional research and analysis.”


U.S. officials have recorded about 1,500 cases of Havana Syndrome since staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, first reported unexplained illnesses in 2016. Victims in Cuba, Russia, China, Poland, Austria and even the United States have reported a variety of symptoms, including nausea and dizziness, debilitating headaches and memory problems.


An initial investigation pointed to the possibility that at least some of those suffering symptoms were impacted by some sort of weapon, findings that were supported by a 2022 report by a panel of experts.


"Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics," the 2022 report said.


But that same year, U.S. intelligence officials began backing off the hypothesis that the mystery ailments were the result of a weapon. The CIA, for example, said it appeared most of the cases could be "reasonably explained" by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors.


Russia on Monday rejected the conclusions of the investigation by CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Germany’s Der Spiegel, and The Insider.


“This is nothing more than a groundless accusation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia’s TASS news agency.


“This is not a new subject at all,” Peskov said. “From the very beginning it was somehow tied to accusing the Russian side of it but nobody has ever published or voiced any convincing support to these unfounded accusations.”


Still, there have been reports of new cases.


The Pentagon Monday confirmed one of them, involving a U.S. defense official who was struck with symptoms “similar to those reported in anomalous health incidents" during a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania last July.


Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters the individual was not part of the delegation attending the summit with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.


"I'm not aware that the secretary's delegation was at risk," Singh said, adding that Austin “has confidence in the intelligence community.”


As for the possibility that Russian agents, or those working for other U.S. adversaries, may be deploying a directed-energy weapon, "We'd always be concerned,” Singh said.


“We'd always be concerned of any type of impact to our servicemembers, to our civilians that causes health defects, health impacts,” she said in response to a question from VOA.


State Department officials Monday said there would be no repercussions for any employees speaking against the U.S. intelligence findings and noted those affected by Havana Syndrome have been given access to medical care and compensation through the HAVANA ACT, signed into law in 2021.




“The safety and security of our personnel remains the top priority of the secretary and we are doing everything possible to help those affected,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

## 2024-03-31 iPhone and iPad apps I use

date: 2024-04-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-31-iphone-and-ipad-apps-i-use">2024-03-31 iPhone and iPad apps I use</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Slowly recovering from the cold, I hope. I feel like I can write
again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really hate the feeling when I am looking for an app to do something
and I can&rsquo;t find a site that isn&rsquo;t about the top 10 something or
other. And then, by chance, somebody mentions a good app on fedi and
it&rsquo;s great. I guess I want to bring recommendation pages back.</p>

<p>I expect to be adding to this page.</p>

<p>What I won&rsquo;t be adding: The banking apps, the</p>

<h2 id="switzerland">Switzerland</h2>

<p>Now, there are some apps that are only interesting if you&rsquo;re in Switzerland:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB Mobile</a> is for the train tables and for buying tickets online. Basically a must-have if you don&rsquo;t have a car.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo-application">Swisstopo</a> is for the Swiss maps, my the Swiss <a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/">Federal Office of Topography</a>. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/switzerlandmobility-app">SwitzerlandMobility</a> is useful because it has the same official maps plus it interfaces with the Swiss Tourism site so all the big hiking tours have descriptions and pictures.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/about-us/get-our-app-and-stay-in-touch-with-switzerland/46766802">SWIplus</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/">swissinfo</a> site. No real benefit. News for the Swiss abroad, or conversely, for the foreigners staring back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.srf.ch/hilfe/website-und-apps/srf-apps">SRF News</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://www.srf.ch/news">SRF News</a> site. No real benefit, either. News</p>

<p><a href="">Play SRF</a> is the alternative to visiting the national <a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv">TV</a> or <a href="https://www.srf.ch/programm/radio/">Radio</a> sites. Useful if you want to look up older stuff. Or listen to an episode of Sounds! without subscribing to the podcast.</p>

<p>In the same vein, there&rsquo;s an app for <a href="https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/">Swiss Jazz</a>, <a href="https://www.radioswissclassic.ch/">Swiss Classic</a> and <a href="https://www.radioswisspop.ch/">Swiss Pop</a> – digital radio stations that just play music, by <a href="https://www.srgssr.ch/en/our-offering">SRG SSR</a>. That is to say, sponsored by the state.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/Swiss-Confederation-brief-guide.html">CH info</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://ch-info.swiss/">CH Info</a> site. No real benefit, again. Learn the absolute basics about Switzerland&rsquo;s political system, administration and judicial authorities – i.e., the Federal Administration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/abstimmungen/voteinfo.html">VoteInfo</a> is the alternative to reading all the news about all the elections, votes, referendums and initiatives, all in one place. Pretty interesting every handful of months.</p>

<p><strong>Compendium</strong> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://compendium.ch/">Compendium</a> site. No real benefit, I guess. Information about all the medication you can get in Switzerland. I hope you don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://osmand.net/">OsmAnd Maps Travel &amp; Navigate</a> is the Open Street Map (OSM) app that lets me download maps for offline use. Extremely useful for travelling abroad since Switzerland is not in the European Union and therefore roaming is extremely expensive for us and for foreigners in Switzerland… we need to be part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations">European Union roaming regulations</a>. The user interface is complex with different sets of settings depending on what you want to use the app for, and so it can be endlessly confusing at first. My wife hates it. Just be prepared for that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.peakfinder.com/">PeakFinder</a> is an app to identify mountain peaks. The older men here in Switzerland pride themselves in knowing all the peaks and the app is my only way of keeping up.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p><a href="https://icatcher.app/">iCatcher!</a> is my podcast app. A user interface that&rsquo;s easy to understand and it removes many ads. Great stuff! ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://brushedtype.co/doppler/">Doppler MP3 &amp; FLAC Player</a> is a music player for offline use. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Difegue/Stylophone?tab=readme-ov-file#stylophone">Stylophone</a> is a client for a <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">Music Player Daemon</a> (MPD) server running somewhere on your home network, connected to some speakers.
Before this app I used <a href="http://rbackhouse.github.io/MaximumMPD.html">MaximumMPD</a>. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/animoog">Animoog</a> is the synthesizer that got me spending a lot of time before going to bed doodling. So entrancing! ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/animoog-z">Animoog Z</a> is the follow-up app for the one above, but I haven&rsquo;t used it as much.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/minimoog-model-d-synthesizer-app">Minimoog Model D Synthesizer</a> is the emulation of a popular synthesizer and it is the one that made me buy actual Moog synthesizer hardware, later. ❤️</p>

<p>All this Moog music app fiddling did pay off for them. I bought a DFAM, Subharmonicon, Matriarch and Theremin from Moog…</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/model-15-modular-synthesizer-app">Model 15</a> is the emulation of their modular system, which isn&rsquo;t Eurorack so I won&rsquo;t ever buy anything about it. But I did like their tutorial!</p>

<p><a href="https://klankwelle.com/">Klankwelle</a> is a bare bones looking modular synthesizer. It comes with an <a href="https://klankwelle.com/tutorial_simple.html">online tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://audiokitpro.com/synth/">AudioKit Synth One</a> is a synthesizer that doesn&rsquo;t emulate anything. The people behind this one have a whole range of related apps that I own but don&rsquo;t actually use that much: <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/retropiano/">Retro Piano</a>, <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/bass808/">Bass 808</a>, <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/analog909/">909 Drums</a>, <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/kingfm/">King of FM</a>, <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/digitald1/">Digital D1</a>, <a href="https://audiokitpro.com/fmplayer/">FM Player 2</a>. I think my main issue is that they&rsquo;re either too simple or too complicated for my use. Also, they make me want to buy a <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/synthesizers?type=208">Moog Subsequent 25</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/">GarageBand</a> is great for the World instruments to doodle before going to bed: Pipa, Erhu, Koto and Guzheng. My favourite is the Erhu. I don&rsquo;t use any of the gazillion other features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apesoft.it/ivcs3/">iVCS3</a> is an emulator of the VCS3, machine created in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff&rsquo;s EMS company. Apparently it was the first portable commercially available synthesizer. You can use the original manual to learn how to use it! ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://warmplace.ru/soft/pixitracker/">PixiTracker</a> is a tracker that&rsquo;s intuitive to use: edit patterns, arrange patterns into songs, load different sounds, it all works like a charm, and it looks charming. ❤️</p>

<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>

<p>I used to be all about those weird retro cameras. I should have listened to the few that kept saying that people like me would regret this one day.</p>

<p>These days I just use the regular camera and sometimes I increase exposure or increase contrast and some cropping and that’s it.</p>

<h2 id="pictures">Pictures</h2>

<p><a href="https://procreate.com/">Procreate</a> seems to be the standard app. Everybody loves it. I don&rsquo;t know. I never got far with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://psoftmobile.net/en/zenbrush2.html">Zen Brush 2</a> and <a href="https://psoftmobile.net/en/zenbrush3.html">Zen Brush 3</a> are the apps that had me spend hours with the Apple pencil, drawing stuff. I love that this app tries really hard to do ink wash paintings or sumi-e and nothing else. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lofopi.com/art-set.html">Art Set</a> was the app that amazed me with the realistic looking oil colours. Amazing! But then I didn&rsquo;t draw much using the app.</p>

<h2 id="words">Words</h2>

<p><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> is the offline text editor I use when I need one. I rarely do, though.</p>

<h2 id="japanese">Japanese</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.rusche.ch/hobby/apps/">Kanji Teacher</a> is an app to learn Japanese Kanji by a friend of mine.
Check out the manual (<a href="https://www.rusche.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanji_teacher.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://www.rusche.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanji_teacher.epub">EPUB</a>).</p>

<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.floraincognita.de/">Flora Incognita</a> uses artificial intelligence to identify plants. I love it and take a ton of pictures with it. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin Bird ID</a> uses artificial intelligence to identify birds by song. I love it and use it a lot when out and about. ❤️</p>

<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/ios/">Firefox</a> is my browser. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-familiar-firefox-focus">Firefox Focus</a> is my default browser app so that links from elsewhere always open in there. It also acts as my content blocker for Safari (Settings → Safari → Extensions). ❤️</p>

<p><a href="http://forthworks.com:8800/iOS">Gopher</a> is Gopher client. Gopher is the real world wide web precursor. It&rsquo;s still around, and this is a client for it. I don&rsquo;t use it often.</p>

<p><a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> is a Gemini client. Gemini is a kind of retro alternative to the world wide web. Less features than the web but more features than Gopher. It feels like the very early web. It&rsquo;s full of nerds and nobody else. I don&rsquo;t use it often.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a> is an instant messenger that&rsquo;s free but tied to your phone number. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://threema.ch/">Threema</a> is an instant messenger that isn&rsquo;t free but gives you random accounts. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://delta.chat/">Delta Chat</a> looks like an instant messenger but uses encrypted email in the background.  ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a> is an IRC client that I no longer use. These days I have an installation of <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a> on a server of mine that I use via &ldquo;Add to Home Screen&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s always connected so I never miss a thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/toot-for-mastodon/id1229021451">Toot!</a> is a Mastodon client that works for any fedi server that implements the Mastodon Client Protocol. I use it with my GoToSocial server and it works great.  ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> is where I find my gaming buddies. I don&rsquo;t want to like it, but I was unable to find people elsewhere. So Discord it is. I even pay them money.</p>

## App Store Subscriptions and Family Sharing

date: 2024-04-01, from: Michael Tsai

Craig Hockenberry: Your code and the App Store don&#8217;t agree about when a subscription expired. The cause of this is Apple&#8217;s StoreKit sample code. It&#8217;s likely that you have some code similar to line 246 of Store.swift:subscriptionGroupStatus = try? await subscriptions.first?.subscription?.status.first?.stateThat code will work fine until you encounter a customer that has Family Sharing enabled, [&#8230;]

## America’s Best Idea, Now Accessible by EV

date: 2024-04-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg4Nzg5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDMzNTg0Nn0.S7e-7mG2WkXXSRjjP7Z5biys-5GNXbmcDyPvkkTP4cM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/essays/tesla-electric-car-road-trip-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closest</a> I came to battery oblivion happened in Bryce Canyon City, Utah. </p>
<p>Up above 7,600 feet, the December evening temperatures dipped to 10 below zero Fahrenheit as I pulled my Tesla Model 3 into Ruby’s Inn. Tesla’s website <a href="https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=38.19842904988786%2C-109.53559460907805%2C36.713741243174944%2C-113.3560902145468&zoom=9&filters=destination%20charger&location=409164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed</a> the hotel as a place with destination chargers that could refill the battery overnight. That guarantee did little good, since other EVs had snagged the few working plugs by the time we arrived. My car’s remaining range, suffering in the bitter cold, dropped below 20 miles as I scoured the sprawling hotel campus for other EV hookups the receptionist had marked on a paper map of the premises. </p>
<p>Finally, out in the middle of the snow, I saw the plug that was promised: a post with a single 120-volt outlet meant for the RVs that visit in sunnier months. My extension cord reached, barely. My battery would live through the night.</p>
<p>If you drive an electric vehicle to see the eerie <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/nature/hoodoos.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hoodoos</a> of Bryce Canyon National Park next year, you’ll have a far less anxious time than I did. The area recently won a Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/supercharger-voting/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contest</a> in which drivers could vote for future Supercharger locations. Its prize was a promise that a fast-charging station would come to Bryce Canyon City. Last Sunday, a <a href="https://supercharge.info/changes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> that tracks permits and public records to discover the location of future Superchargers indicated one will be built right there at Ruby’s Inn, the site of my struggle.</p>
<p>Bryce isn’t alone. As charging stops fill in the map of the U.S., Tesla is racing to build fast chargers near the remote National Parks of the West. Because just about every automaker is starting to use Tesla’s NACS plug, EVs of all sorts will be able to stop there. It’s about to become realistic to visit some of America’s most jaw-dropping scenery in an electric car.</p>
<p>When I started electric road-tripping in 2019 and 2020, only the superstars of the National Park System were truly accessible. High-speed charging stations existed in the tourist trap towns of Tusayan, Arizona, and West Yellowstone, Montana, giving Tesla drivers access to the Grand Canyon and to Yellowstone with little range anxiety. A site in Fish Camp, California, provided enough electrons to gaze upon El Capitan in Yosemite, while the baby Supercharger in Moab, Utah, powered you toward the Delicate Arch trail. Parks that happened to be located near an Interstate highway, like Petrified Forest and Zion, lay within reach for an EV. </p>
<p>Yet striking out for America’s more isolated wonders was a dicey proposition, one that relied upon hoping the slower chargers at hotels and visitor’s centers would be operational and unoccupied. Let me tell you: This is not a safe assumption.</p>
<p>To reach Crater Lake in 2022, we stayed 55 miles away in Klamath Falls, site of the nearest Supercharger. I pulled into the gift shop near the park’s entrance, hoping to add some safety juice for the day with the available Level 2 destination charger, but it was busted. No matter. Thanks to driving slowly around the lake and minding the speed limit back to Klamath (through a cloud of <a href="https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/klamath_midge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific local midges</a> that entirely glazed the front of the car in gelatinous bug guts), I completed the round trip back to the Supercharger station — only to find that the busted charger I tried to tap earlier in the day had bent a prong inside my Tesla port, rendering it unusable. We happened to be in the parking lot of a Fred Meyer home store at the time of this disastrous realization. In the moments before closing, I ran inside and procured the necessary hand tool to bend my metal back into shape. (<em>Note to readers: Do not do this.</em>) The DIY fix worked; the trip was saved.</p>
<p>You won’t need to resort to such extreme measures, however, because reliable and fast chargers are coming. Tesla has a <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/supercharger-chemult-or-us-97-lucs-issued-12-15-23-8-v3.319914/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permit</a> to build a Supercharger at a highway junction within 25 miles of Crater Lake, and given the park’s soaring popularity, that surely won’t be the last. Nor will you need to retreat from the heart of Death Valley to recharge in remote Beatty, Nevada because you couldn’t snag a plug at the park’s luxury hotel (though if you do go to Beatty, get the BBQ at Smokin’ J’s.). A Supercharger is coming to the closer town of <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/supercharger-pahrump-nv.321630/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pahrump</a>, and surely more are on their way.</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="https://supercharge.info/map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">map</a> and you’ll see many more examples. The arid expanses of southeastern New Mexico are charging desert now, but a planned Supercharger in Alamogordo will send EV drivers on their way to White Sands. Terlingua, Texas will provide a way to reach previously unreachable Big Bend along the Rio Grande River. Kalispell, Montana; Ely, Nevada; and Vernal, Utah will help electric drivers reach Glacier National Park, Great Basin National Park, and Dinosaur National Monument, respectively. More sites may come if the <a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/locate-charger/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third-party charging companies</a> or the automakers <a href="https://rivian.com/experience/charging#map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">building their own chargers</a> expand their offerings beyond the country’s most well-traveled highways.</p>
<p>It is a cruel twist of fate that traveling to some of the planet’s most majestic spots has, for so long, meant spewing carbon dioxide into its atmosphere. National parks, monuments, and forests are, by their very nature, far from population centers, and thus far from where most charging infrastructure grew up in the early years of this EV era. The treasures of the American West, especially, may be hours from the freeway and hundreds of miles from the nearest big city.</p>
<p>At last, the proposition of zero-emissions driving to America’s best idea is about to shift from fraught to ordinary. With longer driving ranges in new EVs and new fast chargers available en route to the parks, you won’t need to sit down with a map and a calculator, meticulously charting a strategy to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_Island" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wizard Island</a> without running out of miles. You’ll just pack the car and go.</p>

## Convicted killer Alex Murdaugh gets 40 years for financial crimes

date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Alex Murdaugh, the South Carolina lawyer convicted in a high-profile trial last year of murdering his wife and son, was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Monday for financial crimes. 


Murdaugh, 55, scion of an elite family of judges and attorneys, is already serving a life sentence for the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, 22, at the family hunting estate. 


Murdaugh pleaded guilty last year to state charges of stealing millions of dollars from clients of his prominent personal injury firm, and was sentenced to 27 years in prison. 


He was back in court on Monday for sentencing on federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and money laundering. 


District Judge Richard Gergel sentenced Murdaugh to 40 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the 27 years he already received. 


Murdaugh pleaded guilty to the federal charges in September, at which time U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said the disbarred lawyer's "financial crimes were extensive, brazen, and callous." 


"He stole indiscriminately from his clients, from his law firm, and from others who trusted him," Boroughs said. 


Murdaugh's televised three-week murder trial last year captivated viewers nationwide and outside the country. 


Evidence from his son's cellphone indicated Murdaugh was the only person with them at the estate's dog kennels several minutes before Maggie was killed with an assault rifle and Paul with a shotgun. 


Murdaugh denied killing his wife and younger son, but admitted stealing millions of dollars from clients of his law firm to feed an opioid addiction. 


Even before the trial finished, Netflix and HBO rushed out docu-dramas on the case.

## Channel opened for vessels clearing wreckage at Baltimore bridge collapse site

date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE — The U.S. Coast Guard has opened a temporary, alternate channel for vessels involved in the clearing of debris at the site of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, part of a phased approach to opening the main channel leading to the vital port, officials said. 


Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and concrete at the site of the bridge's deadly collapse into the Patapsco River after a container ship lost power and crashed into a supporting column. On Sunday, dive teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked the ship, and workers in lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of the twisted steel superstructure. 


Officials said the temporary channel is open only to vessels that are helping with the cleanup effort. Authorities believe four workers plunged to their deaths in the collapse. Recovery of their bodies is a key part of the ongoing salvage operation. 


Officials earlier said the channel would have a controlling depth of 11 feet (over 3 meters), a horizontal clearance of 264 feet (80 meters) and a vertical clearance of 96 feet (29 meters). A video released Sunday showed the Coast Guard dropping buoys in the water. 


"This marks an important first step along the road to reopening the port of Baltimore," Capt. David O'Connell, the federal on-scene coordinator of the response, said in a statement Monday. "By opening this alternate route, we will support the flow of marine traffic into Baltimore." 


On Monday, the Small Business Administration is opening a center in Dundalk, Maryland, to help small businesses get loans to help them with losses caused by the disruption of the bridge collapse. 


And President Joe Biden will visit the site of the bridge collapse on Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Monday. He will meet with state and local officials and get an "on-the-ground look" at federal response efforts, Jean-Pierre said. 


The bridge fell as the crew of the cargo ship Dali lost power and control on March 26. They called in a mayday, which allowed just enough time for police to stop vehicles from getting on the bridge, but not enough time to get a crew of eight workers off the structure. 


Two workers survived, two bodies were found in a submerged pickup, and four more men are presumed dead. Weather conditions and the tangled debris underwater have made it too dangerous for divers to search for their bodies. 


The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali, which was on its way out of port when it lost power. 


Along with clearing the shipping channel to reopen the port, officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge, which was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast Baltimore and became a symbol of the city's working-class roots and maritime culture. 


Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other U.S. facility.

## A deep dive into email deliverability in 2024

date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News

On October 3, 2023, Google and Yahoo announced upcoming email security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts. Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies. With the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs will begin tightening the reigns. Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024. In this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance. ↫ XOMedia Some of these changes &#8211; most of them impact bulk senders and spammers &#8211; should&#8217;ve been implemented ages ago, but seeing them being pushed by the three major email providers, who all happened to be owned, of course, by massive corporations, does raise quite a few red flags. Instinctively, this makes me worried about ulterior motives, especially since running your own email server is already fraught with issues due to the nebulous ways Gmail treats emails coming from small servers. With the rising interest in self-hosting and things like Mastodon, I hope we&#8217;re also going to see a resurgence in hosting your own e-mail. I really don&#8217;t like that all my email is going through Gmail &#8211; it&#8217;s what OSNews uses &#8211; but I don&#8217;t feel like dealing with all the delivery issues people who try self-hosting email lament about. With a possible renewed wave of interest in it, we might be able to make the process easier and more reliable.

## Has legislation to stop surprise medical bills worked?

date: 2024-04-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>We’ve been taking a close look on this program at the burdens of medical debt. Back in 2020, Congress passed the so-called “No Surprises Act” to protect patients from unexpected big bills for out-of-network medical care — and turns out, its wider impact on health care spending has yielded mixed results. But first on the show, California&#8217;s new $20-an-hour minimum wage for fast food goes into effect today. We&#8217;ll unpack reactions.</p>

Probably the sexiest feature in the whole thing. The bug was introduced on March 21, so it's been there a while. You have to hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, it should move to the top of the list immediately. So a good use-case is to leave Scripting News open with the blogroll visible and every once in a while you may find something interesting to read. I like having it there, but of course, it's my baby, so that's understandable. :-)

I tried <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/">listening</a> to one of Kara Swisher's interviews for her new book. The interviewer was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods weren't fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another podcast. She's got a great business model. Tell the press what they want to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.

## Microsoft to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny

date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News

Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been investigating Microsoft&#8217;s tying of Office and Teams since a 2020 complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. ↫ Foo Yun Chee at Reuters I honestly misread this as Microsoft selling Teams off, which would&#8217;ve been far bigger news. Unbundling Teams from Office globally is just Microsoft applying its recent European Union policy to the rest of the world. All we need now is Microsoft to stop trying to make Teams for families and friends happen, because nobody will ever want to use Teams for anything, let alone personal use.

## The hearts of the Super Nintendo

date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News

Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all the other chips. The CloCK output pin is connected to a copper line which spreads to most components, into their CLK input pin. If you are mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all kinds of processors have a CLK input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000, Intel Pentium, MOS 6502), to custom graphic chips (Midway&#8217;s DMA2, Capcom CPS-A/CPS-B, Sega&#8217;s Genesis VDP) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151, OKI msm6295), they all have one. ↫ Fabien Sanglard I&#8217;ve watched enough Adrian Black that I already knew all of this, and I&#8217;m assuming so did many of you. But hey, I&#8217;ll never pass up the opportunity to link to the insides of the Super Nintendo.

Another two to seven grants from the $6 billion Clean Communities Investment Accelerator will direct funding and technical assistance to nonprofits already serving disadvantaged communities. </p><h3>2. Contamination fears in Baltimore</h3><p>Environmental experts are concerned that the ongoing removal of wreckage from Baltimore’s collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge could cause oil or other hazardous materials to spill into the Patapsco River. Authorities have deployed nearly a mile’s worth of protective and absorbent barriers into the water, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/maryland-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-environment-1543f7a560b9e109761d9f89cdbab9b9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Associated Press</em> reports</a>, though a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/officials-baltimore-harbor-spill-not-an-immediate-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Friday</a> that “no immediate threat to the environment” had been identified. The cargo ship that struck the bridge was carrying at least 56 containers with hazardous materials, 14 of which were destroyed.

Vermont could be the first state to pass a climate superfund bill</h3><p>The Vermont Senate approved amendments on Friday to a bill that would seek compensation from fossil fuel companies for the impacts of climate change, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-superfund-vermont" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo reports</a>. Vermont’s climate superfund bill — one of several to have been introduced in state legislatures in recent years — would authorize the state to determine the cost it has borne from the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels over the past three decades and then ask responsible parties to pay up. (Vermont plans to focus its efforts on the world’s biggest emitters.) Modeled after federal Superfund law that keeps companies on the hook for cleaning up contamination, Vermont’s bill and others like it face an uncertain future and inevitable legal challenges.</p><h3>4.

Scientists have known for a long time that climate change is exacerbating heat waves, but the new study, published Friday in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>, determined that heat waves’ movement has slowed by 20% since 1979 — a decline of about 5 miles per day each decade. They’ve also gotten longer and more frequent. Wei Zhang, a climate scientist at Utah State University and one of the study’s authors, is particularly concerned about the effects of prolonged heat waves on urban areas. “If those heat waves last in the city for much longer than before, that would cause a very dangerous situation,” Zhang <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/climate/heat-waves-longer-slower.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p><h3>5.

date: 2024-04-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Funding for public schools partially depends on the number of students enrolled. But some public school districts are considering closing and consolidating schools due to enrollment declines that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new Cato Institute survey. We hear more. We&#8217;ll also learn more about agriculture&#8217;s impact on Colorado River basin levels and an anti-redlining law that&#8217;s currently on hold.</p>

## China could be on the road to economic recovery

date: 2024-04-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>From the BBC World Service: China may be showing signs of an economic recovery, with factory output slightly up for the first time in six months — an indicator that the country&#8217;s pandemic-induced slowdown may be starting to ease. Plus, in Germany, people can smoke cannabis in public starting today. Then, Turkey&#8217;s main opposition party has claimed big election victories in major cities; high inflation and general economic weakness may partially be behind the wins.</p>

## The Coal Was Destined for India. Now It’s Polluting the Air in Baltimore.

date: 2024-04-01, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg3NzI5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDg1Njg4Nn0.YjbT6N979_QX1HXbWLTSz5vZ_ktvabu-QhUocZgib5I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">For those living near the Port of Baltimore, the transportation and storage of coal on its way from mines in the Appalachian Mountains to far-flung foreign kilns is “a mundane but ever-present imposition,” Chloe Ahmann, a Cornell University anthropologist, told me. Ahmann once worked as an elementary school teacher in Curtis Bay, a residential neighborhood adjacent to the working port, and wrote a book on the area’s <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo215474590.html" target="_blank">post-industrial present</a>. </p><p>“There are stories going back generation,” she said. “Coal dust covering everything in the neighborhood — bicycles, porches, windowsill. People wipe coal dust off their windows as a daily ritual.”<br/></p><p>With the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and subsequent shutdown of the port, that coal now has nowhere to go for the foreseeable future. Baltimoreans don’t want it, but its intended recipients  thousands of miles away in India most certainly do.<br/><br/>“The top recipient of U.S. steam coal shipped from Baltimore by far over the past five years has been India, where the brick manufacturing industry has been a major customer,” the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61663" target="_blank">report</a> on the impacts of the bridge disaster. In January alone, the Port of Baltimore exported almost a million tons of coal to India, up almost three-fold from January of last year, <a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2551775-stuck-baltimore-coal-may-raise-prices-in-india-europe" target="_blank">according to Argus</a>, a commodity data provider. In total, 17 million tons of thermal coal — the type used in power plants and brick kilns — left the U.S. via Baltimore in 2023, S&P Global <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/020724-us-thermal-coal-exports-jump-264-on-year-to-44-million-mt-in-2023-census" target="_blank">found</a> by analyzing Census Bureau data.</p><p>India is the world’s <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2023/demand" target="_blank">second largest consumer of coal</a> after China, and coal accounts for over 70% of India's emissions from burning fuel, according to the International Energy Agency. (In contrast, <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/emissions" target="_blank">coal accounts for a fifth of the United States’ emissions from combustion</a>.) About a quarter of India’s emissions come from industry, much of which uses coal in its processes, including steelmaking, and cement and, yes, brick manufacturing.<br/></p><p>Brickmaking in India is often done on small scales by local producers, but even so, its energy consumption is “comparable to the organized construction industries such as cement and steel,” according to research published in <em>Nature India</em>. Many of those bricks are used to build homes, part and parcel of the country’s astounding economic growth. Along with its steel and cement industries, brickmaking has transformed India — <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=table" target="_blank">whose inflation-adjusted per capita GDP of around $1,800</a> in 1990 would have made it one of the world's poorest countries today — into the third-largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world.</p><p><span></span>The same brick industry that produces the literal building blocks of India’s homebuilding sector is also responsible for immensely damaging particulate pollution. The combination of coal and biomass used to fire brick kilns is responsible for around <a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/projects/improving-worker-skills-transform-indias-brick-sector#:~:text=Brick%20kilns%20emit%20approximately%2066,and%20sulfur%20dioxide%20air%20pollution." target="_blank">75 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions</a> — comparable to the total emissions of Washington State, Arizona, or the 2021 California wildfires — and 100,000 tons of black carbon emissions, according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</p><p>Air pollution in South Asia is one of the largest public health problems in the world. India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh all ranked in the <a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2022/component/air" target="_blank">bottom 10 of 180 countries</a> for air quality, according to the Yale University Environmental Performance Index. In 2019, air pollution was estimated to account for <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/international/air-pollution-in-inda.html#:~:text=Air%20pollution%20in%20India%20resulted,at%20Boston%20College%2C%20the%20Indian" target="_blank">around 1.7 million premature deaths</a> in India. “Brick kilns, involving the burning of low-grade coal, are one of the major sectors that contribute to air pollution in South Asia,” a <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/685751588227715919/pdf/Dirty-Stacks-High-Stakes-An-Overview-of-Brick-Sector-in-South-Asia.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank report said</a>, with the brick industry making up over 90% of particulate emissions in some South Asian cities and 15% of the most dangerous small particulate emissions in Delhi.<del></del></p><p>In a story that will be familiar to much of industrial and post-industrial America, these industrial processes are both an important economic engine and an obvious detriment to health locally and are contributing to the climatic changes that are already having <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/india/extreme-heat-india-climate-ac-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Rising%20heat&text=And%20the%20country's%20more%20tropical,Weather%20and%20Climate%20Extremes%20journal." target="_blank">devastating effects in South Asia</a>. Efforts to regulate the brick industry have already run into complaints that efficiency requirements will be <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/01/16/indias-brick-kiln-workers-fear-loss-of-livelihood-to-green-alternatives" target="_blank">too expensive for cash-strapped businesses</a> and will result in lower employment in the sector.</p><p>In the vertiginous world of globalized capitalism, different regions using the same resource — the Appalachian coal mines, the Baltimore port, and the Indian brick manufacturers — can all at the same time be at different stages of industrialization and post-industrialization, with differing attitudes toward the coal that powers and pollutes them. In South Baltimore, the people living with the dust from the coal pier no longer sees any positive relationship between industrial activity and their own well-being, Ahmann told me.</p><p>The Baltimore and Ohio railroad, which has been part of the rail conglomerate CSX since 1980, began construction in 1827 and has long shipped coal from West Virginia and other Appalachian states to the East Coast. Baltimore’s Curtis Bay neighborhood, where Ahmann lived, is adjacent to a coal pier operated by CSX. “It’s an iconic local scene, right by a local playground, stone throw from several elementary schools and homes,” Ahmann said, making the neighborhood both “heavily industrialized and very much a lived-in place.”</p><p>While the Maryland government trumpets direct and indirect employment at the port of around <a href="https://mpa.maryland.gov/Pages/executive-director.aspx" target="_blank">15,000 people</a>, that’s about half the number that worked there in 1970.</p><p>“It’s no longer the case that industry is a major employer in South Baltimore,” Ahmann said. “It’s not like it was 40 years ago, when everybody knew somebody whose livelihood was attached to industrial production in this place.” Instead, people in the area “cobble together lives from low-wage service jobs,” she said. Overall, manufacturing employment in Maryland has been roughly <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDMFG" target="_blank">cut in half since 1990</a>.</p><p>In late 2021, a CSX coal facility in Curtis Bay exploded, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/baltimore-councilwoman-to-seek-suspension-of-operations-at-csx-curtis-bay-coal-terminal/" target="_blank">damaging nearby homes</a> and spreading tremors for miles. Following the blast, a coalition of community groups and the Maryland Department of the Environment investigated particulate pollution in Curtis Bay and found coal dust “present throughout the community,” with coal dust coming from the terminal itself, as well as train and truck traffic.</p><p>“We should not have open air coal piers period, and certainly not in a residential area behind a playground,” Ahmann said.</p><p><span></span>Among the many fears locals are nursing as the Key Bridge lies in ruins is that the coal will simply pile up at the port as long as it remains blocked. “These piles are going to grow every day,” Ahmann told me, describing it as “stark visual evidence of the untenability of this situation.”</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone, we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind it—it's always nice to see parts of our boat we've never seen. We also replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of blisters <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/boat_projects/dyneema_halyard_splice.jpg" target="_blank">splicing dyneema</a> onto some of our existing halyards.</p>

## Pay per scroll

date: 2024-04-01, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>7.40 am. I’m sitting on a rock. Birds are chirping. Annoying rain coming down the gray sky. The rock I’m sitting on is wet. That’s also annoying. I’m sitting here, watching my dog walking up and down, destroying all the sticks that are lying on the ground. It’s a chilled morning.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m sitting here, typing this on my phone. I have my phone with me. I shouldn’t. I should have a book with me. But it’s raining. And books don’t go along well with rain.</p>
<p>Books are interesting objects. The entire consumption process of a book is interesting, especially when compared to websites. There’s no equivalent of the web for books. There’s no place where an infinite supply of books is available to you at virtually no cost. Reading a book involves some decision-making and, more often than not, some financial investment.</p>
<p>Sure, some of you are probably saying that libraries are the equivalent of the web for books but that’s not the same thing. And don’t get me wrong, libraries are great!</p>
<p>Reflecting on books made me think about what the web would look like if it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in order to be consumed. Which sites would I be willing to pay for? I’m going to ignore the obvious answers because I’m sure almost everyone would have sites like Wikipedia or YouTube. Those are boring answers. Aggregators such as Hacker News or Reddit would also not be something I’d be interested in paying for because the actual content lives somewhere else. So I’d be paying just for the commentary.</p>
<p>In my case, I’d probably pay for two types of websites: either personal sites of people that do things I enjoy or that have interesting takes on the world or sites that collect content coming from a diverse group of people (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> is a good example).</p>
<p>Would I be happy if the web was some sort of à la carte menu rather than a free buffet? I’d say no. Still, thinking about this made me realize—once again—that my media diet is something that I have to always keep in mind. It also reminded me that I’m not reading enough books!</p>                <hr>

## March 31, 2024

date: 2024-04-01, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden issued an executive order instructing the National Park Service to &#8220;highlight important figures and chapters in women&#8217;s history.&#8221; &#8220;Women and girls of all backgrounds have shaped our country&#8217;s history, from the ongoing fight for justice and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic achievements,&#8221; the announcement read. &#8220;Yet these contributions have often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women and girls in America&#8217;s story, including through the Federal Government&#8217;s recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.&#8221;

## After bridge collapse, Maryland governor urges Congress to pass funding for rebuild

date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — With efforts underway to clean up thousands of tons of steel debris from the collapsed bridge in Baltimore's harbor, Maryland Governor Wes Moore on Sunday urged Republicans to work with Democrats to approve the

federal funding needed for rebuilding the bridge and to get the port economy back on its feet.


Baltimore's Francis Scott Key bridge collapsed early on Tuesday morning, killing six road workers, when a container ship nearly the size of the Eiffel Tower lost power and crashed into a support pylon. Much of the span crashed into the Patapsco River, blocking the Port of Baltimore's shipping channel.


The Biden administration released $60 million in initial emergency aid on Thursday to assist in cleaning up the bridge debris and reopening the port, which is the largest in the U.S. for "roll-on, roll-off" vehicle imports and exports of farm and construction equipment. The port has been closed since Tuesday, leaving in limbo the jobs of some 15,000 people who rely on its daily operations.


Federal officials have told Maryland lawmakers the final cost of rebuilding the bridge could soar to at least $2 billion, Roll Call reported, citing a source familiar with the

Discussions.


Democratic President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the cost, but that will depend on passage of legislation authorizing the funds by both the Republican-led House of Representatives and Democratic-led Senate. The divided

Congress has been repeatedly riven by partisan battles over funding, with hardline Republicans often at odds even with members of their own party.


Moore, a Democrat, said Republicans should be willing to approve the funding for the sake of not just the city of Baltimore, but for the national economy.


"The reason that we need people to move in a bipartisan basis ... is not because we need you to do Maryland a favor," Moore told CNN on Sunday. "We need to make sure that we're actually moving quickly to get the American economy going again, because the Port of Baltimore is instrumental in our larger economic growth."


Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg expressed optimism on Sunday that Congress would approve the funds necessary for the cleanup and rebuild, noting that the divided legislative body had passed Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure package in 2021.


"If there's anything left in this country that is more bipartisan than infrastructure, it should be emergency response.


This is both, and I hope that Congress will be willing if and when we turn to them," Buttigieg told CBS's "Face the Nation."


Biden was expected to visit the bridge collapse site this week.


An enormous crane began cutting up portions of the collapsed bridge to prepare them for removal on Saturday, which officials said was the first step of what will be a long and complicated cleanup. A spokesperson for the governor's office said on Sunday that a 180-metric ton (200-ton) piece of the bridge had been removed and officials were working to determine the best strategy for pulling the ship off the wreckage.


Later Sunday officials said they were preparing to establish an alternate route for "commercially essential vessels," although few additional details were released and the timing of the alternate route's opening wasn't made clear.


In a statement, coordinator Capt. David O'Connell said that the alternate would "support the flow of marine traffic into Baltimore." Video released by responders showed Coast Guard officials dropping buoys into the water near the site of the collision.


The wreckage and hazardous weather conditions have made it impossible for divers to continue searching for the four remaining bodies of the deceased construction workers in recent days, Moore said.


Moore and other officials have declined to give an estimated timeline for the reopening of the port and the rebuilding of the bridge.

## Why Corporations Fail to Protect Our Data

date: 2024-04-01, from: Om Malik blog

Almost nine years ago, when both T-Mobile and Experian were hacked, I wrote an&#160;article for The New&#160;Yorker. I argued&#160;that the companies&#160;wouldn’t&#160;learn anything from the mess created by these data and privacy breaches. As&#160;a&#160;result,&#160;we,&#160;the&#160;citizens,&#160;are&#160;now simply&#160;Data Piñatas. Consumers have become data piñatas &#8211; hacked, tracked and abused by everyone from hackers, governments, and worse of them all, &#8230;

## Ora2Pg 24.3 have been released

date: 2024-04-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Bangkok, Thailand - March 29th, 2024</p>
<h2>Ora2Pg</h2>
<p>Version 24.3 of Ora2Pg, a free and reliable tool used to migrate an
Oracle database to PostgreSQL, has been officially released and is
publicly available for download.</p>
<p>This release fixes several issues reported since last release and especially
a regression in GEOMETRY data export. As usual, it also adds some new features
and improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add new configuration directive <code>ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH</code> to control the "prefetch"
    used by oracle_fdw COPY/INSERT. Prior to this change Ora2Pg uses the default "prefetch"
    of oracle_fdw, which at the time of writing is 50. Allowing this to be controlled by an
    Ora2Pg configuration/option gives the option of increased performance at the cost of
    some additional memory on the PostgreSQL side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new configuration directive <code>PGTT_NOSUPERUSER</code>. By default the pgtt
    extension is loaded using the superuser privilege when <code>EXPORT_GTT</code> is
    activated. Enabled it if you run the SQL scripts generated using a non
    superuser user. It will use: <code>LOAD '$libdir/plugins/pgtt';</code> instead of
    <code>LOAD 'pgtt';</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Backward compatibility changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the behavior of triggers export with <code>EXPORT_INVALID</code>. It used to
    apply to <code>ENABLED</code> or <code>DISABLED</code> triggers instead of real <code>VALID</code> or <code>INVALID</code>
    triggers. Export of invalid triggers will be controlled by <code>EXPORT_INVALID</code>
    like others objects like functions, packages, etc. This mean that disabled
    triggers that are valid will be exported by default now, this was not
    the case before.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list of change see <a href="https://github.com/darold/ora2pg/blob/master/changelog">https://github.com/darold/ora2pg/blob/master/changelog</a></p>
<h2>Links  &amp; Credits</h2>
<p>I would like to thank all users who submitted patches and users
who reported bugs and feature requests, they are all cited
the changelog file.</p>
<p>Ora2Pg is an open project. Any contribution to build a better tool is
welcome. You just have to send your ideas, features requests or patches
