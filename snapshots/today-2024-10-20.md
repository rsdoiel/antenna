## What docs as code really means

date: 2024-10-20, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve recently started a new job as a documentation engineer. My work is largely the same as that of a technical writer, but the sound and semantics of my new title gave me some pause and made me think about what it really means to be doing docs-as-code. To say that it’s about writing documentation using the same tools and methods as software developers is correct, but fails to acknowledge the full consequences of the fact. Most descriptions of docs-as-code are naive because they stop at the implications of being developers’ attachés.</p>

## Sergey Durmanov opened issue #153: Compiler trap when compiling a call to {C} procedures (procedural variables) for the UnixARM platform at Felix Oliver Frie...

date: 2024-10-20, updated: 2024-10-20, from: Oberon A2 repository


<p dir="auto">I&#39;m trying to adapt the Linux API to run on Android (in Termux) of the A2 UnixARM build. The kernel runs, but there are problems when compiling the adapted modules. When compiling for the UnixARM platform, the compiler traps if the procedure (procedural variable) is marked with the {C} modifier and contains an argument of the SIGNED64 type.</p>

Trump losing it in a whole other way. He wanders around on stage at a rally, in silence? They say it&#39;s 16 minutes, but I haven&#39;t watched all of it yet.

Musk is camped out in Pennsylvania, working on Trump&#39;s ground game. Heard Trippi&#39;s guest yesterday mock Musk, but I think this may be the moment the Dems wish they had worked more closely with the open web.

## Chromium’s influence on Chromium alternatives

date: 2024-10-19, from: OS News

I don’t think most people realize how Firefox and Safari depend on Google for more than “just” revenue from default search engine deals and prototyping new web platform features. Off the top of my head, Safari and Firefox use the following Chromium libraries: libwebrtc, libbrotli, libvpx, libwebp, some color management libraries, libjxl (Chromium may eventually contribute a Rust JPEG-XL implementation to Firefox; it’s a hard image format to implement!), much of Safari’s cryptography (from BoringSSL), Firefox’s 2D renderer (Skia)…the list goes on. Much of Firefox’s security overhaul in recent years (process isolation, site isolation, user namespace sandboxes, effort on building with ControlFlowIntegrity) is directly inspired by Chromium’s architecture. ↫ Rohan “Seirdy” Kumar Definitely an interesting angle on the browser debate I hadn&#8217;t really stopped to think about before. The argument is that while Chromium&#8217;s dominance is not exactly great, the other side of the coin is that non-Chromium browsers also make use of a lot of Chromium code all of us benefit from, and without Google doing that work, Mozilla would have to do it by themselves, and let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re in a great position to do so. I&#8217;m not saying I buy the argument, but it&#8217;s an argument nonetheless. I honestly wouldn&#8217;t mind a slower development pace for the web, since I feel a lot of energy and development goes into things making the web worse, not better. Redirecting some of that development into things users of the web would benefit from seems like a win to me, and with the dominant web engine Chromium being run by an advertising company, we all know where their focus lies, and it ain&#8217;t on us as users. I&#8217;m still firmly on the side of less Chromium, please.
