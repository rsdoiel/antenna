<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I threw this creamy Tex-Mex chicken noodle casserole together with
items I had in the pantry when I forgot I had company coming for dinner.
They loved it! You can also use leftover pork or turkey in place of the
chicken. —Marina Castle Kelley, Santa Clarita, California</p>

with Spicy Fennel Relish</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Pork chops are great for grilling! If you have time, marinate them
for several hours or overnight before grilling for even more flavor. You
could also add lemon juice and zest to the marinade to add a bright
citrus note to the pork. &amp;mdash;Gilda Lester, Millsboro,

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I came up with this one evening when I had butternut squash, fresh
picked apples and dried cranberries. I combined the ingredients into one
succulent pork dish and everyone raved over it. This is also good with
some added cinnamon or a garlic pepper rub. —Shirley Tuttle-Malone,

<p>These sweet, spicy, sticky chicken wings are lip-smacking good! You
could use fresh peaches in place of canned. However, I would add a few
tablespoons of brown sugar if so. —Sue Falk, Sterling Heights,

<h2 id="san-francisco-cioppino">San Francisco Cioppino</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Traditionally, cioppino is made with whatever seafood was caught that
day or whatever seafood is on hand. It began as a soup for the working
class, but with how delicious it tastes, it’s no wonder this dish made
its way into high-end restaurants and hotels. Feel free to use whatever
fish, shellfish and seafood you can find. —Barbara Pletzke, Herndon,
Virginia</p>

Because it uses soy milk, it’s a smart choice if you’re lactose

Cream</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Humphry Slocombe’s Secret Breakfast is a rich vanilla ice cream
infused with bourbon. Crunchy golden brown cornflake cookies are swirled
within. I came up with this recipe for friends who can’t find Humphry
Slocombe ice cream. —Andrea Potischman, Menlo Park, California</p>

<h2 id="appalachian-stack-cake-with-apple-bourbon-sauce">Appalachian
Stack Cake with Apple-Bourbon Sauce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>My version of a completely traditional Appalachian stack cake was
inspired by the way my ancestors would have made it many moons ago. All
the ingredients are there: dried apples, a stiff dough, molasses and
apple butter. My only flair is adding a bourbon sauce to drip over the
edges and right into your heart. —Lauren May, &lt;a

<h2 id="healthy-spinach-artichoke-dip">Healthy Spinach Artichoke
Dip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I love this recipe because you get all the deliciousness of spinach
artichoke dip without the heaviness of too much cheese and cream! It’s
great with cut-up whole wheat pitas for dipping. —Kristyne Mcdougle,
Lorain, OH</p>

<h2 id="tuna-cheese-waffle-sandwiches">Tuna Cheese-Waffle
Sandwiches</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I love cheddar waffles (or chaffles) as well as tuna salad
sandwiches. Combining the two makes for an incredible lunchtime stack.
The dill pickles in both the waffles and salad add extra crunch and
flavor. —Arlene Erlbach, Morton Grove, Illinois</p>

<h2 id="creamy-strawberry-icebox-cake">Creamy Strawberry Icebox
Cake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>My family loves this icebox cake for two reasons: First, it is a
delicious way to use strawberries at their peak in summertime, and
second, it requires no baking, which keeps the kitchen cool! This
dessert feels extravagant but is so easy to make. —Nancy Mock,
Colchester, Vermont</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I love this recipe for many reasons, but mostly because it is both
simple and delicious. It was passed down from my Italian grandmother,
and I modified it only slightly. I have used it and enjoyed it for
years. —Karen Mahlke, Estero, Florida</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Instead of french fries with my burgers and sandwiches, I love to
serve these air-fryer zucchini fries. They’re crispy, delicious and a
wonderful way to use up the zucchini from my garden. —Matthew Hass,

better than the original, but mine really is. —Ralph Jones, San Diego,

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>With a ribbon of fresh homemade fruit filling, this homey coffee cake
is perfect for breakfast with friends and family. But it is also equally
delicious warm out of the air fryer for a weeknight dessert. —Shirley

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>When it starts to get cold, I love to make this quick and creamy
Tater Tot bake. It’s a delightful homey dinner that’s easy to put
together. I make it ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator. Then
I just pop it into the air fryer when I get home. —Donna Donhauser,

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Butternut squash tossed with southwestern spices makes a wonderful
base for vegetarian tacos. I’m always looking for easy and healthy
dinners for my family, and this dish is delicious! —Elisabeth Larsen,

<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>With just a few ingredients and steps, this recipe is nearly
impossible to mess up. The thin, fall-apart-tender slices are delicious
on their own but also make other dishes, such as tacos and Frito pies,
taste better. —Darla Andrews, Boerne, Texas</p>

<h2 id="butter-pecan-cookie-bars-with-penuche-drizzle">Butter Pecan
Cookie Bars with Penuche Drizzle</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I have made these bars for many, many years. They are rich, chewy,
nutty and buttery—all the good stuff. I like to use dark brown sugar for
the extra flavor. A sprinkle of some pecans on the top makes for a nice
nutty, toasted flavor. They freeze well, that is, if they last long
enough! A little drizzle of old-fashioned penuche icing takes them over
the top. You could eat these without the penuche, but why would you want
to? —Kallee Krong-McCreery, Escondido, California</p>

can add your own favorite pizza toppings as long as you include the
ooey-gooey melty cheese on top. If you can’t find the tomato and sweet
basil bisque soup, try using canned tomato bisque soup and adding
Italian seasoning. —Susan Bickta, Kutztown, Pennsylvania</p>

Bark</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Classic dark chocolate peppermint bark gets a new look by swirling
dark and white chocolate together. You can also layer them if you wish.
Be sure to use real peppermint oil (not extract) so your chocolate won’t
seize into a big clump.

These fudgy, chocolatey black bean brownies are gluten-free, flourless, and made with a simple can of black beans! They&amp;#8217;re the perfect healthy twist on the traditional dessert and so easy to make. Just throw everything in a blender, and it&amp;#8217;s ready in 30 minutes from start to finish! These black bean brownies are seriously impressive. [&amp;#8230;] </code></pre>
