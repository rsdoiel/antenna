<p>The Sakura Matsuri, also known as the Cherry Blossom Festival,
celebrates the spring season! These squishy treats make adorable drink
garnishes and are a great kids’ activity (they’re basically nontoxic
play dough and a lot less messy). If you want to prep them in advance,
make the balls but don’t boil them just yet! Sprinkle a little glutinous
rice flour on them and freeze them in an airtight container. Boil them
right before you plan to serve them. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles,

AND UNLUCKY FOODS IN IRISH FOLKLORE: WHAT FOODS WERE CONSIDERED OMENS OF
GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
The Roots of Food Superstitions in Irish Folklore In the rich and
layered tradition of Irish folklore, food has always carried meanings
far beyond nourishment. In ancient Ireland, the line between daily life
and the spiritual world was often blurred, and meals were believed to be
closely tied to omens, blessings, and curses. Long before the era of
supermarkets and processed goods, what people ate—and when, how, and
with whom—was steeped in ritual and significance. The Irish, like many
Celtic peoples, lived in harmony with the rhythms of the earth, the
seasons, and the spirits they believed dwelled in nature. Certain foods
were believed to bring protection or luck, while others were avoided for
fear of inviting misfortune. These beliefs were passed down orally
through generations, embedded in seasonal festivals like Samhain and
Imbolc, and often tied to the cycles of planting, harvesting, and family
life. For instance, breaking bread with a stranger was seen as an act of
good faith and protection against bad luck, while spilling salt at the
table was considered a serious omen—unless quickly countered by tossing
a pinch over your left shoulder. These customs weren’t simply quaint
habits; they were a way of safeguarding the household and inviting
prosperity through everyday rituals. As we explore the specific foods
believed to bring fortune or folly in Irish folklore, we’ll also gain a
window into the cultural values, fears, and hopes of generations past.
From the significance of dairy to the omens hidden in fruit and bread,
each bite tells a deeper story. Blessed Bites – Foods That Invited Good
Fortune In Irish folklore, certain foods weren’t just nourishment—they
were seen as blessings in disguise. These lucky foods were woven into
seasonal rituals, family customs, and even courting practices, believed
to bring protection, prosperity, and health to those who consumed them
with respect and intention. One of the most revered lucky foods in Irish
tradition was butter. In rural Ireland, butter wasn’t just a staple; it
was a symbol of abundance and the fruits of the family’s hard work.
People would smear a bit of butter on the doorstep or bury a small lump
near the hearth at Beltane (May Day) to attract good luck and a fertile
season. It was also believed that offering butter to traveling faeries
or passing beggars ensured continued blessings from both the natural and
spiritual worlds. Oats and oatcakes were also considered lucky,
especially when eaten at the start of a journey or a new venture.
Farmers and travelers might carry oatcakes for protection, and eating
them before leaving home was thought to bring safe travels and favorable
outcomes. Oats symbolized steadiness, warmth, and sustenance—everything
needed to weather life’s uncertainties. Eggs, too, were seen as
fortunate, particularly when given as gifts. They represented new life
and rebirth, and gifting eggs to neighbors—especially around Easter—was
a way to strengthen community bonds and share blessings. In addition to
specific foods, sharing a meal was itself an act that drew luck.
Offering food to guests, travelers, or even the poor was considered a
sacred gesture. The Irish proverb “It is in the shelter of each other
that the people live” was embodied in this tradition. Feeding others was
not only an act of kindness but also a way to ensure that good fortune
continued to flow through the household. Even apple tarts held symbolic
meaning—when baked with a small coin or charm inside (a precursor to
today’s barmbrack custom at Halloween), the finder was said to be
blessed with wealth, love, or luck, depending on the object discovered.
These customs weren’t arbitrary—they reflected a deep belief in the
spiritual energy of the home and the idea that food, when respected and
shared, was a conduit for good fortune. Cursed Crumbs – Foods Believed
to Bring Bad Luck Just as some foods were revered for their power to
bring luck, others were cautiously avoided or treated with suspicion in
Irish folklore. These “unlucky” foods were believed to attract
misfortune, illness, or even supernatural wrath if mishandled or
consumed at the wrong time or in the wrong way. One of the most widely
feared practices was baking bread on a Sunday. While bread itself was a
sacred and sustaining staple, making it on the Lord’s Day was thought to
invite bad luck or even divine disapproval. Some believed the bread
would fail to rise or turn out poorly, while others feared it would
bring disharmony into the home. Sunday was a day of rest, and violating
that sanctity with labor like baking was considered both disrespectful
and ominous. Spilled salt was another bad omen, mirroring a superstition
found across many cultures. In Irish homes, spilling salt was thought to
invite quarrels or misfortune, particularly if it occurred during a
meal. The traditional remedy was to throw a pinch of the spilled salt
over your left shoulder to blind the devil waiting behind you—an action
meant to ward off the evil energy attracted by carelessness. Leaving
milk out overnight was also seen as risky. In some parts of Ireland, it
was believed that faeries might take the milk—or worse, sour it—if it
was not properly covered or protected. The milk of the household cow was
a vital resource, and great care was taken to keep it “clean” of
supernatural interference. Some households placed a sprig of rowan or a
bit of iron nearby to ward off bad luck or faerie mischief. Even eggs,
while lucky in some contexts, could carry bad luck if misused. Breaking
an egg and finding a double yolk was seen as an omen—sometimes of
pregnancy or prosperity, but in darker traditions, it could foreshadow a
death in the family, particularly if it happened unexpectedly or
repeatedly. Perhaps the most dramatic superstition surrounded throwing
food away. In times when food was scarce and precious, wasting it wasn’t
just impractical—it was considered spiritually dangerous. To discard
bread, for example, without saying a blessing or apology could offend
divine forces or household spirits. There was

<h2 id="stampy-stampies">STAMPY (STAMPIES)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Stampy is a humble, survival-era Irish dish made from
mashed turnips or potatoes, lightly salted, and eaten cold. It was
commonly prepared in leaner times and served as a filling, no-fuss meal.
Though simple, it reflects the resilience and ingenuity of Irish rural
cooking. Prep Time: 10 minutesCook Time: 25 minutesServings: 4
Ingredients: 4 medium floury potatoes or 2 medium turnips (or a mix) 1–2
tsp salt (to taste) Optional: a knob of butter or a drizzle of cream
(modern twist) Instructions: 1.Peel &amp; Boil:Peel the potatoes or
turnips. Chop into chunks and boil in lightly salted water until soft
(about 20–25 minutes). 2.Drain &amp; Mash:Drain thoroughly. Mash until
smooth. You can add a pinch more salt at this stage or a little butter
if desired, though traditional versions used none. 3.Cool &amp;
Set:Spread the mash into a shallow dish and allow it to cool completely.
It will firm up slightly as it cools. 4.Serve Cold:Cut into rough slices
or scoop into portions. Traditionally eaten plain, though sometimes with
buttermilk or bread. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. This dish
was often made in the evening and eaten cold the next day, straight from
the dish or with a bit of sour milk.

BREAD)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Fadge is a traditional Northern Irish potato bread, often
sweetened with apples in the autumn months. It’s a comforting, rustic
griddle bread that’s soft, slightly tart from the apples, and typically
served warm with butter or even a drizzle of honey. Prep Time: 20
minutesCook Time: 10–12 minutesServings: Makes about 8 wedges
Ingredients: 2 medium floury potatoes (about 1 cup mashed) 1 cup plain
(all-purpose) flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp butter (plus more for
frying) 1 tbsp sugar (optional, for a sweeter version) 1 pinch salt 1
small tart apple (e.g., Bramley or Granny Smith), peeled and finely

Instructions: 1.Boil &amp; Mash Potatoes:Peel and boil potatoes in
salted water until soft. Drain well and mash with the butter until
smooth. Let cool slightly. 2.Make Dough:In a mixing bowl, combine the
mashed potatoes, flour, sugar (if using), and salt. Stir in the finely

if it’s too dry. 3.Shape the Fadge:Turn dough onto a floured surface.
Roll out into a circle about ½ inch thick. Cut into 8 triangles (like a
pizza). 4.Cook:Heat a little butter on a non-stick griddle or skillet
over medium heat. Cook the fadge pieces for about 5–6 minutes per side,
until golden brown and cooked through. 5.Serve:Best served warm with
butter, jam, or even a sharp cheddar. It’s lovely at breakfast or with
afternoon tea.
