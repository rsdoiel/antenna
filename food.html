      Poke spring rolls take everything you love about a poke bowl and tuck it neatly into a hand-held roll. Think tender sushi-grade fish paired with crunchy vegetables and creamy avocado, all wrapped in delicate rice paper that shows off the colorful filling inside. The rolls are light yet satisfying, perfect for dipping into a tangy ponzu soy sauce. Fresh, customizable and bursting with flavor, these rolls are a fun way to enjoy poke in a portable, shareable form. —Thaotam To, Los Angeles, California

      <h1>THE RISE OF IRISH CRAFT CHOCOLATE: BEAN-TO-BAR IN THE EMERALD ISLE</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://irishfoodhub.com/irish-craft-chocolate-bean-to-bar/">Irish Food Hub</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Chocolate may not be native to Ireland, but in recent years the Emerald Isle has carved out a name for itself in the world of artisanal bean-to-bar chocolate. A new generation of Irish chocolatiers is blending craftsmanship, sustainability, and a deep respect for Irish food heritage to create world-class chocolate with a distinctly Irish twist. From small coastal towns to bustling cities, craft chocolate makers are redefining how chocolate is made and enjoyed, transforming it from a sweet indulgence into a cultural experience.  Table of Contents The Origins of Craft Chocolate in Ireland Bean-to-Bar: What Makes Irish Craft Chocolate Unique? Meet the Makers: Ireland’s Leading Craft Chocolatiers Sustainability and Ethics in Irish Chocolate Making The Future of Irish Craft Chocolate: Trends and Global Recognition The Origins of Craft Chocolate in Ireland While Ireland has long been associated with rich dairy, hearty breads, and traditional sweets, chocolate has a surprisingly short but fascinating history on the island. For much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, chocolate in Ireland was dominated by imported brands and mass-produced confectionery. However, the seeds of a craft chocolate movement were planted in the late 20th century as Irish food culture began to embrace artisanal traditions, from farmhouse cheeses to craft beers. The early pioneers of Irish chocolate making often drew inspiration from European chocolatiers, particularly those in Belgium, Switzerland, and France. Small-scale producers began experimenting with higher-quality cocoa, using Ireland’s renowned dairy products—especially cream and butter—to create smooth, rich chocolates that reflected Irish culinary character. These early efforts were less about bean-to-bar production and more about crafting a premium product that went beyond the mass-market chocolate bars found in every shop. As Ireland’s food culture grew more sophisticated, with the rise of farmers’ markets, artisan bakeries, and a strong farm-to-table ethos, chocolate makers also began looking for ways to distinguish their craft. By the early 2000s, the global bean-to-bar movement was gaining momentum, with chocolatiers around the world sourcing cacao directly from farmers, roasting beans themselves, and controlling the entire chocolate-making process. Ireland, never one to shy away from blending tradition with innovation, soon found itself at the forefront of this shift. Coastal towns such as Dingle and small communities in Cork and Wicklow became unlikely hubs for chocolate experimentation. Here, independent chocolatiers began roasting cacao beans themselves, hand-tempering chocolate, and infusing their creations with local flavors—such as Irish sea salt, whiskey, honey, and even seaweed. These bold experiments not only put Irish craft chocolate on the map but also tapped into a growing demand for authenticity, sustainability, and unique taste experiences. In this way, Irish craft chocolate has mirrored the broader Irish food renaissance: rooted in tradition, inspired by the land and sea, yet open to global influences.  Bean-to-Bar – What Makes Irish Craft Chocolate Unique? The phrase “bean-to-bar” describes a chocolate-making process in which artisans oversee every stage of production—from sourcing raw cacao beans to creating the finished chocolate bar. Unlike mass-market producers, who often buy pre-processed cocoa liquor or couverture, bean-to-bar chocolatiers control each step, ensuring transparency, quality, and creativity. In Ireland, this approach has taken on a distinctly local character, shaped by the island’s culinary traditions and values. Direct relationships with cacao farmers: Irish craft chocolatiers emphasize ethical sourcing. Many work directly with small-scale cacao farmers in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, paying fair prices that support sustainable livelihoods. This farmer-focused approach echoes Ireland’s own history of small farming communities, fostering a sense of solidarity across continents. Roasting and flavor development: By roasting cacao beans themselves, Irish chocolatiers can experiment with temperature and time to highlight unique flavor notes. Just as Irish whiskey makers carefully distill to capture depth of flavor, bean-to-bar chocolatiers bring out profiles ranging from fruity and floral to nutty and earthy. The result is chocolate with a complexity rarely found in mass-produced brands. Irish terroir and local ingredients: What truly distinguishes Irish craft chocolate is the way it blends global cacao with Irish flavors. Makers often incorporate local ingredients such as sea salt from West Cork, honey from rural beekeepers, or whiskey from historic distilleries. Some even experiment with seaweed or wild herbs, tying chocolate to the Irish landscape in surprising ways. This fusion not only creates unique taste experiences but also grounds Irish chocolate in a sense of place.. Transparency and education: Many bean-to-bar chocolatiers in Ireland open their workshops to the public, offer tasting sessions, and educate consumers about the journey of chocolate. This emphasis on storytelling reflects Ireland’s cultural love of narrative, turning each chocolate bar into both a treat and a lesson about sustainability, farming, and craftsmanship. Small scale, big impact: While the number of Irish bean-to-bar producers is still relatively small, their impact is growing. Their focus on quality over quantity allows them to innovate with flavor combinations and production methods, positioning Irish chocolate as a premium product on the global stage. In short, Irish bean-to-bar chocolate is unique because it marries global connections with local identity. It takes the universal language of chocolate and gives it an Irish accent—one that speaks of authenticity, sustainability, and flavor. Meet the Makers – Ireland’s Leading Craft Chocolatiers The rise of Irish craft chocolate has been fueled by passionate chocolatiers who combine artistry, sustainability, and a deep respect for flavor. These makers, often working in small workshops along the coast or in rural towns, are redefining what Irish chocolate can be. Their dedication has placed Ireland firmly on the map of the global bean-to-bar movement. Bean and Goose (County Wexford): Founded by sisters Karen and Natalie Keane, Bean and Goose is one of Ireland’s most celebrated bean-to-bar producers. Their chocolate emphasizes seasonality and Irish terroir, often infused with ingredients such as hazelnuts, foraged berries, and sea salt from the Atlantic. They are also known for their beautifully designed bars that celebrate Ireland’s landscapes and traditions. Exploding Tree (County Cork): A pioneering bean-to-bar maker, Exploding Tree produces organic chocolate from ethically sourced beans. Their focus is on transparency and sustainability, and their flavors range from</p>

      <h1>SEAWEED SNACKS: IRELAND’S SUPERFOOD GOES MAINSTREAM</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://irishfoodhub.com/seaweed-snacks-ireland-superfood/">Irish Food Hub</a>)
      <p>
      <p>For centuries, the Irish coastline has been more than just a source of stunning views and abundant fish—it has also provided one of the world’s most powerful superfoods: seaweed. Long used in traditional Irish cooking and medicine, seaweed is now experiencing a global revival, emerging as a modern health snack celebrated for its nutritional benefits and unique flavors. From traditional carrageen moss puddings to crispy roasted kelp chips, seaweed has traveled from humble coastal communities into health food shops, restaurants, and kitchens around the world.  Table of Contents The History of Seaweed in Irish Food Culture Nutritional Powerhouse: Why Seaweed Is Ireland’s Original Superfood From Shore to Shelf: The Rise of Seaweed Snacks Irish Seaweed in Modern Cuisine and Global Food Trends The Future of Seaweed: Sustainability, Innovation, and Everyday Eating The History of Seaweed in Irish Food Culture Seaweed has been part of Ireland’s diet and folk tradition for over a thousand years. With a rugged Atlantic coastline stretching more than 3,000 kilometers, Ireland has always had abundant access to edible seaweeds such as dulse (Palmaria palmata), carrageen moss (Chondrus crispus), and kelp. Generations of coastal communities relied on these marine plants as vital sources of nutrition, medicine, and even fertilizer for the land. Historical records and folklore highlight the central role of seaweed in Irish life. During times of hardship, particularly in famine years, seaweed was harvested as a life-sustaining food. Dulse was often eaten dried, chewed like a savory snack, or added to broths for its salty, umami-rich flavor. Carrageen moss was prized for its natural gelling properties and was boiled into puddings, custards, and tonics believed to cure colds and stomach ailments. Kelp, meanwhile, was burned for its ash, which was used in soap-making and as a source of iodine. Beyond food, seaweed had deep cultural significance. In many parts of Ireland, coastal families would pass down harvesting traditions, timing their collection with the tides and drying the seaweed on rocks under the sun. These practices not only provided sustenance but also fostered a sense of connection between the community and the ocean. Festivals and local markets often featured stalls selling bunches of dried dulse, which were enjoyed much like sweets are today. While inland communities were less likely to consume seaweed regularly, coastal regions treated it as an everyday staple. For fishermen, farmers, and families living along the western seaboard, seaweed was both a comfort food and a necessity. Its high mineral content helped supplement diets that might otherwise lack variety, especially during long winters. This rich history forms the foundation for the modern seaweed revival. Once regarded as a survival food, seaweed is now being reimagined as a gourmet ingredient and health snack. The cultural memory of chewing dulse or sipping carrageen moss pudding has evolved into the creation of seaweed crisps, powders, and energy bars that appeal to contemporary tastes.  Nutritional Powerhouse – Why Seaweed Is Ireland’s Original Superfood Seaweed has earned the title of “Ireland’s original superfood” for good reason. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, these marine vegetables provide a nutritional profile that few land-grown plants can match. For centuries, coastal communities instinctively recognized its value, long before modern science confirmed the benefits. Rich in essential minerals: Seaweed is naturally high in iodine, calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Iodine is particularly important for healthy thyroid function, and historically, seaweed was one of the only reliable dietary sources of this mineral. This helped prevent deficiencies in coastal communities, supporting metabolism and overall health. High in vitamins: Many Irish seaweeds contain significant amounts of vitamins A, C, E, and K, as well as several B vitamins. Vitamin C, found in dulse, was especially useful in preventing scurvy, making seaweed a critical survival food during harsh winters and long sea voyages. Vitamin K, meanwhile, plays an essential role in bone and blood health. Protein and fiber content: Some seaweeds, such as spirulina and kelp, are high in protein, making them an excellent plant-based supplement in a diet otherwise centered on grains, potatoes, and meat. Seaweed is also rich in dietary fiber, which aids digestion, supports gut health, and promotes a feeling of fullness, making it an ideal snack for modern health-conscious eaters. Low in calories, big on flavor: Despite its impressive nutrient density, seaweed is very low in calories and fat. Its naturally salty, umami-rich taste makes it a flavorful alternative to less healthy processed snacks. In this way, seaweed delivers both satisfaction and nutrition without compromising on health goals. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds: Research has shown that Irish seaweeds contain unique bioactive compounds that may reduce inflammation, improve heart health, and even protect against certain chronic illnesses. These properties make seaweed an exciting area of study for modern nutrition science, as traditional uses find support in new research. Because of this powerful nutritional profile, seaweed has transitioned from being a food of necessity in coastal Ireland to one of luxury and wellness in the modern world. What was once a humble snack for fishermen is now found in health food stores, smoothie powders, and gourmet restaurants. This transformation highlights seaweed’s versatility—not only as a survival staple but as a food for the future. From Shore to Shelf – The Rise of Seaweed Snacks What was once a simple, dried snack chewed by Irish fishermen has now become a global food trend. Seaweed snacks, in their many forms, are enjoying a renaissance as consumers worldwide seek out healthier, sustainable alternatives to processed foods. Ireland, with its long history of seaweed harvesting and pristine Atlantic coastline, is playing a leading role in this movement. Traditional roots, modern twist: Dried dulse, once sold in coastal markets and fairs, has inspired today’s packaged seaweed crisps and nori-style sheets. Carrageen moss, once boiled into puddings, is now available as a powdered thickener in smoothies and health products. These modern iterations connect back to Ireland’s heritage while meeting contemporary tastes for convenience and variety.
