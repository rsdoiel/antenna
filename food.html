The soft apple filling mimics the sweetness and texture of ripe mangoes. Served with a cinnamon-infused coconut milk sauce, it’s a dessert that brings together summer vibes and fall coziness in one bowl. —Tam To, Los Angeles, California</p>

      <p>There’s a new side for Thanksgiving this year: creamy, comforting pumpkin Gruyere pasta. It's fancy enough for a holiday but easy enough for a weeknight dinner that won’t break the budget. Velvety pumpkin puree blends with nutty Gruyere cheese to create a luscious sauce that clings to every noodle, while fried sage leaves add a fragrant, crispy finish. It’s my favorite way to introduce something new and delicious to my holiday table. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)

      <p>This Korean spicy braised chicken is a healthier, flavor-packed alternative to fried chicken. It’s tender, juicy and simmered in a rich gochujang-based sauce that’s comforting and gives a bit of a kick! Made in just one pot, this protein-rich meal comes together in under 40 minutes. —Tam To, Los Angeles, California</p>

      <h1>FOOD AND FAITH: MONASTIC GARDENS AND FASTING TRADITIONS IN IRELAND</h1>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>In medieval Ireland, monasteries were not only centers of prayer and learning but also hubs of agriculture, food preservation, and hospitality. The monks who lived within these sacred walls cultivated gardens, tended orchards, and managed fish ponds, ensuring that their communities were sustained by both the land and the sea. At the same time, strict rules of fasting and abstinence shaped how and when they ate, making food an essential part of their spiritual discipline as well as their survival. The story of Irish monastic foodways is one of balance—between nourishment and sacrifice, feasting and fasting, body and soul. These traditions, rooted in the rhythms of prayer and the agricultural year, influenced not only religious life but also the broader development of Irish cuisine. Many of the foods and practices first nurtured in monasteries would ripple outward, shaping Ireland’s food culture for centuries to come. Table of Contents Introduction: The Sacred Table The Monastic Gardens of Ireland Daily Meals in the Monasteries Fasting and Abstinence The Role of Fish and Dairy Legacy of Monastic Food Traditions The Sacred Table For monks, food was never simply about filling the stomach. It was an expression of community, humility, and devotion. Meals were eaten in silence, accompanied by scripture or readings from the lives of the saints. The ingredients grown and prepared by the monks reflected both the abundance of Ireland’s fertile land and the discipline of their faith. From carefully tended gardens to the long periods of fasting, food was a thread that connected daily life to spiritual purpose. The Monastic Gardens of Ireland Irish monasteries were more than centers of prayer—they were also models of self-sufficiency. At their heart lay the monastic gardens, carefully cultivated spaces where monks grew the food and medicine needed for daily life. These gardens were designed not for luxury but for survival, reflecting the Benedictine principle of “ora et labora”—pray and work. Monastic gardens typically included vegetables such as onions, leeks, beans, and cabbages, which provided the backbone of the monks’ simple diet. Herbs like parsley, sage, dill, and fennel served dual purposes, both seasoning food and providing remedies for common ailments. Fruit trees—especially apple and pear—were also planted, supplying fresh fruit in season and dried fruit for winter use. These gardens were more than just functional. They symbolized the order and harmony of creation, reflecting a spiritual discipline that saw tending plants as part of tending the soul. Every weed pulled and seed sown was an act of devotion, a reminder that labor in the earth was a form of prayer. In addition to the gardens, many monasteries maintained orchards, vineyards, and fish ponds. Orchards produced cider and preserved fruits, while fish ponds ensured a steady supply of food for fasting days. This combination of agriculture and aquaculture made monasteries uniquely resilient and influential in shaping Ireland’s early food culture. By cultivating the land so carefully, monks not only nourished their own communities but also influenced the surrounding villages. Knowledge of herbs, gardening techniques, and preservation methods often spread beyond monastic walls, embedding these traditions into Irish life for generations. Daily Meals in the Monasteries Life in an Irish monastery was guided by the rhythm of prayer, and meals reflected that same discipline. Daily meals were simple, communal, and always purposeful—meant to nourish the body without distracting the soul. Unlike the feasting traditions of kings and nobles, monastic dining emphasized moderation and humility. The staples of the monks’ diet included bread, porridge, beans, root vegetables, and dairy products. Meat was generally avoided, except on special feast days, and fish often took its place as a source of protein. Meals were eaten in a refectory, or dining hall, where silence was kept while one monk read passages from scripture or the lives of the saints aloud. This ensured that the act of eating remained spiritually grounded. Breakfast as we know it today was rare; instead, monks typically ate two modest meals a day. The first was taken late in the morning, after a morning of work and prayer, and the second in the evening. Portions were small but nourishing, balancing labor in the fields with the austerity of religious life. Hospitality was another essential part of the monastic table. Monasteries often welcomed travelers, pilgrims, and the poor, offering them food and shelter. While the monks themselves might eat sparingly, guests were sometimes given more generous meals, reflecting the Christian value of charity. This pattern of simple, structured eating helped create a culture where food was valued not for indulgence, but for sustenance and service. It laid the foundation for later Irish traditions that prized both communal meals and the spiritual symbolism of food. Fasting and Abstinence No aspect of monastic life shaped food traditions more than the practice of fasting and abstinence. For monks in medieval Ireland, meals were not only about nourishment but also about spiritual discipline, sacrifice, and solidarity with the poor. Fasting served as a way to purify the soul, train the will, and draw closer to God. The monastic calendar was filled with periods of fasting, especially during Lent, Advent, and on designated weekly days such as Wednesdays and Fridays. On these days, meat was strictly forbidden, and sometimes dairy and eggs as well. Meals were reduced to simple portions of bread, vegetables, and water. In some communities, only one meal was permitted during a fasting day. Abstinence shaped how certain foods became central to Irish monastic cooking. Fish, for example, took on an important role as a substitute for meat. This explains why many monasteries developed fish ponds and prioritized access to rivers and coastal waters. Similarly, pulses, grains, and root vegetables became the backbone of fasting meals, providing nourishment without indulgence. Fasting also reinforced a culture of humility. The lack of rich foods reminded monks that their true sustenance came from God, not the pleasures of the table. Even when feast days allowed for more elaborate meals, the contrast with fasting days ensured that celebration never slipped into gluttony.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>Description: This Irish-inspired dessert gives a modern twist to traditional bread pudding by using soda bread as the base. Combined with tart rhubarb and warming ginger, it creates a comforting pudding with a balance of sweet, tangy, and spicy flavors. Preparation Time: 20 minutesCooking Time: 40 minutesServing Size: Serves 6–8 Ingredients 300g (10 oz) soda bread, cut into cubes 250g (9 oz) rhubarb, chopped 75g (⅓ cup) sugar (plus 1 tbsp extra) 1 tsp ground ginger ½ tsp ground cinnamon 3 large eggs 400ml (1 ⅔ cups) whole milk 150ml (⅔ cup) double cream 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tbsp crystallized ginger, finely chopped Butter, for greasing Instructions Step 1 – Prepare the Rhubarb Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Toss rhubarb with 1 tbsp sugar, ginger, and cinnamon. Set aside. Step 2 – Arrange the Bread Grease a medium baking dish. Place half of the soda bread cubes at the bottom, followed by half of the rhubarb mixture. Repeat with the remaining bread and rhubarb. Step 3 – Make the Custard In a bowl, whisk eggs, sugar, milk, cream, and vanilla until smooth. Pour evenly over the bread and rhubarb. Press down lightly to help the bread soak up the custard. Step 4 – Bake Sprinkle chopped crystallized ginger over the top. Bake for 35–40 minutes until golden brown and the custard is set. Step 5 – Serve Allow to cool slightly before serving.

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>If you’ve ever made pot roast, you can make short ribs because beef is beef! The rich short ribs simmer low and slow until they're fall-apart tender. Toss in buttery noodles, savory mushrooms and a splash of cream to create a velvety stroganoff sauce, and you’ve got the ultimate comfort meal, all in one pot. —Alex Bala, Longmont, Colorado</p>

      <h1>FORGOTTEN IRISH BREAKFAST ITEMS YOU’LL RARELY SEE TODAY</h1>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>When people think of an Irish breakfast, the image that usually comes to mind is the hearty Full Irish: sausages, rashers, black and white pudding, fried eggs, tomatoes, and toast, all washed down with a strong cup of tea. But the breakfasts of Ireland’s past were far more varied—and often far more unusual—than what we find on the plate today. For centuries, Irish breakfasts were shaped by necessity, seasonality, and the rural rhythms of life. Farmers and laborers needed fuel for long days, and meals were built around what was available locally—oats, potatoes, dairy, and occasionally fish or offal. While some of these foods have faded into obscurity, they provide a fascinating glimpse into Ireland’s culinary heritage. Table of Contents Introduction: More Than the Full Irish Stirabout (Oatmeal Gruel) Tripe and Drisheen Boxty Cakes Fish and Seasonal Bakes More Than the Full Irish The Full Irish is a relatively modern standardization of the Irish breakfast, but older generations began their day with meals that reflected resourcefulness and regional traditions. From stirabout, a thick oat gruel that predates the potato, to fried herrings on the coast, to potato-and-apple cakes cooked on a griddle, Irish breakfasts of the past were diverse, filling, and deeply tied to the land. Stirabout (Oatmeal Gruel) Long before the potato became Ireland’s staple, oats were the cornerstone of the Irish diet. One of the most common ways they were eaten was as stirabout, a simple but filling oat gruel that served as the primary breakfast for centuries. Made by boiling coarse oatmeal in water or milk, stirabout was hearty, inexpensive, and capable of sustaining farmers through long hours in the fields. Unlike today’s creamy porridge, stirabout had a much thicker texture. It was often poured into a dish, left to cool and set, then sliced into wedges that could be carried to work and eaten cold. Families might sweeten it with a little honey or treacle when available, though more often it was eaten plain, sometimes with a splash of buttermilk on top. Stirabout’s popularity stemmed from its practicality. Oats grew well in Ireland’s damp climate, and the dish could be made in large quantities to feed an entire household. It was a breakfast that combined nourishment with economy, reflecting the resourcefulness of rural life. Today, while porridge remains common in Irish homes, traditional stirabout has largely disappeared. Its dense, rustic form has been replaced by smoother, creamier versions better suited to modern tastes. Yet stirabout stands as a reminder of how the simplest foods once provided the strength to fuel Ireland’s working classes. Tripe and Drisheen Of all the forgotten Irish breakfast items, few are as unusual to modern palates as tripe and drisheen. Once a common dish in Cork and parts of Munster, this combination of offal-based foods was both nourishing and inexpensive, making it a staple for working-class families. Tripe refers to the lining of a cow’s stomach, typically cleaned, boiled, and served in milk with onions. It was soft, mild, and filling—though its texture made it an acquired taste. Drisheen, on the other hand, was a type of blood pudding unique to the region, made from cow’s blood, milk, and herbs, encased in natural casing and boiled. Together, tripe and drisheen formed a hearty breakfast, packed with protein and iron, that sustained laborers through demanding days. For many families in Cork, it was a beloved local tradition, often purchased from butchers who specialized in preparing both elements of the dish. Today, tripe and drisheen have almost entirely vanished from breakfast tables, surviving only in niche food festivals or as a curiosity in discussions of Ireland’s culinary past. To the modern diner, the thought of offal for breakfast may seem unusual, but for generations, it was both a necessity and a comfort food. The decline of this dish reflects broader changes in Irish diets. As incomes rose and global food trends spread, offal lost its place at the center of the table. Still, tripe and drisheen remain an important part of Ireland’s food heritage—a reminder of how resourcefulness shaped everyday meals. Boxty Cakes Few traditional foods are as versatile as boxty, the Irish potato pancake. While today it is often served in restaurants as a rustic side dish or novelty item, boxty was once a common breakfast staple, especially in the midlands and northwestern counties. Easy to prepare and filling, it was the perfect way to use up leftover potatoes. Boxty came in many forms: grated raw potato mixed with mashed potato and flour to make a batter fried on a griddle, or shaped into cakes and baked or boiled. For breakfast, boxty cakes were fried until crisp and golden, then eaten hot with a little butter, buttermilk, or even a slice of bacon when available. The popularity of boxty reflected the central role of the potato in the Irish diet. Cheap, abundant, and endlessly adaptable, potatoes could be turned into a variety of dishes, and boxty was one of the simplest ways to transform them into a satisfying meal. Children on their way to school and farm laborers heading to the fields alike would have enjoyed boxty for breakfast. Though still celebrated at events like the annual Boxty Festival in Leitrim, the dish has largely disappeared from everyday breakfast menus. Today’s Irish breakfast tends to favor bread, cereal, or the standardized “Full Irish,” leaving boxty as more of a heritage food than a household staple. Yet boxty cakes remain an enduring symbol of Irish ingenuity—transforming the humble potato into a dish that carried families through lean times and busy mornings. Fish and Seasonal Bakes One of the biggest differences between traditional and modern Irish breakfasts is the role of fish. In coastal communities, it was once entirely normal to begin the day with herring, kippers, or mackerel, fried up in a pan and eaten with bread or potatoes. Cheap, plentiful, and full of protein, fish provided the energy needed for a day’s work at sea or on the land. Fried herring with</p>
