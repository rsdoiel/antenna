<h2 id="hetal-vasavadas-ice-cream-cake">Hetal Vasavada’s Ice Cream
Cake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Growing up, Carvel ice cream cake was the birthday centerpiece I
looked forward to all year! As an adult, I keep the tradition alive by
treating myself to a mini version on Valentine’s Day and savoring it
over a few days, one delicious slice at a time. This homemade cake
captures all the joy of the original with layers of no-churn chocolate
and vanilla ice cream, a generously thick band of chocolate crunchies,
and those unmistakable blue whipped cream scallops topped with rainbow
sprinkles. The clear vanilla extract in this recipe really gives you
that nostalgic vanilla birthday cake flavor. It’s a playful dessert that
feels celebratory and costs less than its store-bought counterpart.

<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>These garlic Parmesan shoestring fries might just ruin all other
fries for you. Ultra-thin and dangerously crispy, they’re fried to
golden perfection and absolutely drenched in garlicky, buttery goodness,
then buried under a snowfall of freshly grated Parmeggiano Reggiano. You
may never go back to basic fries. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles,
California</p>

<p>If you’re craving the bold, savory flavors of a classic Philly
cheesesteak but want something a little lighter for summer, these Philly
cheesesteak zucchini boats are the answer. I make them with tender
slices of NY strip steak and sauteed bell peppers, onions and mushrooms,
all tucked into roasted zucchini halves and topped with melted
provolone. It’s a healthy twist on the sandwich we know and love,
without sacrificing flavor. This dish is hearty, satisfying and
weeknight-friendly. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

<h2 id="curried-shepherds-pie">CURRIED SHEPHERD’S PIE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description:Curried Shepherd’s Pie adds an exciting twist to the beloved
Irish classic by infusing the filling with warm curry spices. Ground
lamb or beef is simmered with onions, carrots, peas, and curry powder,
then topped with creamy mashed potatoes and baked to golden perfection.
This dish brings cozy comfort food together with bold, aromatic flavor.
Preparation Time: 20 minutesCooking Time: 45 minutesServing Size: Serves
4–6 📝 Ingredients For the Filling: 500g (1 lb) ground lamb or beef 1
onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 carrots, diced 100g (¾
cup) frozen peas 2 tbsp curry powder (medium or mild) 1 tsp ground cumin
1 tbsp tomato paste 200ml (¾ cup) beef or vegetable stock 1 tbsp flour
(optional, for thickening) Salt and pepper to taste 1 tbsp vegetable oil
For the Mash Topping: 700g (1½ lbs) potatoes, peeled and chopped 50g (3
tbsp) butter 100ml (⅓ cup) milk Salt and pepper to taste 👨‍🍳 Instructions
Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Boil the potatoes in salted water for
15–20 minutes or until tender. Drain, mash with butter and milk, and
season to taste. Set aside. Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium
heat. Add onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until soft. Add garlic and
carrots and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the ground meat, breaking it
apart with a spoon. Cook until browned. Stir in curry powder, cumin, and
tomato paste. Cook for 1 minute to release the spices. Pour in the
stock, stir in the peas, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for
10–15 minutes until thickened (add flour if needed). Spoon the meat
mixture into a baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes on top and use a
fork to rough up the surface. Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes or
until the top is golden and slightly crisp. Let cool slightly before
serving. Garnish with chopped parsley or a sprinkle of curry powder if
desired. 🍽️ Serving Tip This curried version of shepherd’s pie pairs
well with mango chutney or a side of spiced green beans for an
Irish-Indian fusion meal.

<h2 id="guinness-osso-buco">GUINNESS OSSO BUCO</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description:Guinness Osso Buco is a bold Irish twist on the classic
Italian dish. Instead of white wine, this version uses the deep, malty
richness of Guinness stout to slow-braise veal or beef shanks until
meltingly tender. Perfect for hearty dinners or special occasions, it’s
traditionally served with mashed potatoes or creamy polenta to soak up
the flavorful gravy. Preparation Time: 20 minutesCooking Time: 2.5 to 3
hoursServing Size: Serves 4 📝 Ingredients 4 veal or beef shanks, about
2 inches thick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tbsp plain flour
(for dusting) 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp tomato paste 440ml
(1 can) Guinness stout 500ml beef stock 1 bay leaf 1 tsp fresh thyme
leaves (or ½ tsp dried) Zest of 1 lemon (optional, for gremolata) 2 tbsp
chopped fresh parsley (optional, for gremolata) 👨‍🍳 Instructions Preheat
oven to 160°C (320°F). Season the shanks with salt and pepper, then
lightly dust with flour. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over
medium-high heat. Brown the shanks on all sides, then transfer to a
plate. Add onions, carrots, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté until
softened, about 6–8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2
minutes. Pour in the Guinness and scrape up any browned bits from the
bottom of the pot. Add beef stock, bay leaf, and thyme. Return the
shanks to the pot, ensuring they’re mostly submerged in liquid. Cover
and place in the oven. Braise for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is
fall-off-the-bone tender. Optional: Mix lemon zest and parsley to make a
gremolata. Sprinkle over the dish just before serving for a fresh
contrast. Serve hot with mashed potatoes, polenta, or rustic bread. 🍽️
Serving Tip This dish pairs beautifully with extra Guinness or a bold
red wine, and makes an impressive centrepiece for a cold-weather dinner.

AND SOCIAL MEDIA’S INFLUENCE ON IRISH FOOD TRENDS – THE RISE OF VIRAL
FOOD CRAZES IN IRELAND</h2>

Creators, Micro-Influencers, and the Rise of Irish TikTok Chefs 4.
Social Media as a Launchpad for Local Irish Food Businesses 5. What’s
Next? Predicting the Future of Irish Food Trends Online The Digital
Kitchen: A New Era for Irish Food Once rooted firmly in the traditions
of family recipes and local food rituals, Irish cuisine is now
undergoing a digital transformation. Thanks to platforms like TikTok,
Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, a new food culture is emerging—one
that is faster, more visual, and highly influenced by trends born
online. This digital kitchen isn’t just changing how food is presented;
it’s changing what Irish people cook and eat. Young Irish creators and
food lovers are at the forefront of this movement, using smartphones
instead of cookbooks to guide their meals. Whether it’s whipping up a
viral butter board, perfecting an air-fried snack, or trying a
Korean-inspired garlic cheese bread, Irish kitchens are now places of
constant experimentation. Global food trends are being adapted to local
tastes—sometimes with surprising results. During the pandemic lockdowns,
interest in home cooking soared across Ireland, and TikTok emerged as a
culinary lifeline. With short, fast-paced videos showcasing unique
recipes and easy techniques, people of all ages began to explore food in
new ways. For many Irish families, dinner became less about tradition
and more about inspiration—from people halfway around the world. This
shift isn’t just about recipes. It’s about how food is talked about, how
it looks on camera, and how it fits into a lifestyle of sharing and
engagement. Hashtags like #IrishFoodTok and #EasyIrishRecipes now help
define what’s trending, and many content creators have gone from amateur
cooks to social media influencers, sparking new interest in Irish food
both at home and abroad. The digital kitchen has brought Irish food into
a global conversation—where a simple TikTok clip can launch a national
craving, and where what’s popular today might be gone tomorrow. In this
ever-changing space, food isn’t just eaten—it’s performed, recorded, and
shared. From Coddle to Cloud Bread: TikTok’s Influence on Irish Palates
For generations, traditional Irish meals like Dublin coddle, boxty, and
Irish stew were passed down through families with little variation. But
now, a new generation is blending these beloved dishes with internet
trends, creating mashups that are as surprising as they are shareable.
From air-fried potato farls to Guinness-infused ramen, TikTok has opened
the floodgates for culinary creativity in Irish homes. One of the most
noticeable changes is how global food crazes are being interpreted
through an Irish lens. When cloud bread went viral on TikTok—a fluffy,
meringue-like creation made with just egg whites, sugar, and
cornstarch—it wasn’t long before Irish versions began appearing,
sometimes dyed green or infused with local ingredients like Baileys or
Irish butter. Another example is the butter board, a viral
charcuterie-style trend where softened butter is spread across a board
and topped with sweet or savory ingredients. In Ireland, this trend
evolved into rustic farmhouse versions featuring Kerrygold butter, sea
salt flakes, fresh herbs, and even for dipping—turning a global fad into
a uniquely Irish bite. Even classic Irish breakfasts are being
reimagined. TikTok videos show everything from deconstructed breakfast
rolls to Irish-style breakfast tacos. The once-staple black pudding is
now being diced and added to pasta dishes, salad bowls, or even fusion
tacos that bring Irish flavours to life in completely new formats. This
creative spirit has also encouraged more experimentation with
plant-based and allergy-friendly alternatives. Vegan colcannon,
gluten-free soda bread, and dairy-free Irish coffee substitutes are
thriving in the algorithm-driven world of social media—giving
traditional dishes a modern, inclusive twist. As viral trends sweep
across the globe, Irish cooks are no longer passive observers. They’re
active participants—remixing food trends in a way that celebrates both
innovation and heritage. Food Creators, Micro-Influencers, and the Rise
of Irish TikTok Chefs The rise of Irish food content creators on TikTok
and Instagram has given a fresh face—and voice—to Irish cuisine. Gone
are the days when food media was controlled by a handful of celebrity
chefs or cookbook publishers. Today, a college student in Galway or a
home cook in Wexford can build a loyal following simply by sharing
relatable, mouthwatering content. These micro-influencers—many with just
a few thousand followers—often have more engagement than big-name
personalities. Their authenticity, local accents, and Irish kitchen
quirks make them instantly relatable. Whether they’re filming in a tiny
apartment or a countryside kitchen, these creators are making Irish food
feel both modern and deeply personal. Some focus on recreating childhood
favourites with a twist, while others highlight affordable meals for
students or busy families. You’ll find accounts dedicated to Irish
baking, air fryer meals, gluten-free options, and humorous takes on
nostalgic recipes like chicken curry chips or jambons. The common
thread? An eagerness to entertain, teach, and celebrate Irish food
culture in all its forms. Short-form video has proven particularly
effective. A 30-second clip showing how to make Tayto-crusted chicken
goujons can rack up hundreds of thousands of views in a weekend.
Hashtags like #IrishFoodie, #TikTokIreland, and #IrishRecipes connect
creators to a growing audience that’s hungry for something both familiar
and fresh. Some creators are even building full-time careers from their
content, launching cookbooks, collaborating with Irish food brands, or
offering cooking classes online. What began as a few cooking clips in
lockdown has blossomed into a dynamic food scene fueled by humour,
creativity, and community. It’s not just a trend—it’s a movement. And
these creators are leading the way in how Ireland sees, cooks, and
shares its food with the world. Social Media as a Launchpad for Local
Irish Food Businesses Social media isn’t just changing how Irish people
cook—it’s transforming how they launch and grow food businesses. From
market stalls to family-run cafés and home bakers, small Irish food
entrepreneurs are turning to TikTok and Instagram to reach audiences far
beyond their local
