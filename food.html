<h2 id="elise-jesses-chicken-tower">Elise Jesse’s Chicken Tower</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-15, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>This Mediterranean chicken tower is simple to make but delivers bold,
restaurant-worthy flavor. The marinade comes together in minutes using
pantry staples and fresh herbs, and the yogurt dressing can be made
ahead of time. The dish is stacked high like a centerpiece so it’s
perfect for dinner parties, allowing guests to carve as much or as
little as they’d like. To fill out the meal, serve the chicken over
rice, in wraps or with roasted veggies. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati,
Ohio</p>

Bread</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Why pay $6 for a loaf of sandwich bread when you can make one at home
for just $2.52? This soft, fluffy bread is my go-to for everything from
grilled cheese to French toast. It’s a one-bowl, no-fuss recipe that
uses instant yeast. Instant yeast doesn’t require blooming or warm
liquid, it’s cheaper than active dry yeast, and it has a much longer
shelf life. The bread gets its cloud-like texture from a triple proof,
which gives it extra time to develop gluten and build structure,
resulting in a softer, airier crumb. Each rise allows more gas to form
and stretches the dough gently, creating that pillowy texture you want
in a good sandwich bread. Brushing the loaf with melted butter before
and after baking gives it a golden crust and a glossy finish. It’s a
simple step that makes homemade bread taste (and look) bakery-level!

Introduction: Weddings as Feasts of Tradition The Ancient Wedding Table:
Pre-1800s Celebrations Victorian Influences and Rural Banquets
(1800s–Early 1900s) Modern Irish Wedding Menus: Local Meets Luxe Fusion
and Revival: How Old Traditions Are Returning Introduction: Weddings as
Feasts of Tradition Irish weddings have long been more than mere
ceremonies—they’ve been community events, celebrations of union and
continuity, and above all, feasts of abundance. Food has always played a
central role in these joyful gatherings, not just for sustenance but for
symbolism, hospitality, and festivity. From humble countryside spreads
to lavish banquet hall menus, the Irish wedding feast has evolved
alongside society. What was once a table of soda bread, lamb stew, and
poitín now often includes oysters, Champagne, and tiered cakes adorned
with edible gold. Yet through all the change, one thing remains
constant: food brings people together to honour love. Let us now take a
journey through Irish wedding cuisine—from ancient customs to the modern
farm-to-fork renaissance. Whether you’re planning your own Irish
celebration or simply curious about the cultural roots of these festive
meals, you’ll find plenty to feast on. The Ancient Wedding Table:
Pre-1800s Celebrations Before formal menus and printed invitations,
traditional Irish weddings—especially in rural and Gaelic
communities—were rooted in local customs, seasonal ingredients, and
sacred symbolism. The feast was often held in the home of the bride’s
family or in communal outdoor gatherings. What mattered most was not
refinement, but generosity and togetherness. Key Foods of Ancient Irish
Wedding Feasts Oatcakes and Brown Bread: Grain-based breads were
staples, often baked fresh by women in the family. Oats symbolized
fertility and prosperity. Boiled Meats and Broths: Meat, often mutton or
pork, was slow-cooked and shared. In leaner regions, salted fish might
take the place of fresh meat. Colcannon and Champ: Simple mashed potato
dishes with cabbage or scallions. These were considered hearty and
communal, ideal for large gatherings. Buttermilk and Ale: Rather than
wine, guests drank homemade mead, ale, or buttermilk—fermented beverages
with festive flair. Honey and Berries: Sweet treats were rare but
symbolic. Honey, in particular, was associated with abundance and became
the root of the “honeymoon” tradition. Customs Around the Table In early
Irish society, food was also spiritual. Bread might be blessed by a
family elder, and portions of the meal set aside for deceased ancestors.
There was no formal seating—guests gathered freely, with music and
storytelling flowing between dishes. Though the menu was simple by
modern standards, it was a deeply meaningful, rustic celebration of land
and kinship. These feasts were more about honouring life’s blessings
than displaying wealth. As Ireland entered the 19th century, the
structure of wedding celebrations changed—but many of these ancient
flavors and customs would linger for generations to come. Victorian
Influences and Rural Banquets (1800s–Early 1900s) As Ireland moved
through the 19th century, wedding traditions began to absorb Victorian
influences—especially in wealthier or urban households. At the same
time, in rural Ireland, time-honoured practices persisted. This era saw
a blend of rustic charm and rising aspiration, where weddings reflected
a family’s status and hospitality. Popular Dishes at Rural Irish
Weddings Roast Goose or Chicken: For families who could afford it,
poultry—especially goose—was a wedding-day delicacy, often served with
potatoes and root vegetables. Potato Farls and Boxty: These versatile
potato-based cakes were easy to prepare in large batches and could be
fried or baked. Stewed Rabbit or Mutton: Readily available meats like
rabbit were slow-cooked in hearty stews and served with thick gravy and
crusty bread. Apple Tart and Rhubarb Pie: Homemade fruit tarts became a
mainstay dessert, using what was seasonally available in cottage
gardens. Tea and Fruitcake: A Victorian influence that took root,
fruitcakes were rich, spiced, and often soaked in whiskey—an early
version of the Irish wedding cake we know today. Drink and Celebration
Whiskey became more central to Irish wedding feasts during this time,
especially for toasts. Tea—newly popularized—was served alongside
desserts, symbolizing both comfort and status. The feast might last all
day, especially in rural areas where guests walked or rode carts from
miles around. There were also unique customs such as the “bride’s
portion”—a plate of food saved for the bride while she mingled—and
dancing that often spilled out into courtyards or barns. The wedding
meal was not only nourishment but a statement of generosity and pride.
As the 20th century approached, more structured receptions would emerge,
but the heart of the Irish wedding feast—warmth, music, and local
food—remained firmly in place. Modern Irish Wedding Menus: Local Meets
Luxe Today’s Irish wedding feasts are a refined blend of tradition and
contemporary taste. Whether hosted in historic castles, boutique hotels,
or countryside estates, modern receptions emphasize quality,
presentation, and local ingredients. Couples often work with chefs to
design bespoke menus that reflect both heritage and personality. What’s
on the Menu Today? Starter Courses: Think smoked salmon on brown bread,
crab claws with garlic butter, wild mushroom soup, or goat cheese
tartlets with beetroot. Main Dishes: Rack of lamb, fillet of beef with
red wine jus, pan-seared hake, or vegetarian risotto made with Irish
blue cheese and seasonal veg. Accompaniments: Creamy mashed potatoes,
buttered baby carrots, roast root vegetables, and fresh sourdough rolls
are commonly served. Desserts: Individual pavlovas, chocolate fondants,
Baileys cheesecake, and apple tart with custard often top the list.
Drinks and Pairings Wine pairings are now standard, alongside Champagne
or prosecco for the toast. But Irish craft beers, gins, and whiskeys are
also having a moment—many couples offer a tasting tray of local spirits.
Mead has even made a comeback in artisan form, linking back to ancient
customs. The Irish Wedding Cake Fruitcake remains traditional for the
base layer, often soaked in whiskey and covered in almond paste and
fondant. However, modern cakes may include tiers of chocolate biscuit
cake, lemon sponge, or red velvet. Sugar flowers and Celtic patterns
offer

WITH SWEET POTATO MASH</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Vegan Shepherd’s Pie with Sweet Potato Mash – A Hearty Irish Comfort
Dish This Vegan Shepherd’s Pie with Sweet Potato Mash is a cozy,
plant-based twist on the traditional Irish classic. Lentils, carrots,
parsnips, and peas are simmered in a rich stout-infused gravy, then
topped with velvety sweet potato mash and baked until bubbling and
golden. It’s comforting, nourishing, and perfect for family dinners or
St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. Preparation Time: 20 minutes Cooking
Time: 40 minutes Serves: 4–6 people Ingredients For the Filling: 1 tbsp
olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 carrots,
diced 1 parsnip, diced 1 cup green or brown lentils (cooked) 1 cup
frozen peas 2 tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried) 1 cup
vegetable stock ½ cup vegan stout or dark ale (optional) Salt and pepper
to taste For the Sweet Potato Mash: 3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and
chopped 2 tbsp plant-based butter or olive oil ½ cup oat or almond milk
Salt to taste Instructions Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 190°C
(375°F). Cook the Sweet Potatoes: Boil sweet potatoes in salted water
for 15–20 minutes until soft. Drain and mash with vegan butter and plant
milk until smooth. Season to taste. Make the Filling: In a large pan,
heat olive oil. Sauté onion, garlic, carrots, and parsnip for 8–10
minutes until softened. Stir in tomato paste, thyme, lentils, peas,
vegetable stock, and stout. Simmer for 10 minutes until thickened.
Season with salt and pepper. Assemble the Pie: Pour the filling into a
baking dish. Spread mashed sweet potatoes evenly on top. Use a fork to
create ridges for extra crisping. Bake: Bake for 20–25 minutes until the
top is golden and the filling is bubbling at the edges. Let cool
slightly before serving. Serving Suggestions Serve this vegan shepherd’s
pie with a side of braised cabbage or Irish soda bread for a complete

homemade vegan black pudding. It’s comfort food that celebrates Irish
heritage while embracing a meatless lifestyle. Preparation Time: 25
minutes Cooking Time: 20 minutes Serves: 2 hearty portions Ingredients
For the Skillet: 6–8 cherry tomatoes 1 cup baked beans (store-bought or
homemade) 1 cup mushrooms (button or chestnut), sliced 1–2 tbsp olive

tempeh, sliced thin 1 tsp soy sauce + ½ tsp smoked paprika (for tempeh

beans (or mushrooms) 1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 2 tbsp water (egg replacer)
½ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp black pepper 1 tsp soy sauce ½ small onion,
finely diced 1 garlic clove, minced Oil for frying Instructions Make the
Vegan Black Pudding: Mash the beans or mushrooms in a bowl. Add oats,
flaxseed mixture, onion, garlic, spices, and soy sauce. Mix into a thick
paste. Form into small patties and fry in a lightly oiled pan for 4–5
minutes per side until crispy. Grill or Sear the Tempeh: Toss sliced
tempeh in soy sauce and smoked paprika. Fry in a hot pan until browned
on both sides. Cook the Veggies: In a skillet, sauté mushrooms with
olive oil and a pinch of salt. Roast or pan-sear cherry tomatoes until
softened and blistered. Crisp the Farls: Fry the potato farls or hash
browns until golden brown on both sides. Warm the Beans: Heat the baked
beans in a small saucepan or microwave until piping hot. Assemble and
Serve: Arrange all elements in a large skillet or individual plates.

Irish experience — vegan style! Serving Suggestions Pair this vegan
Irish breakfast with brown bread and a hot cup of tea or strong coffee.
