<h2 id="irish-wheaten-bread">IRISH WHEATEN BREAD</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Irish Wheaten Bread is a hearty, slightly sweet wholemeal
bread made with whole wheat flour, buttermilk, and baking soda. It has a
nutty flavor and dense texture, making it perfect for serving with
butter, jam, or alongside soups and stews. This traditional Irish bread
is quick to prepare, requiring no yeast or lengthy rising time.
Preparation Time: 10 minutesCooking Time: 40-45 minutesServing Size: 1
loaf (about 8-10 slices) Ingredients: 3 cups (360g) whole wheat flour 1
cup (120g) all-purpose flour 1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp brown
sugar (optional, for a touch of sweetness) 1 ¾ cups (420ml) buttermilk 2
tbsp rolled oats (for topping, optional) Instructions: Preheat Oven:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan
or line it with parchment paper. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing
bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda,
salt, and brown sugar (if using). Stir well to ensure the baking soda is
evenly distributed. Add Buttermilk: Make a well in the center of the dry
ingredients and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon or your
hands until the mixture comes together into a slightly sticky dough. Do
not overmix. Shape the Dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured
surface and gently shape it into a loaf to fit your pan. Alternatively,
you can shape it into a round loaf and place it on a baking sheet for a
more rustic look. Prepare for Baking: Place the dough in the prepared
loaf pan or on a baking sheet. If desired, sprinkle rolled oats on top
for texture. Cut a shallow cross or slash on the top of the loaf to help
it bake evenly. Bake: Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the bread is
golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If the top
browns too quickly, cover it loosely with foil. Cool: Remove the bread
from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes
before slicing. Serving Suggestions Serve warm with Irish butter,
homemade jam, or honey. Pair with soups, stews, or smoked salmon for a
classic Irish meal. Toast slices for a hearty breakfast with cheese or
avocado.

<h2 id="coddled-pork-with-cider">CODDLED PORK WITH CIDER</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: This hearty Irish stew features tender pork chops gently
simmered with smoky bacon, root vegetables, and cabbage in a flavorful
cider and stock broth. The term “coddle” refers to the gentle simmering
method, resulting in a dish that’s both rustic and deeply satisfying.
Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 40 minutesServes: 2
Ingredients: 1 small knob of butter 2 pork loin chops 4 rashers of
smoked bacon, chopped 2 potatoes, cut into chunks 1 carrot, sliced ½
swede (rutabaga), diced ½ small cabbage, chopped 1 bay leaf 100ml Irish
cider 100ml chicken stock Instructions: Prep Ingredients: Chop the
bacon, potatoes, carrot, swede, and cabbage. Set aside. Brown the Pork:
Heat the butter in a large casserole dish over medium heat. Add the pork
chops and brown for 3–4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside. Cook the
Vegetables and Bacon: In the same dish, add the bacon, potatoes, carrot,
and swede. Sauté gently for 5–7 minutes until they begin to color. Stir
in the cabbage and cook for an additional 2–3 minutes. Assemble the
Stew: Nestle the browned pork chops on top of the vegetables. Add the
bay leaf, then pour in the cider and chicken stock. Simmer: Cover the
dish with a tight-fitting lid and simmer gently over low heat for 25–30
minutes, or until the pork is cooked through (internal temperature of
145°F/63°C) and the vegetables are tender. Serve: Remove the bay leaf
and serve hot, ideally with crusty Irish soda bread to soak up the
flavorful broth.
