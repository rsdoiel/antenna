      <h1>Elise Jesse’s Pineapple Habanero Dip</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/elise-jesse-pineapple-habanero-dip/">Taste of Home</a>)
      <p>
      This sweet and spicy pineapple habanero dip is a dupe for the popular Costco dip that's only sold in the summertime. Over here, we think this dip should be served all year long, so I had to recreate it. It’s a bold and creamy blend that’s perfect for parties, game days or any time you’re craving something with a kick to snack on. Fresh pineapple brings tropical brightness, while fiery habanero peppers add just the right amount of heat. Serve this dip warm with pita chips or veggies. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio
