<h2 id="spiced-beefcork-style">SPICED BEEF(CORK STYLE)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description Spiced Beef is a festive and flavorful delicacy from Cork,
traditionally enjoyed during Christmas but cherished year-round. The
beef is cured in a mixture of spices—like cloves, allspice, black
pepper, and sugar—then slow-cooked until tender. It’s usually served
cold, thinly sliced, and paired with crusty bread or mustard. Recipe
Summary Preparation Time: 20 minutes (plus 5–7 days curing time) Cooking
Time: 3–4 hours Serving Size: Serves 8–10 Ingredients For the Cure: 4–5
lb (2–2.5 kg) beef brisket (flat cut, well-trimmed) ½ cup brown sugar ½
cup coarse sea salt 1 tbsp cracked black pepper 1 tbsp whole allspice 1
tbsp whole cloves 1 tbsp juniper berries (optional) 1 tsp ground
cinnamon 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp ground ginger 4 garlic cloves,
crushed 1 bay leaf, crumbled For Cooking: 1 onion, quartered 1 carrot,
chopped 1 celery stalk, chopped Water to cover Instructions Prepare the
Spice Mix: In a bowl, mix all the curing ingredients together. Rub and
Cure: Rub the spice mixture thoroughly all over the beef. Place in a
large ziplock bag or non-metallic dish, cover, and refrigerate for 5 to
7 days. Turn the beef daily to ensure even curing. Rinse and Simmer:
After curing, rinse the beef under cold water to remove excess spices.
Place in a large pot with onion, carrot, and celery. Cover with water
and bring to a boil. Skim any foam, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook
Slowly: Simmer the beef for 3 to 4 hours until tender. You can use a
slow cooker on low for 8 hours as an alternative. Cool and Slice: Let
the beef cool in the broth. Once cooled, wrap and refrigerate until
firm. Slice thinly and serve cold. Serving Suggestions Serve with crusty
brown bread, mustard, or pickles. Excellent in sandwiches or as part of
a festive cold meat platter.

<h2 id="bannock">BANNOCK</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Bannock is a traditional flatbread made with oats or
barley, popular in Irish and Scottish heritage. It’s baked on a griddle
or in a skillet, giving it a lightly crisp exterior and a tender, hearty
center. Often enjoyed warm with butter, cheese, or jam, it makes a
comforting side to soups and stews. Preparation Time: 10 minutesCooking
Time: 15–20 minutesServing Size: Makes 6–8 wedges (serves 4)
Ingredients: 1½ cups oat flour (or finely ground oats) or barley flour ½
cup all-purpose flour (for better texture, optional) 1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt 2 tbsp cold butter, diced ¾ cup buttermilk (or milk with a
splash of lemon juice) Instructions Mix Dry Ingredients:In a large bowl,
whisk together the oat/barley flour, all-purpose flour (if using),
baking powder, and salt. Cut in the Butter:Add the diced butter and use
your fingertips or a pastry cutter to rub it into the flour until it
resembles coarse crumbs. Add the Liquid:Pour in the buttermilk and stir
gently just until a dough forms. Do not overmix. Shape the Dough:Turn
the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a round about ¾
inch thick. Score into 6–8 wedges. Cook the Bannock:Heat a heavy griddle
or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or
oil. Cook the bannock for 6–8 minutes on each side, or until golden and
cooked through. Serve Warm:Best enjoyed hot with a pat of butter, a
slice of sharp cheese, or a drizzle of honey.
