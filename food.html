<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>I love taco night, but sometimes I just need a break from the dishes.
Washing every little topping bowl used to hold me back from throwing
taco night until I decided to create a Taco Bouquet. I started making
this on vacation when I had minimal dishes to use, and I wanted to make
sure my little kids kept the floor clean. This simple method saved me
time, but didn’t sacrifice flavor. The unique cone shape keeps all the
toppings from falling out, making it an easy meal you can walk around
with at summer parties, too. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

<p>To pineapple or not to pineapple? That’s the question. For as long as
I can remember, people have argued about this—you either like pineapple
in your food or you don’t. But don’t knock it till you try this recipe.
It might just convert the non-believers! Or maybe it’ll confirm what you
already know. Who knows! Just give it a try. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles,

<h2 id="crubeens">CRUBEENS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Crubeens are boiled pig’s trotters, once a beloved pub
snack and street food in Ireland, particularly popular in the early to
mid-20th century. The name comes from the Irish word crúibín, meaning
“little hoof.” Traditionally eaten by hand and enjoyed with mustard or
vinegar, crubeens are prized for their rich, gelatinous texture and deep
pork flavour. While less common today, they remain a nostalgic and
culturally significant dish. Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time:
2½–3 hoursServing Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: 4–6 pig’s trotters
(cleaned and split if necessary) 1 onion, peeled and halved 2 carrots,
chopped 2 celery sticks, chopped 3–4 garlic cloves, crushed 2 bay leaves
6–8 black peppercorns Salt to taste Malt vinegar or mustard, for serving
Optional: crusty bread or mashed potatoes Instructions Clean the
TrottersRinse the pig’s trotters thoroughly under cold water. If they
still have hairs or bristles, scorch them off with a flame or scrape
carefully with a knife. Prepare the BrothPlace the trotters in a large
pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer
and skim off any scum. Add Vegetables and SeasoningAdd the onion,
carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Simmer
gently for 2½ to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and gelatinous and
starts to come away from the bone. ServeRemove the trotters from the pot
and allow them to cool slightly. Traditionally, crubeens are eaten by
hand, hot or cold, with mustard or vinegar. The broth can also be
strained and served as a rich soup base. Serving Suggestions: Pub-style:
Serve hot with mustard, vinegar, and a pint of stout. Homestyle:
Accompany with mashed potatoes or colcannon for a more filling meal.
Snack-style: Chill and slice into medallions to eat cold with pickles.

<h2 id="gooseberry-fool">GOOSEBERRY FOOL</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: A light and creamy traditional Irish dessert, Gooseberry
Fool blends the tartness of gooseberries with sweetened whipped cream or
custard. It dates back to the 15th century and remains a summer
favourite when gooseberries are in season. The balance of sharp fruit
and smooth cream makes it both refreshing and indulgent. Preparation
Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 10-15 minutesServing Size: Serves 4
Ingredients: 300g (10 oz) fresh gooseberries, topped and tailed 75g (⅓
cup) caster sugar (adjust to taste) 250ml (1 cup) double cream (heavy
cream) ½ tsp vanilla extract (optional) A few fresh mint leaves or
crushed biscuits for garnish (optional) Instructions: Cook the
GooseberriesPlace the gooseberries and sugar in a saucepan with 1–2
tablespoons of water.Simmer gently over low heat for 10–15 minutes, or
until the gooseberries have burst and softened into a compote. Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking. Cool the FruitOnce cooked, remove from
heat and allow to cool completely. For a smoother texture, you can purée
the mixture using a hand blender or press it through a sieve. Whip the
CreamIn a separate bowl, whip the cream and vanilla extract (if using)
until soft peaks form. Fold TogetherGently fold the cooled gooseberry
compote into the whipped cream. You can fully mix it for a uniform fool
or swirl for a marbled look. Chill and ServeSpoon into individual
serving glasses or bowls. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes
before serving. Optional GarnishTop with a sprig of mint, crushed ginger
biscuits, or a few whole cooked gooseberries for a lovely finish.

Vasavada’s Orange Creamsicle Tres Leches Cake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>This tres leches cake is my homage to the orange creamsicle, that
dreamy combo of citrus and vanilla I grew up loving every summer. I use
a lush, citrusy milk soak infused with oleo saccharum, a classic
technique from old-school punch recipes where sugar is massaged into
citrus peels to draw out their fragrant oils. It’s a simple trick that
adds incredible depth and natural orange flavor without a drop of
extract. It also makes sure that your tres leches mixture doesn’t
curdle. I take a little shortcut with the cake itself, using a box mix
boosted with extra eggs, milk instead of water, and butter instead of
oil for a richer sponge that soaks up all the orange-vanilla tres leches
milk. It’s nostalgic, bold and sunshiny in every bite. —Hetal Vasavada,
San Francisco, California</p>
