      <h1>Elise Jesse’s Pineapple Habanero Dip</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/elise-jesse-pineapple-habanero-dip/">Taste of Home</a>)
      <p>
      This sweet and spicy pineapple habanero dip is a dupe for the popular Costco dip that's only sold in the summertime. Over here, we think this dip should be served all year long, so I had to recreate it. It’s a bold and creamy blend that’s perfect for parties, game days or any time you’re craving something with a kick to snack on. Fresh pineapple brings tropical brightness, while fiery habanero peppers add just the right amount of heat. Serve this dip warm with pita chips or veggies. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio

(date: 2025-08-11, from: <a href="https://irishfoodhub.com/black-pudding-bao-buns/">Irish Food Hub</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Description: These soft, pillowy bao buns are filled with slices of rich, savoury Irish black pudding, crisp vegetables, and a tangy sauce for a delicious fusion of Irish and Asian flavours. Perfect for parties, street food nights, or as a creative twist on traditional black pudding dishes. Preparation Time: 25 minutes Cooking Time: 15 minutes Serving Size: Makes 8 bao buns Ingredients: 8 ready-made bao buns (steamed) 200g Irish black pudding, sliced into 1cm thick rounds 1 tbsp vegetable oil ½ cucumber, thinly sliced 1 medium carrot, julienned Small handful fresh coriander leaves 2 tbsp hoisin sauce (or sweet chilli sauce for extra kick) 1 tsp sesame seeds (optional, for garnish) Instructions: Cook the black pudding: Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add black pudding slices and cook for 2–3 minutes per side until crisp on the outside and heated through. Prepare the buns: Steam the bao buns according to package instructions until soft and fluffy. Assemble: Open each bao bun and spread a little hoisin sauce inside. Add a slice or two of black pudding, followed by cucumber, carrot, and a few coriander leaves. Garnish and serve: Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired, then serve immediately while warm. Tips: For extra flavour, lightly toast the sesame seeds before sprinkling over the buns. Try adding a few slices of pickled red onion for a tangy crunch. If making your own bao dough, allow extra preparation time for proving and steaming.</p>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: <a href="https://irishfoodhub.com/seaweed-pesto-pasta-2/">Irish Food Hub</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Description: This vibrant and nutrient-packed pasta dish combines the fresh, herby flavour of traditional pesto with the unique umami taste of Irish seaweed. Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner, it’s a delicious way to enjoy the health benefits of seaweed while adding a coastal twist to your meal. Preparation Time: 10 minutes Cooking Time: 12 minutes Serving Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: 350g spaghetti or linguine 2 tbsp dried Irish seaweed flakes (such as dillisk or wakame) 50g fresh basil leaves 50g toasted pine nuts (or walnuts) 2 cloves garlic 60g grated Parmesan cheese (or vegan alternative) 100ml extra virgin olive oil Juice of ½ lemon Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of cooking water before draining. Prepare the pesto: In a food processor, combine seaweed flakes, basil, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan, and lemon juice. Pulse until coarsely blended. Add the oil: With the processor running, slowly pour in olive oil until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine: Toss the drained pasta with the pesto, adding a splash of reserved cooking water if needed to loosen the sauce. Serve: Divide between bowls and garnish with extra Parmesan and a sprinkle of seaweed flakes if desired. Tips: For a dairy-free version, use nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan. Mix in some sautéed cherry tomatoes or roasted vegetables for extra colour and flavour. Use fresh chopped seaweed if available for an even more intense flavour.</p>

      <h1>YELLOWMAN: NORTHERN IRELAND’S UNIQUE HONEYCOMB TREAT – THE STORY OF THIS FAIRGROUND FAVORITE</h1>

      <p>Table of Contents Introduction: What Is Yellowman? A Sweet Tradition: The Origins of Yellowman Crafting the Perfect Crunch: How Yellowman Is Made Yellowman at the Auld Lammas Fair Preserving a Sugary Legacy in Modern Times Introduction: What Is Yellowman? If you’ve ever wandered through the bustling streets of Ballycastle in County Antrim during the late summer, you’ve likely seen stalls stacked high with golden, brittle slabs of a mysterious treat known as Yellowman. This crunchy, honeycomb-like confection has been a beloved feature of Northern Ireland’s fairgrounds and festivals for generations, instantly recognisable by its bright yellow hue and irresistible sugary aroma. Despite its name, Yellowman doesn’t contain honey—though its airy texture and caramelised sweetness might remind you of it. Instead, it’s a type of traditional boiled sugar sweet, similar in structure to honeycomb toffee or cinder toffee, but with a distinct flavour and appearance that make it uniquely Northern Irish. Made from a simple combination of sugar, golden syrup, vinegar, and bicarbonate of soda, the magic of Yellowman lies in the chemical reaction that causes the mixture to froth and harden into a crisp, bubbly texture. For many locals, the sight of Yellowman signals more than just a sugar rush—it evokes memories of childhood visits to the Auld Lammas Fair, where generations have snapped off shards of this golden treat from wax paper wrappers. Its nostalgic appeal continues to draw crowds year after year, connecting the present-day sweet tooth to centuries-old traditions. A Sweet Tradition: The Origins of Yellowman The exact origins of Yellowman are somewhat shrouded in mystery, much like many cherished regional treats passed down through generations. While similar honeycomb-style confections can be found in various cultures, Yellowman’s distinct name, bright colour, and strong association with Northern Ireland set it apart. It is most famously linked to the Auld Lammas Fair in Ballycastle, a festival that has been running for over 400 years and is one of the oldest traditional fairs in Ireland. Some food historians suggest that Yellowman may have evolved from older European sugar-boiling traditions, where caramelised sugar was aerated to create a light, brittle texture. As sugar became more accessible in the 19th and early 20th centuries, rural Irish sweet-makers may have adapted these methods, adding their own twist—including the signature golden-yellow colour that would make the confection stand out in crowded markets. Others believe the treat was initially made by local confectioners to attract children and visitors at seasonal fairs. Its low-cost ingredients, long shelf life, and eye-catching appearance made it ideal for selling in large quantities. Wrapped in greaseproof paper and sold in hefty slabs, Yellowman quickly became synonymous with festive gatherings in County Antrim and beyond. The name “Yellowman” itself likely emerged as a simple, descriptive term—referring to its striking colour and perhaps to the ‘man’ or vendor selling it at the fair. Over time, the treat gained an almost legendary status, with some families passing down their own guarded recipes, tweaking the balance of syrup, sugar, and aeration for the perfect crunch. By the mid-20th century, Yellowman had cemented its role as a cultural icon of Northern Irish fairs. Its history is not only about sugar and syrup—it’s about community, shared memories, and the enduring appeal of a humble yet delightful sweet that continues to bring people together. Crafting the Perfect Crunch: How Yellowman Is Made While Yellowman’s ingredients are simple, the magic lies in the method. At its heart, Yellowman is made from sugar, golden syrup, vinegar, and bicarbonate of soda. Yet, achieving the perfect texture—light, airy, and crisp without being too hard—requires skill, timing, and an understanding of the old-fashioned art of sugar boiling. The process begins by gently heating sugar and golden syrup in a large pan until they dissolve together into a thick, bubbling liquid. The vinegar is added next—not for flavour, but to help prevent the sugar from crystallising, ensuring a smooth, even texture. Once the mixture reaches the right temperature, the heat is removed, and the most important ingredient—bicarbonate of soda—is whisked in. This is the moment of transformation. The bicarbonate reacts with the hot syrup, releasing carbon dioxide and causing the mixture to foam dramatically. It’s this reaction that creates the network of tiny air bubbles, giving Yellowman its signature honeycomb texture. The frothy mixture is quickly poured onto a prepared surface or tray, where it’s left to cool and harden. Once set, the slab of Yellowman is broken into pieces—often with a satisfying crack. Traditionally, it’s wrapped in greaseproof or waxed paper to keep it fresh and to prevent the sticky edges from clumping together. Unlike chocolate-coated honeycomb found elsewhere, Yellowman is served plain, allowing its golden colour and pure caramelised flavour to shine. Homemade versions are still made in some Northern Irish kitchens, particularly around fair time, but most people enjoy it from market stalls, sweet shops, or specialty confectioners who have perfected their recipes over decades. The challenge lies in balancing the ingredients so the Yellowman is crunchy yet light, without being overly sticky or brittle. For those willing to try making it at home, caution is key—boiled sugar can cause serious burns, and precise timing is crucial to avoid undercooking or burning. But for those who master it, the reward is a truly authentic taste of Northern Ireland’s culinary heritage. Yellowman at the Auld Lammas Fair No discussion of Yellowman is complete without mentioning the Auld Lammas Fair in Ballycastle, County Antrim. Held annually on the last Monday and Tuesday of August, this centuries-old event is one of Ireland’s oldest traditional fairs, with roots stretching back over 400 years. Originally a harvest market where livestock, farm goods, and crafts were traded, it has evolved into a vibrant celebration of music, culture, and food—of which Yellowman is undoubtedly the star attraction. Stalls selling towering stacks of Yellowman line the streets during the fair. Vendors wrap the slabs in waxed paper, often weighing them out in generous portions. The sight of children clutching their golden sweets as they weave through the</p>
