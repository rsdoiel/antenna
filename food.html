Chicken Caesar Tacos</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce you to smash chicken Caesar tacos. Make this
recipe once, and you’ll be adding it to your weekly rotation like I
have. The seasoned ground chicken is smashed and cooked onto a warm,
crispy tortilla before it’s topped with chilled romaine, a creamy Greek
yogurt Caesar dressing, crunchy toasted bread crumbs and fresh Parmesan.
Think of it as your favorite Caesar salad turned into a cheesy,
flavorful taco. I love it for its simplicity, flavor and ease. —Elise
Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

Tropical Cocktail Cookies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Taste of Home</p>
<p>These tropical cocktail cookies are a fun twist on a classic sugar
cookie. The dough is infused with shredded coconut and coconut cream
powder, which adds texture and a rich natural coconut flavor. Coconut
cream powder can be found at Asian grocery stores or on Amazon. It’s a
great way to punch up the coconut flavor in baked goods! I like to
divide the batch of cookies and make two easy glazes: one with pineapple
juice for a sweet, fruity finish reminiscent of a pina colada, and the
other with lime juice for a bright, tangy kick. Using juice in glazes is
a great way to add real flavor without artificial extracts. —Hetal
Vasavada, San Francisco, California</p>

Ingredients and What Makes It Unique A Cake for All Seasons –
Celebrations, Holidays, and Daily Life The Modern Revival: Recipes,
Variations, and Twists From Ireland to the World – Cultural Legacy and
Emigrant Stories The Deep Roots of Porter Cake in Irish Kitchens Porter
Cake is not just a rich, spiced fruitcake—it’s a slice of Irish culinary
history that embodies the heart of home baking. Made with dark Irish
porter (most famously Guinness), it’s a loaf that tells the story of
frugality, festivity, and flavor, all rolled into one humble but
delicious package. Its origins are tied to the evolution of Irish
domestic baking in the 18th and 19th centuries. As porter-style beer
became widely available throughout Ireland—especially after the founding
of Guinness in 1759—home cooks began using it not only for drinking but
as an ingredient in hearty meals. Just as porter added body to beef
stews and depth to brown breads, it found a flavorful role in desserts.
Recipes for porter cake began appearing in Irish cookbooks and
handwritten family journals in the mid-1800s. These cakes were
originally baked for holidays, weddings, and religious festivals like
Easter or Christmas. Their popularity grew due to two key advantages:
they lasted for weeks without spoiling and actually tasted better with
time. In an age without refrigeration, this made them both practical and
celebratory. Unlike the more luxurious, brandy-soaked Christmas puddings
of the English gentry, porter cake was a cake for the people. It used
ingredients that were becoming more accessible to the rural Irish: dried
fruits imported through coastal ports, affordable brown sugar, and of
course, the ever-present porter that flowed from urban breweries into
countryside shops and pubs. What also made the cake stand out was its
texture—dense, moist, and deeply flavored. The porter infused the crumb
with a roasted maltiness that balanced the sweetness of the fruit.
Combined with warming spices like cloves, nutmeg, and mixed spice, it
created a loaf that was at once rich, rustic, and comforting. Many
grandmothers had their own version, and some were fiercely secretive
about the blend of spices or the exact brand of porter used. In some
areas of Ireland, the cake was baked in round tins and served like a
pie; in others, it was made in long rectangular loaf pans and sliced
generously for tea. Whether wrapped in parchment for a child’s school
lunch or offered to guests at wakes and weddings, Porter Cake had a
place in nearly every Irish home. Its longevity made it ideal for slow
weeks between shopping trips or for tucking into tins to share with
neighbors. In times of celebration or hardship, this cake remained—a
small but enduring comfort, often baked with love and memories in equal
measure.   Key Ingredients and What Makes It Unique At first glance,
Porter Cake might appear similar to other fruitcakes—but a closer look
reveals how its carefully chosen ingredients transform it into a
distinctively Irish creation. This is a recipe born from both
resourcefulness and flavor intuition, where every component plays a role
in achieving the cake’s dense texture and rich complexity. 1. Porter or
Stout – The Star Ingredient At the heart of every Porter Cake lies its
namesake: a dark, malty beer such as Guinness. Traditionally, Irish
porter was slightly sweeter and less bitter than stout, but modern
recipes often use either. The alcohol content helps preserve the cake,
while the roasted barley adds a deep, toasty flavor. When baked, porter
doesn’t leave the cake tasting boozy—it lends it a rounded, nutty base
that enhances the warmth of the spices and the richness of the fruit. 2.
Dried Fruits – Sweetness and Chew Irish home cooks made use of whatever
dried fruits were available—usually raisins, sultanas, and currants.
These fruits were sometimes soaked in porter before baking to help them
plump up and absorb flavor. The sweetness of the fruit balances the
slight bitterness of the beer, creating a harmonious flavor that deepens
as the cake rests. 3. Butter and Brown Sugar – The Moisture Makers
Unlike some drier fruitcakes, Porter Cake is rich and tender, thanks to
generous quantities of real Irish butter. Brown sugar is preferred over
white, as it adds molasses notes that echo the beer’s malt. The fat and
sugar ensure that the cake stays moist for days—if not weeks—after
baking. 4. Flour and Raising Agent Most traditional recipes call for
plain flour and a modest amount of baking soda. The soda reacts with the
acidity in the porter to create a gentle rise—not enough to make the
cake airy, but just enough to avoid heaviness. The result is a close,
satisfying crumb that holds its shape when sliced. 5. Spices – Warming
and Aromatic Mixed spice—a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and
sometimes allspice or ginger—is what gives Porter Cake its signature
warmth. These spices reflect Ireland’s long history of importing
colonial goods through ports like Cork and Waterford. Over time, these
exotic flavors became essential to Irish festive baking. 6. Optional
Additions While purists might stick to the basics, many bakers add
extras like orange zest, chopped nuts (often almonds or hazelnuts), or
even a spoon of treacle for darker flavor. In some recipes, a splash of
Irish whiskey is added alongside the porter—especially around
Christmas—to enrich the festive feel. One of the most beautiful aspects
of Porter Cake is its flexibility. The foundation remains the same, but
each baker, each family, and each county in Ireland may add their own
signature flourish. The result? A cake that is both consistent and
customizable—ideal for tradition, yet open to innovation.   A Cake for
All Seasons – Celebrations, Holidays, and Daily Life Though it may have
humble roots, Porter Cake became a beloved centerpiece for many Irish
family traditions. Its rich flavor and long shelf life made it not only
practical but also ceremonial. In a country where feasting often
revolved around religious and

<h2 id="smoked-salmon-sushi-with-pickled-samphire">SMOKED SALMON SUSHI
WITH PICKLED SAMPHIRE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Irish Seafood Meets Japanese Style Smoked Salmon Sushi with Pickled
Samphire brings together the best of Irish coastal produce and Japanese
culinary technique. This fusion dish combines silky smoked Irish salmon
with vinegared sushi rice and a pop of briny freshness from pickled
samphire—a coastal vegetable native to Irish shores. It’s a fresh,
elegant appetizer or light meal that celebrates both tradition and
innovation. 🍽️ Serving Size Makes 24 sushi rolls (serves 4–6 as an
appetizer) ⏱️ Preparation Time 30 minutes (plus 30 minutes for rice
cooling) 🔥 Cooking Time 15 minutes Ingredients For the Sushi Rice: 1
cup sushi rice 1 1/4 cups water 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tbsp sugar 1/2 tsp
sea salt For the Rolls: 6 sheets of nori (seaweed) 200g thinly sliced
smoked Irish salmon 1/2 cup pickled samphire (see below) 1 cucumber,
julienned 1 ripe avocado, sliced Optional for Serving: Soy sauce Pickled
ginger Wasabi How to Make Pickled Samphire Bring a small pot of water to
a boil. Blanch 1/2 cup fresh samphire for 1 minute, then plunge into ice
water. Drain and place in a small jar with 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, 1
tbsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. Let sit for 30 minutes or refrigerate
overnight. Instructions Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the
water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a pot, bring to a boil, then
cover and reduce heat. Simmer for 10–12 minutes. Remove from heat and
let stand (covered) for 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, dissolve sugar
and salt in the rice vinegar over low heat. Stir into the rice and let
cool to room temperature. Lay a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat (or
parchment paper). Spread a thin layer of rice over the sheet, leaving a
1-inch gap at the top. Arrange smoked salmon, pickled samphire,
cucumber, and avocado in a line near the bottom edge of the rice. Roll
the sushi tightly using the mat, sealing the edge with a bit of water.
Slice each roll into 4–6 pieces using a wet, sharp knife. Repeat with
remaining ingredients. Serve immediately with soy sauce, ginger, and
wasabi if desired. Serving Tips This Irish-Japanese fusion sushi makes
an elegant party dish or starter. For a dramatic touch, serve with wild
sea herbs or edible flowers. For a more casual feel, pair it with a cold
glass of white wine or craft beer.

<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
A Traditional Irish Oatmeal Dessert Flummery is a historic Irish dessert
once beloved in country kitchens and urban homes alike. Made by soaking
oatmeal in water, straining it, and then sweetening the silky liquid,
this simple dish was known for being nourishing, economical, and
comforting. Though it faded from popularity, Flummery is making a quiet
comeback as people rediscover its wholesome texture and subtle
flavor—ideal as a light dessert or breakfast alternative. 🍽️ Serving
Size Serves 4 ⏱️ Preparation Time 10 minutes (plus overnight steeping)
🔥 Cooking Time 15 minutes Ingredients 1 cup rolled oats (or pinhead
oatmeal for a more traditional texture) 2 cups cold water (plus extra if
needed) 1 tbsp brown sugar or honey (adjust to taste) 1 pinch of sea
salt Optional: fresh cream, cinnamon, or berry compote for serving
Instructions Place the oats in a bowl and cover with 2 cups of cold
water. Stir, cover, and leave to steep overnight (8–12 hours). The next
day, stir the mixture again and strain through a fine sieve or muslin
cloth into a saucepan, pressing the oats to extract as much liquid as
possible. Discard the oat solids or repurpose them in baking or compost.
Gently heat the strained liquid over medium-low heat, stirring
continuously until it thickens slightly—about 10–15 minutes. Add the
brown sugar (or honey) and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust sweetness
if needed. Once slightly thickened, remove from heat and pour into small
bowls or ramekins. Let it cool, then refrigerate for at least an hour
before serving. Garnish with cream, fruit, or spices if desired. Serving
Suggestions Traditionally served plain, Flummery also pairs beautifully
with fresh raspberries, stewed apples, or a drizzle of cream. Its gentle
taste and texture make it suitable for all ages, especially when served
slightly warm on colder days.
