The Fact And Fiction</h2>

Pepper seeds have a bad reputation, at least when it comes to hot
peppers. Many believe that the seeds can make a dish too hot, for
example. As we will find out below, that is not necessarily the case. We

<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Pepper Scale</p>
Ancho pepper is mild – merely a tickle on the taste buds in terms of
spiciness – but there’s plenty of flavor behind this Mexican chili. It’s
smoky, earthy, and a little sweet – all of which are perfectly paired
with the flavors in pumpkin. …
