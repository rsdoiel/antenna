      <h1>IRISH CRAFT SODA MAKERS: THE SPARKLING SIDE OF THE DRINKS SCENE</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Table of Contents Introduction: Ireland’s Sparkling Revival The Roots of Irish Soft Drinks Ireland’s Most Influential Craft Soda Makers Flavours Inspired by the Irish Landscape Where to Taste Irish Craft Sodas Today Ireland’s Sparkling Revival Across Ireland, a quiet but exciting shift is taking place in the world of soft drinks. Where once the shelves were dominated by familiar global brands, a new wave of Irish craft soda makers is bringing creativity, natural ingredients, and local flavour back to the fizzy drinks scene. These small-batch producers are redefining what a soda can be—less sugary, more botanical, and proudly rooted in Irish landscapes and traditions. This sparkling revival is driven by changing tastes. More people are seeking non-alcoholic options that still feel special, and Irish producers have responded with sodas infused with elderflower, rhubarb, lemon verbena, wild berries, sea salt, and botanicals gathered from hedgerows and gardens. Instead of artificial flavours or syrup-heavy formulas, these drinks celebrate real fruit, natural sweetness, and artisanal methods. But the movement isn’t just about flavour—it’s about identity. Craft soda makers often work closely with Irish growers, beekeepers, and foragers, turning local ingredients into refreshing drinks that tell a story. Whether enjoyed on their own or used as mixers for non-alcoholic cocktails, these sodas capture the brightness and creativity of modern Irish food culture. The Roots of Irish Soft Drinks Long before craft sodas became fashionable, Ireland had a distinctive soft drink culture shaped by mineral-rich springs, Victorian temperance movements, and rural home traditions. These early influences helped create a national fondness for sparkling beverages, many of which remain iconic today. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Ireland developed a reputation for its natural mineral wells. Places like Lisdoonvarna in County Clare and Lucan in County Dublin became known for their effervescent waters, believed to promote health and vitality. Local bottlers began capturing these naturally bubbly sources, laying the groundwork for Ireland’s soft drink trade. As bottling technology improved, small family-run companies across the country produced traditional lemonades, tonics, and sodas. These were often enjoyed at fairs, markets, and family gatherings. The famous “red lemonade”—a beloved Irish classic still found in shops today—became an iconic drink associated with childhood treats, pubs, and special occasions. Its exact origin remains a matter of folklore, but its popularity helped define Ireland’s soft drink identity. In rural homes, people also made their own natural sodas and cordials from elderflower, blackberries, rhubarb, and gooseberries. These homemade drinks often followed seasonal rhythms—elderflower in early summer, berries in late summer, and apples and herbs in autumn. Many of today’s craft soda makers draw directly from these traditional flavour profiles. By the mid-20th century, larger industrial brands dominated the market, and many small bottlers disappeared. But the memory of natural flavours, family-run soda works, and homemade cordials never faded. This nostalgia—and a renewed desire for authentic Irish ingredients—created the perfect backdrop for today’s craft soda revival. Ireland’s Most Influential Craft Soda Makers Across Ireland, a growing number of small-scale producers are transforming simple fizzy drinks into artisanal creations inspired by Irish landscapes, gardens, and traditional flavours. These craft soda makers are blending old-fashioned techniques with modern creativity, offering sodas that feel fresh, local, and genuinely unique. Here are some of the producers leading the sparkling renaissance. Wilde’s Irish Soda Co. Inspired by Ireland’s literary past and botanical heritage, Wilde’s creates elegant sodas infused with garden herbs, hedgerow botanicals, and real fruit. Their flavours—such as elderflower &amp; gooseberry, lemon verbena, and blackberry &amp; basil—reflect a commitment to natural ingredients and balanced sweetness. Each bottle feels like a taste of Irish summer, captured and carbonated. King of Kefir Based in Dublin, King of Kefir takes a different approach by offering naturally fermented probiotic sodas made with traditional water kefir grains. Their drinks are low-sugar, gently fizzy, and crafted with flavours such as ginger &amp; lemon, raspberry, hibiscus, and hopped citrus. They appeal to those seeking gut-friendly alternatives to conventional soft drinks while still enjoying vibrant, refreshing flavours. Poacher’s Irish Mixers Though known primarily for their premium mixers, Poacher’s has become influential in Ireland’s craft soda scene through their use of local botanicals and Irish spring water. Their citrus sodas, herb-infused tonics, and spiced ginger sodas are widely used in alcohol-free cocktails and across Ireland’s bars, cafés, and hotels. Poacher’s embodies the movement toward clean, crisp, naturally flavoured sparkling drinks. Longueville House Apple Soda In County Cork, Longueville House—famous for its orchard and brandy production—creates a beautifully simple apple soda using estate-grown fruit. Lightly sparkling and naturally sweet, it highlights the terroir of Irish orchards. This soda pairs especially well with cheeses, roast pork, and desserts, making it popular in farm shops and artisan markets. Regional Micro-Producers All around Ireland, small family operations and local innovators are experimenting with craft soda recipes. In Galway and Mayo, producers are turning to wild berries, rhubarb, and botanicals. In Wicklow, many sodas draw inspiration from the county’s gardens and beekeeping culture. In Donegal and Sligo, entrepreneurs craft sea-inspired blends using Atlantic salt, citrus, and herbs. Though diverse in style and scale, these producers share a common goal: to make fizzy drinks that feel rooted in Ireland—its fields, orchards, hedgerows, and coastal breezes. Their work has helped transform the Irish soft drink category into one of the most exciting corners of the modern food scene. Flavours Inspired by the Irish Landscape The magic of Irish craft sodas lies in their connection to the land. Rather than relying on artificial syrups or mass-produced flavourings, small Irish producers draw inspiration from hedgerows, orchards, gardens, and even the Atlantic coast. These natural ingredients bring a sense of place to every bottle and reflect the richness of Ireland’s culinary heritage. Hedgerow Berries Blackberries, elderberries, sloes, and rosehips are among Ireland’s most iconic wild flavours. Craft soda makers often turn to these fruits for their deep colour and natural tartness. A blackberry soda might echo childhood memories of foraging, while elderberry blends offer earthy, autumnal richness. Rosehip provides floral citrus notes that pair beautifully with</p>

      <h1>Elise Jesse’s Holiday Pizza Wreaths</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>If a flaky croissant and your favorite pizzeria had a baby, it would look and taste like these pizza bites. Made with buttery puff pastry and whatever toppings your heart desires, these little bites are crisp, gooey and absolutely impossible to stop eating. Think of these cutout pizza bites as a bagel bite upgrade. They are quick and easy to assemble, and they'll be a hit at your next party. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio</p>

      <h1>WINTER WARMERS: HEARTY IRISH STEWS AND SOUPS FOR THE COLD MONTHS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>When winter settles over Ireland—bringing Atlantic winds, long nights, and the familiar damp chill—there are few comforts as satisfying as a steaming bowl of stew or soup. For centuries, Irish households relied on hearty, slow-cooked pots of vegetables, root crops, and tender meats to carry them through the cold months. These dishes were not just meals; they were nourishment, warmth, and tradition served from one generation to the next. From the classic Irish stew of lamb and potatoes to the rich, peppery Coddle of Dublin, these recipes grew from necessity. They made use of what was available—root vegetables that stored well, preserved meats, and simple seasonings that brought depth to humble ingredients. Over time, each region and family added its own touch, creating a tapestry of winter comfort foods unique to Ireland. Today, these stews and soups remain a beloved part of Irish cuisine. Some are rustic and traditional, others reinvented by modern cooks who introduce new flavours while preserving the soul of the dish. But all share the same purpose: to warm the body, lift the spirit, and bring a taste of home during Ireland’s coldest days.

Some are rustic and traditional, others reinvented by modern cooks who introduce new flavours while preserving the soul of the dish. But all share the same purpose: to warm the body, lift the spirit, and bring a taste of home during Ireland’s coldest days. Traditional Irish Stews: From Lamb to Coddle Few dishes represent Ireland’s culinary heritage more deeply than its stews. Built on simplicity, resourcefulness, and the rhythm of rural life, Irish stews were designed to simmer slowly, stretch ingredients, and nourish families through long winters. Each region developed its own flavours and techniques, but the heart of Irish stew-making has always remained the same: wholesome ingredients cooked patiently until they become greater than the sum of their parts. Irish Lamb Stew The classic version of Irish stew features lamb or mutton, potatoes, onions, and carrots. Traditionally, tougher cuts—like shoulder or neck—were preferred because they softened beautifully with long cooking. Potatoes were layered in the pot, creating a starchy broth that thickened naturally as the stew simmered. Parsley or thyme added gentle flavour, while some cooks enriched the broth with barley or leeks. The result was a warm, filling dish that fueled farmers through cold winters and remains one of Ireland’s most beloved meals. (View our recipe) Dublin Coddle A uniquely Dublin creation, Coddle was born from practicality. It combines sliced pork sausages, rashers, potatoes, and onions, all gently simmered rather than browned. Coddle was often prepared when families wanted to use up ingredients before Friday fasting—hence its reputation as a Thursday-night supper. The broth is salty, savoury, and deeply comforting, especially when served with thick slices of soda bread to soak up the juices. (View our recipe) Beef and Guinness Stew Although more modern than its lamb-based cousin, Beef and Guinness stew has become an Irish favourite. Slow-cooked beef mingles with onions, carrots, and a generous pour of Guinness, which gives the broth its signature depth and dark richness. Long simmering softens the bitterness of the stout, leaving behind a velvety sauce that clings to every bite. It’s a staple in pubs during winter and a dish that showcases Ireland’s iconic brewing heritage. (View our recipe) Skillet or Fire-Side Stews In rural Ireland, many stews were once cooked in bastibles or cast-iron pots suspended over an open hearth. This slow, smoky style added earthy notes to simple ingredients like root vegetables, bacon pieces, or offcuts of meat. While less common today, the tradition lives on in rustic farmhouse cooking and outdoor gatherings where a pot over the fire still holds its timeless charm. Whether enjoyed in a Dublin pub or a quiet kitchen in the countryside, traditional Irish stews capture the essence of winter comfort—simple, hearty, and deeply tied to Ireland’s landscape and history. Hearty Soups That Warm the Soul Irish soups have long been a staple during cold months, offering nourishment, warmth, and a way to stretch ingredients when resources were limited. Built around root vegetables, grains, and simple broths, these soups brought deep comfort to rural households. Many were eaten with soda bread or oatcakes, making them filling enough to serve as a full meal. Today, they remain favourites for their rustic flavour and homely appeal. Potato and Leek Soup A classic across Ireland, potato and leek soup is smooth, creamy, and warming. Traditionally, it was made with just a few ingredients: potatoes, leeks, stock (often homemade), and a splash of milk or cream. Its mild, soothing flavour made it a winter essential. Modern versions sometimes add herbs like thyme, garlic, or a pat of butter for richness, but the soul of the dish remains unchanged—comfort in a bowl.

      <h1>POTATO AND DILLISK (SEAWEED) FRITTERS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>A Coastal Pub-Style Snack Description: These Potato &amp; Dillisk Fritters capture the flavours of Ireland’s coastal pubs. Golden, crispy, and flecked with savoury dried seaweed, they blend mashed potatoes with the briny taste of dillisk for a uniquely Irish snack that’s perfect with lemon and dipping sauce. Preparation Time: 20 minutesCooking Time: 15 minutesServing Size: Makes 10–12 fritters Ingredients 500g (about 3 medium) floury potatoes, peeled and diced 2 tbsp dried dillisk (dulse), crumbled 1 spring onion, finely sliced 1 large egg 3–4 tbsp plain flour ½ tsp baking powder Salt and black pepper, to taste Neutral oil for shallow frying Optional: 1 tsp lemon zest, ½ tsp smoked paprika, chopped fresh parsley Instructions Step 1 – Cook the Potatoes Boil the diced potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain thoroughly and mash while hot, allowing steam to escape so the mixture stays dry. Step 2 – Add Dillisk and Seasonings Stir in the crumbled dillisk, spring onion, salt, pepper, and any optional ingredients such as lemon zest. Step 3 – Bind the Mixture Add the egg and mix well. Sprinkle in the flour and baking powder until a thick, spoonable batter forms. Add a little extra flour if the mixture feels too loose. Step 4 – Fry the Fritters Heat a shallow layer of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan and gently flatten. Fry for 2–3 minutes per side until golden and crisp. Step 5 – Serve Drain the fritters on kitchen paper. Serve hot with lemon wedges and a dipping sauce such as garlic mayo or tartar. Tips A little dillisk goes far: It expands and intensifies as it hydrates in the warm potato mixture. Dry potatoes = crisp fritters: Letting the steam escape while mashing is key. Extra crunch: Lightly dust each fritter in flour before frying. Make-ahead: Form the fritter batter and refrigerate for up to 4 hours before cooking. Serving tip: A squeeze of lemon really lifts the seaweed flavour.</p>

      <h1>Alex Bala’s Crispy Potato Shrimp & Grits Minis</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Crispy, creamy, cheesy and loaded with flavor, these shrimp and grit bites turn a southern classic into a bite-sized showstopper. Each one starts with a golden potato base and is then topped with a velvety creamy grits sauce filled with savory ham and perfectly seasoned shrimp. These bites are perfect for brunch, holidays or whenever you want an appetizer that disappears instantly. —Alex Bala, Longmont, Colorado</p>

      <h1>Hetal Vasavada’s Peppermint Patty Thumbprint Cookies</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>If you’re a peppermint patty lover, you will adore these thumbprint cookies. There’s something about the combination of peppermint and dark chocolate that just feels like the holidays, and these thumbprint cookies lean all the way into that nostalgia. The base is a soft, black cocoa-rich cookie with just enough chew, but the real magic is the homemade peppermint patty filling nestled in the center. It’s creamy, cool and kind of like the inside of a York patty but richer. A quick drizzle of dark chocolate on top makes them look bakery-level without any extra fuss! These are the cookies you bring out when you want something classic but still a little extra. —Hetal Vasavada, San Francisco, California</p>

      <h1>WILD BERRIES OF IRELAND: RECIPES AND TRADITIONS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Across Ireland’s hedgerows, mountain slopes, and woodland edges, wild berries have ripened for thousands of years—feeding families, flavouring feasts, and inspiring folklore. From the juicy blackberries of late summer to the sharp sloes that signal autumn’s arrival, these berries form one of Ireland’s oldest natural food sources. They are reminders of seasons, stories, and skills passed down through generations. Long before supermarkets or sugar arrived on the island, Irish people relied on nature’s rhythms. Berries offered sweetness in an otherwise simple diet and were prized for preserves, drinks, remedies, and celebration foods. Picking them was not just a chore—it was a treasured ritual, especially for children who carried home purple-stained hands after rambling through brambles. Today, as interest in foraging and traditional foodways returns, Ireland’s wild berries are being rediscovered. Modern chefs use them in desserts and sauces, while home cooks revive old jams, syrups, and cordials. For many, gathering berries is still a moment of connection—to the land, the past, and the flavours that make Ireland unique. Table of Contents 1. Introduction: Ireland’s Wild Larder 2.

Where to Forage in Ireland Today Ireland’s Wild Larder Wild berries are one of Ireland’s most accessible and rewarding natural foods. They require no planting and no tending—only a season’s patience and a keen eye. For centuries, they were some of the few sweet treats available to rural families. Blackberry picking became an annual ritual, bilberries were gathered on windswept hills, and elderberries found their way into winter remedies and deep red cordials. These berries played important roles beyond the kitchen. They marked the changing seasons, featured in festival customs such as Lughnasa and Michaelmas, and held a place in folk medicine. Some were thought to protect against ill luck; others were believed dangerous to pick after certain dates. Their stories reveal Ireland’s long, intimate relationship with the land. A Guide to Ireland’s Native Wild Berries Ireland’s landscape is rich with wild berries—tiny bursts of flavour that mark the passing of summer into autumn. Each berry carries its own history, habitat, and traditional uses, forming a natural pantry that Irish families have relied on for centuries. From mountain heaths to hedgerows, here are the berries that have shaped Ireland’s seasonal food culture. Blackberries (Brambles) Perhaps the most iconic of Ireland’s wild berries, blackberries ripen from late August to October. Found in hedgerows, laneways, and woodland edges, they were once every child’s first foraging experience. Sweet, juicy, and intensely flavoured, they were used for pies, jams, stewed desserts, and simple eating straight from the bramble. Their abundance made them a vital seasonal food for rural families. Bilberries (Fraocháns) Known as fraocháns in Irish, these small dark-blue berries grow on low shrubs in upland areas, especially in Mayo, Donegal, and Wicklow. Traditionally gathered during Lughnasa celebrations, they were eaten fresh, baked into tarts, or mixed with cream. Their earthy, slightly tart flavour remains cherished in regions where bilberry traditions survive. Elderberries Elder trees offer two gifts: fragrant blossoms in early summer and rich purple berries in autumn. Elderberries were prized for syrups, tonics, and winter remedies due to their reputed immune-boosting properties. Cooked into jams or cordials, they brought deep colour and flavour to the Irish pantry. Raw elderberries should not be eaten, but when cooked they are wonderfully aromatic. Sloe Berries These dark, sharp berries grow on blackthorn bushes and are notoriously sour when raw. But after the first frost—or a spell in the freezer—they transform. Traditionally used to make sloe gin and hedgerow liqueurs, sloes steep beautifully with sugar and spirit, producing a warming drink cherished through the winter months. Hawberries Bright red hawthorn berries decorate hedgerows in early autumn. Though not naturally sweet, they were historically boiled into jellies or added to stews for colour and nutrition. In folk medicine, hawthorn was linked to heart health, and its berries, leaves, and blossoms were used in herbal remedies. Rowan Berries Once believed to protect against evil and misfortune, rowan berries are bright, bitter, and tart. They were cooked into sharp jellies—often served with game or lamb—and were valued for their high vitamin content. The rowan tree itself held deep symbolic meaning in Irish folklore. Wild Strawberries Tiny but intensely sweet, wild strawberries appear in early summer along woodland paths and grassy banks. Though too delicate for large harvests, they were treasured as early seasonal treats and sometimes preserved with honey in medieval kitchens. Their flavour is far more concentrated than the modern cultivated variety. Together, these berries form Ireland’s natural sweet store—small gifts from the land that inspired generations of cooks, healers, and storytellers. Each has its own flavour, season, and story, enriching the Irish table in ways both humble and extraordinary. Foraging Traditions and Folklore For centuries, the gathering of wild berries was woven into Ireland’s seasonal rhythms. It marked the turning of summer into autumn, brought communities together, and connected people to the land in ways both practical and magical. Every berry had its own traditions, superstitions, and stories—revealing a world where food was never just nourishment, but a part of the island’s living folklore. Blackberry Day (Michaelmas) One of Ireland’s best-known berry traditions surrounds the humble blackberry. According to folklore, blackberries should not be eaten after Michaelmas (29 September). The story goes that on this day, the devil was cast out of heaven and landed in a bramble bush. In anger, he spat—or, in some versions, stamped—on the berries, making those that ripened afterwards sour or spoiled. Rural families took this seriously, and blackberry picking became a cherished late-summer tradition, with children racing to collect the last of the season’s good fruit. Bilberries and Lughnasa Bilberries, known as fraocháns, were long associated with Lughnasa, the ancient festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. Families travelled to hilltops to gather bilberries, celebrate with music and dance, and mark the turning of the</p>
