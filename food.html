<h2 id="pork-and-apple-casserole">PORK AND APPLE CASSEROLE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: A heartwarming Irish-style casserole featuring tender pork
shoulder slow-cooked with sweet apples, caramelized onions, and crisp
cider. This rustic dish is full of comforting flavors and is best served
with buttery mashed potatoes or crusty bread. üïí Preparation Time 20
minutes üî• Cooking Time 2 hours 30 minutes üçΩÔ∏è Serving Size Serves 4 to 6
Ingredients 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) pork shoulder,
cut into chunks 2 large onions, sliced 2 apples, peeled, cored, and
sliced (Bramley or Granny Smith recommended) 2 garlic cloves, minced 300
ml (1 1/4 cups) dry Irish cider 250 ml (1 cup) chicken stock 1
tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard 1
teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves Salt and pepper to
taste Fresh thyme (for garnish, optional) Instructions Preheat your oven
to 160¬∞C (325¬∞F). Heat oil in a large, oven-safe casserole dish over
medium heat. Brown the pork in batches, removing each batch to a plate
once seared. Add onions to the dish and saut√© for 5‚Äì7 minutes until soft
and golden. Stir in garlic, apples, allspice, and cloves. Cook for
another 2‚Äì3 minutes. Return the pork to the dish. Add cider, chicken
stock, vinegar, and mustard. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a
gentle simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven. Bake for 2 to
2.5 hours, until the pork is tender and the flavors have melded
beautifully. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh thyme
before serving. Serve hot with mashed potatoes, creamy polenta, or
rustic bread. Serving Suggestion This dish is ideal for chilly evenings.
Serve it with a side of mashed potatoes or steamed greens to round out
the meal. For a festive twist, add a splash of brandy or a spoonful of
cream before serving. Tips Make it ahead and reheat ‚Äî the flavor
improves overnight! Swap pork shoulder with pork belly or loin for
variations in richness. To thicken the sauce before serving, remove the
lid for the last 30 minutes of baking.

<h2 id="gur-cake-dublin-fruit-slice">GUR CAKE (DUBLIN FRUIT SLICE)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Gur Cake is a traditional Dublin dessert, once sold in
bakeries as a thrifty treat for school children. It‚Äôs made from stale
bread or cake crumbs soaked and sweetened, then blended with dried fruit
and warm spices, all baked between two layers of shortcrust pastry. It‚Äôs
frugal, flavorful, and full of Irish character. üïí Preparation Time 30
minutes üî• Cooking Time 40‚Äì45 minutes üçΩÔ∏è Serving Size Makes 12 slices
Ingredients For the filling: 250g (9 oz) stale bread or cake crumbs
150ml (2/3 cup) strong tea or milk 100g (1/2 cup) soft brown sugar 150g
(1 cup) mixed dried fruit (raisins, sultanas, currants) 1 teaspoon mixed
spice 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon golden syrup or honey 1
tablespoon plain flour 1 egg, beaten For the pastry: 250g (2 cups) plain
flour 125g (1/2 cup) cold butter, cubed 2‚Äì3 tablespoons cold water Pinch
of salt Instructions Preheat your oven to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F). Grease and line
a 20cm x 30cm (8√ó12 inch) baking tin. Make the pastry: Rub the butter
into the flour and salt until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add water
gradually and bring the dough together. Chill while preparing the
filling. Prepare the filling: Soak the breadcrumbs or cake in tea/milk
until soft. Add sugar, dried fruit, spices, syrup, flour, and beaten
egg. Mix well to form a thick paste. Roll out half the pastry and line
the bottom of the baking tin. Spread the fruit mixture evenly over it.
Roll out the remaining pastry and lay it over the filling. Press gently
to seal the edges. Prick the top with a fork. Bake for 40‚Äì45 minutes
until the top is golden brown. Allow to cool in the tin. Cut into
squares or bars once fully cooled. Best enjoyed with a cup of tea!
Serving Suggestion Gur Cake is traditionally served cold, cut into bars
or squares. Perfect with a hot cup of tea or as a nostalgic afternoon
treat. Tips Use whatever bread or cake scraps you have ‚Äî the more mixed,
the richer the flavor. Let the filling rest before baking for deeper
flavor absorption. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
