Since March 19, five police operations linked to an investigation involving Istanbul Municipality have led to the arrest of 156 people. Following the detention and subsequent imprisonment of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, protests organized by CHP leader Ozgur Ozel took place in Sarachane, near the municipality’s headquarters building, marking the largest demonstrations the country has seen since the 2013 Gezi Park protests. Those rallies continued for days and later spread to other cities and districts. Imamoglu, seen as the main political rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, denies the charges against him, calling the investigations politically motivated. Political pressure on the main opposition CHP continues, with a court set to decide on September 8 whether to appoint a trustee to the party leadership. This morning, 157 people, including the former mayor of Izmir of CHP, were detained as part of a separate investigation into allegations of corruption and misconduct.
