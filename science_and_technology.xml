        <![CDATA[Bradford Morgan White has published an excellent retrospective of QNX, the realtime microkernel operating system focused on embedded use cases. The final paragraph made me sad, though. QNX is a fascinating operating system. It was extremely well designed from the start, and while it has been rewritten, the core ideas that allowed it survive for 45 years persist to this day. While I am sad that Photon was deprecated, the reasoning is sound. Most vendors using QNX either do not require a GUI, or they implement their own. For example, while Boston Dynamics uses QNX in their robots, they don’t really need Photon, and neither do SpaceX’s Falcon rockets. While cars certainly have displays, most vehicle makers desire their screen interfaces to have a unique look and feel. Of course, just stating these use cases of robots, rockets, and cars speaks to the incredible reliability and versatility of QNX. Better operating systems are possible, and QNX proves it. ↫ Bradford Morgan White at Abort Retry Fail Way back in 2004, before I even joined OSNews properly, I wrote about QNX as a desktop operating system, because back then I went through a short stint where I used QNX and its amazing Photon MicroGUI as my primary desktop. Back then, there was a short-lived but very enthusiastic community using QNX on desktops, sharing tips and findings, supported by one or two QNX employees who tried their best to support this fledgling community in the face of corporate indifference. Eventually, these QNX employees left the company, and QNX started making it clearer than ever that they were not, in any way, interested in people using QNX on desktops, and in all honesty, they were most likely correct. However, I still think we had something special there, and had QNX&#8217; management decided to help us out, it could&#8217;ve grown into something more sustainable. An open source QNX and Photon could&#8217;ve had an impact. Using QNX on the desktop back then was much easier than you might imagine, with graphical package managers, capable browsers and email clients, a massive pile of open source packages, pretty great performance, and little to no need to ever leave the GUI and use a CLI. If your hardware was properly supported, you could have a great experience. One of the very small &#8220;what-ifs&#8221; form the early 2000s.]]>

Anyway, what have the people behind this Rust-based operating system been up to this past month? One of the biggest changes this month is that Redox is now multithreaded by default, at least on x86 machines. Unsurprisingly, this can enable some serious performance gains. Also contributing to performance improvements this month is inode data inlining for small files, and the installation is now a lot faster too. LZ4 compression has been added to Redox, saving storage space and improving performance. As far as ports go, there&#8217;s a ton of new and improved ports, like OpenSSH, Nginx, PHP, Neovim, OpenSSL 3.x, and more. On top of that, there&#8217;s a long list of low-level kernel improvements, driver changes, and relibc improvements, changes to the main website, and so on.]]>

        <![CDATA[Google has been on a bit of a marketing blitz to try and counteract some of the negative feedback following its new developer verification requirement for Android applications, and while they&#8217;re using a lot of words, none of them seem to address the core concerns. It basically comes down to that they just don&#8217;t care about the consequences this new requirement has for projects like F-Droid, nor are they really bothered by any of the legitimate privacy concerns this whole thing raises. If this new requirement is implemented in its current form, F-Droid will simply not be able to continue to exist in its current form. F-Droid builds the applications in its repository themselves and signs them, and developer verification does not fit into that picture at all. F-Droid works this way to ensure its applications are built from the publicly available sources, so developers can&#8217;t sneak anything nefarious into any binaries they would otherwise be submitting themselves. The privacy angle doesn&#8217;t seem to bother Google much, either, which shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone. With this new requirement, Android application developers can simply no longer be anonymous, which has a variety of side-effects, not least of which is that anyone developing applications for, say, dissidents, can now no longer be anonymous. Google claims they won&#8217;t be sharing developer information with governments, but we all know that&#8217;s a load of bullshit, made all the more relevant after whatever the fuck this was. If you want to oppose the genocide in Gaza or warn people of ICE raids, and want to create an Android application to coordinate such efforts, you probably should not, and stick to more anonymous organising tools. Students and hobbyists are getting the short end of the stick, too, as Google&#8217;s promised program specifically for these two groups is incredibly limited. Yes, it waves the $25 fee, but that&#8217;s about the only positive here: Developers who register with Google as a student or hobbyist will face severe app distribution restrictions, namely a limit on the number of devices that can install their apps. To enforce this, any user wanting to install software from these developers must first retrieve a unique identifier from their device. The developer then has to input this identifier into the Android Developer Console to authorize that specific device for installation. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority Google does waive the requirement for developer certification for one particular type of user, and in doing so, highlights the only group of users Google truly cares about: enterprise users. Any application installed by an enterprise on managed devices will not need to have its developer certified. Google states that in this particular use case, the enterprise&#8217;s IT department is responsible for any security issues that may arise. Isn&#8217;t it funny how the only group of users who won&#8217;t have to deal with this nonsense are companies who pay Google tons of money for their enterprise tools? The only way we&#8217;re going to get out of this is if any governments step up and put a stop to this. We can safely assume the United States&#8217; government won&#8217;t be on our side &#8211; they&#8217;re too busy with their recurring idiotic song-and-dance anyway &#8211; so our only hope is the European Commission stepping in, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath. After all, Apple&#8217;s rules and regulations regarding installing applications outside of the App Store in the EU are not that different from what Google is going to do. While the EU is not happy with the details of Apple&#8217;s rules, their general gist seems to be okay with them. I&#8217;m afraid governments won&#8217;t be stepping in to stop this one.]]>

The judge states that Meta is indeed acting in violation of the law. He says that “a non‑persistent choice option for a recommendation system runs counter to the purpose of the DSA, which is to give users genuine autonomy, freedom of choice, and control over how information is presented to them.” The judge also concludes that the way Meta has designed its platforms constitutes “a significant disruption of the autonomy of Facebook and Instagram users.” The judge orders Meta to adjust its apps so that the user’s choice is preserved, even when the user navigates to another section or restarts the app. ↫ Bits of Freedom press release This is good news, of course, but I really wish we would take this a step further: a complete ban on targeted advertising and timeline manipulation based on harvested user data. I just don&#8217;t believe these business models and ragebait machines offer anything of value to society, and in fact, do far more harm than good.

        <![CDATA[With Google closing up Android at a rapid pace, there&#8217;s some renewed interest in mobile platforms that aren&#8217;t either iOS or Android, and one of those is Ubuntu Touch. It&#8217;s been steadily improving over the years under the stewardship of the UBports Foundation, and today they released Ubuntu Touch 24.04-1.0. Ubuntu Touch 24.04-1.0 is the first release of Ubuntu Touch which is based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, a major upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04. This might not be as big compared to our last upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04, but this still brings newer software stack to Ubuntu Touch (such as Qt 5.15). ↫ Ubuntu Touch 24.04-1.0 release announcement In this release, aside from the upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, there&#8217;s now also a light mode for the shell, including experimental support for switching themes on the fly. Applications already supported a light theme since the previous releases, so adding support for it in the main shell is a welcome improvement. We&#8217;ve also got experimental support for encrypting personal data, which needs to be enabled per device, which I think indicates not all devices support it. On top of that, there&#8217;s some changes to the phone application, and a slew of smaller fixes and improvements as well. The list of supported devices has grown as well, with the Fairphone 5 as the newcomer this release. The list is still relatively small, but to be fair to the project, it includes a number of popular devices, as well as a few that are still readily available. If you want to opt for running Ubuntu Touch as your smartphone platform, there&#8217;s definitely plenty of devices to choose from.]]>

      <title>Microsoft conducts Windows reorg that sees core engineering teams back under the same roof as feature experience teams</title>

        <![CDATA[Microsoft is reorganising the Windows teams. Again. For those unaware, the Windows organization has essentially been split in two since 2018. Teams that work on the core of Windows were moved under Azure, and the rest of the Windows team (those that focused on top level features and user experiences) remained under the Windows org. That is finally changing, with Davuluri saying that the Windows client and server teams are now going to operate under the same roof once again. &#8220;This change unifies Windows engineering work under a single organization &#8230; Moving the teams working on Windows client and server together into one organization brings focus to delivering against our priorities.&#8221; ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows Central I mean, it&#8217;s obviously far too simplistic to attribute Windows&#8217; many user-facing problems and failures on something as simple as this particular organisational split, but it sure does feel like it could be a contributing factor. It seems like the core of Windows is mostly fine and working pretty well, while the user experience is the ares that has suffered greatly in recent years, pressured as the Windows team seems to have been to add advertising, monetisation, tons of sometimes dangerous dark patterns, and more. I hope that bringing these two teams back together will eventually lead to an overall improvement of the Windows user experience, and not a deterioration of the core of the platform. In other words, that the core team lifts up the user experience team, instead of the user experience team dragging the core team down. A Windows that takes its users seriously and respects them could be a fine operating system to use, but it reorganisations like this take a long time to have any measurable effect. Of course, it could also just have no effect at all, or perhaps the rot has simply spread too far and wide. In a few years, depressing as it may seem, Windows 11 might be regarded as a highlight.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Have you ever heard of the Encore 91 computer system, developed and built by Encore Computer Corporation? I stumbled upon the name of this system on the website for the Macintosh like virtual window manager (MLVWM), an old X11 window manager designed to copy some of the look and feel of the classic Mac OS, and wanted to know more about it. An old website from what appears to be a reseller of the Encore 91 has a detailed description and sales pitch of the machine still online, and it&#8217;s a great read. The hardware architecture of the Encore 91 series is based on the Motorola high-performance 88100 25MHz RISC processor. A basic system is a highly integrated fully symmetrical single board multiprocessor. The single board includes two or four 88100 processors with supporting cache memory, 16 megabytes of shared main memory, two synchronous SCSI ports, an Ethernet port, 4 asynchronous ports, real-time clocks, timers, interrupts and a VME-64 bus interface. The VME-64 bus provides full compatibility with VME plus enhancements for greater throughput. Shared main memory may be expanded to 272 megabytes (mb) by adding up to four expansion cards. The expansion memory boards have the same high-speed access characteristics as local memory. ↫ Encore computing 91 system The Encore 91 ran a combination of AT&#38;T’s system V.3.2 UNIX and Encore’s POSIX-compliant MicroMPX real-time kernel, and would be followed by machines with more powerful processors in the 88xxx series, as well as machines based on the Alpha architecture. The company also created and sold its own modified RISC architecture, RSX, for which there are still some details available online. Bits and bobs of the company were spun off and sold off, and I don&#8217;t think much of the original company is still around today. Regardless, it&#8217;s an interesting system with an interesting history, but we&#8217;ll most likely never get to see oe in action &#8211; unless it turns up in some weird corner of the United States where the rare working examples of hardware like this invariably tends to end up.]]>

      <title>Google’s Android developer registration requirement will kill F-Droid</title>

        <![CDATA[The consequences of Google requiring developer certification to install Android applications, even outside of Google&#8217;s own Play Store, are starting to reverberate. F-Droid, probably the single most popular non-Google application repository for Android, has made it very clear that Google&#8217;s upcoming requirement is most likely going to mean the end of F-Droid. If it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree will end the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users will be left adrift, with no means to install — or even update their existing installed — applications. ↫ F-Droid&#8217;s blog post A potential loss of F-Droid would be a huge blow to anyone trying to run Android without Google&#8217;s applications and frameworks installed on their device. It&#8217;s pretty clear that Google is doing whatever it can to utterly destroy the Android Open Source Project, something I&#8217;ve been arguing is what the rumours about Google killing AOSP really mean. Why kill AOSP, when you can just make it utterly unusable and completely barren? Sadly, there isn&#8217;t much F-Droid can do. They&#8217;re proposing regulators the world over look at Google&#8217;s plans, and hopefully come to the conclusion that they&#8217;re anti-competitive. Specifically the European Union and the tools provided by the Digital Markets Act could prove useful here, but in the end, only if the will exists to use them can these tools be used in the first place. It&#8217;s dark times for the smartphone world right now, especially if you care about consumer rights and open source. iOS has always been deeply anti-consumer, and while the European Union has managed to soften some of the rough edges, nothing much has changed there. Android, on the other hand, had a thriving open source, Google-free community, but decision by decision, Google is beating it into submission and killing it off. The Android of yesteryear doesn&#8217;t exist anymore, and it&#8217;s making people who used to work on Android back during the good old times extremely sad. Jean-Baptiste Quéru, husband of OSNews&#8217; amazing and legendary previous managing editor Eugenia Loli-Queru, worded it like this a few days ago: All the tidbits of news about Android make me sad. I used to be part of the Android team. When I worked there, making the application ecosystem as open as the web was a goal. Releasing the Android source code as soon as something hit end-user devices was a goal. Being able to run your own build on actual consumer hardware was a goal. For a while after I left, there continued to be some momentum behind what I had pushed for. But, now, 12 years later, this seems to have all died. I am sad&#8230; ↫ Jean-Baptiste Quéru And so am I. Like any operating system, Android is far from perfect, but it was remarkable just how open it used to be. I guess good things just don&#8217;t survive once unbridled capitalism hits.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Unite is an operating system in which&#160;everything&#160;is a process, including the things that you normally would expect to be part of the kernel. The hard disk driver is a user process, so is the file system running on top of it. The namespace manager is a user process. The whole thing (in theory, see below) supports network transparency from the ground up, you can use resources of other nodes in the network just as easily as you can use local resources, just prefix them with the node ID. In the late 80’s, early 90’s I had a lot of time on my hands. While living in the Netherlands I’d run into the QNX operating system that was sold locally through a distributor. The distributors brother had need of a 386 version of that OS but Quantum Software, the producers of QNX didn’t want to release a 386 version. So I decided to write my own. ↫ Jacques Mattheij What a great story. Mattheij hasn&#8217;t done anthing or even looked at the code for this operating system he created in decades, but recently got the urge to fix it up and publish it online for all of us to see. Of course, resurrecting something this old and long untouched required some magic, and there&#8217;s still a few things which he simply just can&#8217;t get to work properly. I like how the included copy of vi is broken and adds random bits of garbage to files, and things like the mouse driver don&#8217;t work because it requires a COM port and the COM ports don&#8217;t seem to work in an emulated environment. Unite is modeled after QNX, so it uses a microkernel. It uses a stripped-down variant of the MINIX file system, only has one user but that user can run multiple sessions, and there&#8217;s a basic graphics mode with some goodies. Sadly, the graphics mode is problematic an requires some work to get going, and because you&#8217;ll need the COM ports to work to use it properly it&#8217;s a bit useless anyway at the moment. Regardless, it&#8217;s cool to see people going back to their old work and fixing it up to publish the code online.]]>

      <title>Another win for the Digital Markets Act: Microsoft gives truly free access to additional year of Windows 10 updates to EU users</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143429/another-win-for-the-digital-markets-act-microsoft-gives-truly-free-access-to-additional-year-of-windows-10-updates-to-eu-users/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A few months ago, Microsoft finally blinked and provided a way for Windows 10 users to gain &#8220;free&#8221; access to the Windows 10 Extended Security Update program. For regular users to gain access to this program, their options are to either pay around $30, pay 1000 Microsoft points, or to sign up for the Windows Backup application to synchronise their settings to Microsoft’s computers (the “cloud”). In other words, in order to get &#8220;free&#8221; access to extended security updates for Windows 10 after the 25 October end-of-support deadline, you have to start using OneDrive, and will have to start paying for additional storage since the base 5GB of OneDrive storage won&#8217;t be enough for backups. And we all know OneDrive is hell. Thanks to the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act, though, Microsoft has dropped the OneDrive requirement for users within the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). Citing the DMA, consumer rights organisations in the EU complained that Microsoft&#8217;s OneDrive requirement was in breach of EU law, and Microsoft has now given in. Of course, dropping the OneDrive requirement only applies to consumers in the EU/EEA; users in places with much weaker consumer protection legislation, like the United States, will not benefit from this move. Consumer rights organisations are lauding Microsoft&#8217;s move, but they&#8217;re not entirely satisfied just yet. The main point of contention is that the access to the Extended Security Update program is only valid for one year, which they consider too short. In a letter, Euroconsumers, one of the consumer rights organisations, details this issue. At the same time, several points from our original letter remain relevant. The ESU program is limited to one year, leaving devices that remain fully functional exposed to risk after October 13, 2026. Such a short-term measure falls short of what consumers can reasonably expect for a product that remains widely used and does not align with the spirit of the Digital Content Directive (DCD), nor the EU’s broader sustainable goals. Unlike previous operating system upgrades, which did not typically require new hardware, the move to Windows 11 does. This creates a huge additional burden for consumers, with some estimates suggesting that over 850 million active devices still rely on million Windows 10 and cannot be upgraded due to hardware requirements. By contrast, upgrades from Windows 7 or 8 to Windows 10 did not carry such limitations. ↫ Eurconsumer&#8217;s letter According to the group, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that Microsoft is much more aggressive in phasing out support for Windows 10 than for previous versions of Windows. Windows 10 is being taken behind the shed four years after the launch of Windows 11, while Windows XP and Windows 7 enjoyed 7-8 years. With how many people are still using Windows 10, often with no way to upgrade but buying new hardware, it&#8217;s odd that Microsoft is trying to kill it so quickly. In any event, we can chalk this up as another win for consumers in the European Union, with the Digital Markets Act once again creating better outcomes than in other regions of the world.]]>

        <![CDATA[If you download YouTube videos, there&#8217;s a real chance you&#8217;re using yt-dlp, the long-running and widely-used command-line program for downloading YouTube videos. Even if you&#8217;re not using it directly, many other tools for downloading YouTube videos are built on top of yt-dlp, and even some media players which offer YouTube playback use it in the background. Now, yt-dlp has always had a built-in basic JavaScript &#8220;interpreter&#8221;, but due to changes at YouTube, yt-dlp will soon require a proper JavaScript runtime in order to function. Up until now, yt-dlp has been able to use its&#160;built-in JavaScript &#8220;interpreter&#8221;&#160;to solve the JavaScript challenges that are required for YouTube downloads. But due to&#160;recent changes on YouTube&#8217;s end, the built-in JS interpreter will soon be insufficient for this purpose. The changes are so drastic that&#160;yt-dlp will need to leverage a proper JavaScript runtime in order to solve the JS challenges. ↫ Yt-dlp&#8217;s announcement on GitHub The yt-dlp team suggests using Deno, but compatibility with some alternatives has been added as well. The issue is that the &#8220;interpreter&#8221; yt-dlp already includes consists of a massive set of very complex regex patterns to solve JS challenges, and those are difficult to maintain and no longer sufficient, so a real runtime is necessary for YouTube downloads. Deno is advised because it&#8217;s entirely self-contained and sandboxed, and has no network or filesystem access of any kind. Deno also happens to be a single, portable executable. As time progresses, it seems yt-dlp is slowly growing into a web browser just to be able to download YouTube videos. I wonder what kind of barriers YouTube will throw up next, and what possible solutions from yt-dlp might look like.]]>

        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s no secret that Google wants to bring Android to laptops and desktops, and is even sacrificing Chrome OS to get there. It seems this effort is gaining some serious traction lately, as evidenced by a conversation between Rick Osterloh, Google&#8217;s SVP of platforms and devices, and Qualcomm&#8217;s CEO, Christiano Amon, during Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon Summit. Google may have just dropped its clearest hint yet that Android will soon power more than phones and tablets. At today’s Snapdragon Summit kickoff, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon and Google’s SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh discussed a new joint project that will directly impact personal computing. “In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we are building on PCs and what we are building on smartphones,” Osterloh said on stage. “We’ve embarked on a project to combine that. We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.” ↫ Adamya Sharma at Android Authority Amon eventually exclaimed that&#8217;s he&#8217;s seen the prototype devices, and that &#8220;it is incredible&#8221;. He added that &#8220;it delivers on the vision of convergence of mobile and PC. I cannot wait to have one.&#8221; Now, marketing nonsense aside, this further confirms that soon, you&#8217;ll be able to buy laptops running Android, and possibly even desktop systems running Android. The real question, though, is &#8211; would you want to? What&#8217;s the gain of buying an Android laptop over a traditional Windows or macOS laptop? Then there&#8217;s Google&#8217;s infamous fickle nature, launching and killing products seemingly randomly, without any clear long-term plans and commitments. Would you buy an expensive laptop running Android, knowing full well Google might discontinue or lose interest in its attempt to bring Android to laptops, leaving you with an unsupported device? I&#8217;m sire schools that bought into Chromebooks will gradually move over to the new Android laptops as Chrome OS features are merged into Android, but what about everyone else? I always welcome more players in the desktop space, and anything that can challenge Microsoft and Apple is welcome, but I&#8217;m just not sure if I have faith in Google sticking with it in the long run.]]>

      <title>Exploring GrapheneOS’ secure allocator: hardened malloc</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143413/exploring-grapheneos-secure-allocator-hardened-malloc/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[GrapheneOS is a security and privacy-focused mobile operating system based on a modified version of Android (AOSP). To enhance its protection, it integrates advanced security features, including its own memory allocator for libc: hardened malloc. Designed to be as robust as the operating system itself, this allocator specifically seeks to protect against memory corruption. This technical article details the internal workings of hardened malloc and the protection mechanisms it implements&#160;to prevent common memory corruption vulnerabilities. It is intended for a technical audience, particularly security researchers or exploit developers, who wish to gain an in-depth understanding of this&#160;allocator&#8217;s internals. ↫ Nicolas Stefanski at Synacktiv GrapheneOS is quite possibly the best way to keep your smartphone secure, and even law enforcement is not particularly amused that people are using it. If the choice is between security and convenience, GrapheneOS chooses security every time, and that&#8217;s the reason it&#8217;s favoured by many people who deeply care about (smartphone) security. The project&#8217;s social media accounts can be a bit&#8230; Much at times, but their dedication to security is without question, and if you want a secure smartphone, there&#8217;s really nowhere else to turn &#8211; unless you opt to trust the black box security approach from Apple. Sadly, GrapheneOS is effectively under attack not from criminals, but from Google itself. As Google tightens its grip on Android more and more, as we&#8217;ve been reporting on for years now, it will become ever harder for GrapheneOS to deliver the kind of security and fast update they&#8217;ve been able to deliver. I don&#8217;t know just how consequential Google&#8217;s increasing pressure is for GrapheneOS, but I doubt it&#8217;s making the lives of its developers any easier. It&#8217;s self-defeating, too; GrapheneOS has a long history of basically serving as a test best for highly advanced security features Google later implements for Android in general. A great example is the Memory Tagging Extension, a feature implemented by ARM in hardware, which GrapheneOS implements much more widely and extensively than Google does. This way, GrapheneOS users have basically been serving as testers to see if applications and other components experience any issues when using the feature, paving the way for Google to eventually, hopefully, follow in GrapheneOS&#8217; footsteps. Google benefits from GrapheneOS, and trying to restrict its ability to properly support devices and its access to updates is shortsighted.]]>

The thing I was working on yesterday were launcher builds, specifically a&#160;single&#160;download that supports both ARM64 and x64. I’d already gotten the game client itself running natively on ARM64, and it worked perfectly fine in my dev environment. I wrote all the new launcher code, am pretty sure I got it right. Zip it up, test it on ARM64, aaand… The game client crashes on Windows ARM64. Both in my VM and on Julian’s real Snapdragon X laptop. ↫ PJB at A stream of consciousness Debugging stories can be great fun to read, and this one is a prime example. Trust me, you&#8217;ll have no idea what the hell is going on here until you reach the very end, and it&#8217;s absolutely wild. Very few people are ever going to run into this exact same set of highly unlikely circumstances, but of course, with a platform as popular as Windows, someone was eventually bound to. Sidenote: the game in question looks quite interesting.]]>

        <![CDATA[I had the pleasure of going to RustConf 2025 in Seattle this year. During the conference, I met lots of new people, but in particular, I had the pleasure of spending a large portion of the conference hanging out with Jeremy Soller of Redox and System76. Eventually, we got chatting about EFI and bootloaders, and my contributions to&#160;PostmarketOS, and my experience booting EFI-based operating systems (Linux) on smartphones using&#160;U-Boot.&#160;Redox OS&#160;is also booted via EFI, and so the nerdsnipe began. Could I run Redox OS on my smartphone the same way I could run PostmarketOS Linux? Spoilers, yes. ↫ Paul Sajna The hoops required to get this to work are, unsurprisingly, quite daunting, but it turns out it&#8217;s entirely possible to run the ARM build of Redox on a Qualcomm-based smartphone. The big caveat here is that there&#8217;s not much you can actually do with it, because among the various missing drivers is the one for touch input, so once you arrive at Redox&#8217; login screen, you can&#8217;t go any further. Still, it&#8217;s quite impressive, and highlights both the amazing work done on the PostmarketOS/Linux side, as well as the Redox side.]]>

      <title>MV 950 Toy: an emulator of the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistor computer</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143402/mv-950-toy-an-emulator-of-the-metrovick-950-the-first-commercial-transistor-computer/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After researching the first commercial transistor computer, the British Metrovick 950, Nina Kalinina wrote an emulator, simple assembler, and some additional &#8220;toys&#8221; (her word) so we can enjoy this machine today. First, what, exactly, is the Metrovick 950? Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistor computer, is an early British computer, released in 1956. It is a direct descendant of the Manchester Baby (1948), the first electronic stored-program computer ever. ↫ Nina Kalinina The Baby, formally known as Small-Scale Experimental Machine, was a foundation for the Manchester Mark I (1949). Mark I found commercial success as the Ferranti Mark I. A few years later, Manchester University built a variant of Mark I that used magnetic drum memory instead of Williams tubes and transistors instead of valves. This computer was called the Manchester Transistor Computer (1955). Engineers from Metropolitan-Vickers released a streamlined, somewhat simplified version of the Transistor Computer as Metrovick 950. The emulator she developed is &#8220;only&#8221; compatible on a source code level, and emulates &#8220;the CPU, a teleprinter with a paper tape punch/reader, a magnetic tape storage device, and a plotter&#8221;, at 200-300 operations per second. It&#8217;s complete enough you can play Lunar Lander on it, because is a computer you can&#8217;t play games on really a computer? Nina didn&#8217;t just create this emulator and its related components, but also wrote a ton of documentation to help you understand the machine and to get started. There&#8217;s an introduction to programming and using the Metrovick 950 emulator, additional notes on programming the emulator, and much more. She also posted a long thread on Fedi with a ton more details and background information, which is a great read, as well. This is amazing work, and interesting not just to programmers interested in ancient computers, but also to historians and people who really put the retro in retrocomputing.]]>

      <title>Multikernel architecture proposed for Linux</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143398/multikernel-architecture-proposed-for-linux/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A very exciting set of kernel patches have just been proposed for the Linux kernel, adding multikernel support to Linux. This patch series introduces multikernel architecture support, enabling multiple independent kernel instances to coexist and communicate on a single physical machine. Each kernel instance can run on dedicated CPU cores while sharing the underlying hardware resources. ↫ Cong Wang on the LKML The idea is that you can run multiple instances of the Linux kernel on different CPU cores using kexec, with a dedicated IPI framework taking care of communication between these kernels. The benefits for fault isolation and security is obvious, and it supposedly uses less resources than running virtual machines through kvm and similar technologies. The main feature I&#8217;m interested in is that this would potentially allow for &#8220;kernel handover&#8221;, in which the system goes from using one kernel to the other. I wonder if this would make it possible to implement a system similar to what Android currently uses for updates, where new versions are installed alongside the one you&#8217;re running right now, with the system switching over to the new version upon reboot. If you could do something similar with this technology without even having to reboot, that would be quite amazing and a massive improvement to the update experience. It&#8217;s obviously just a proposal for now, and there will be much, much discussion to follow I&#8217;m sure, but the possibilities are definitely exciting.]]>

      <title>History of the GEM desktop environment</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143393/history-of-the-gem-desktop-environment/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The 1980s saw a flurry of graphical user interfaces pop up, almost all of them in some way made by people who got to see the work done by Xerox. Today&#8217;s topic is no exception &#8211; GEM was developed by Lee Jay Lorenzen, who worked at Xerox and wished to create a cheaper, less resource-intensive alternative to the Xerox Star, which he got to do at DRI after leaving Xerox. His work was then shown off to Atari, who were interested in using it. The entire situation was pretty hectic for a while: DRI’s graphics group worked on the PC version of GEM on MS-DOS; Atari developers were porting it to Apple Lisas running CP/M-68K; and Loveman was building GEMDOS. Against all odds, they succeeded. The operating system for Atari ST consisting of GEM running on top of GEMDOS was named TOS which simply meant “the operating system”, although many believed “T” actually stood for “Tramiel”. Atari 520 ST, soon nicknamed “Jackintosh”,&#160;was introduced at the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas&#160;and became an immediate hit. GEM ran smoothly on the powerful ST’s hardware, and there were no clones to worry about. Atari developed its branch of GEM independently of Digital Research until 1993, when the Atari ST line of computers was discontinued. ↫ Nemanja Trifunovic at Programming at the right level Other than through articles like these and the occasional virtual machine, I have no experience with the various failed graphical user interfaces of the 1980s, since I was too young at the time. Even from the current day, though, it&#8217;s easy to see how all of them can be traced back directly to the work done at Xerox, and just how much we owe to the people working there at the time. Now that the technology industry is as massive as it is, with the stakes being so high, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll ever see a place like Xerox PARC ever again. Everything is secretive now, and if a line of research doesn&#8217;t obviously lead to massive short-term gains, it&#8217;s canned before it even starts. The golden age of wild, random computer research without a profit motive is clearly behind us, and that&#8217;s sad.]]>

      <title>Dark patterns killed my wife’s Windows 11 installation</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143376/dark-patterns-killed-my-wifes-windows-11-installation/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Last night, my wife looks up from her computer, troubled. She tells me she can&#8217;t log into her computer running Windows 11, as every time she enters the PIN code to her account, the login screen throws up a cryptic error: &#8220;Your credentials could not be verified&#8221;. She&#8217;s using the correct PIN code, so that surely isn&#8217;t it. We opt for the gold standard in troubleshooting and perform a quick reboot, but that doesn&#8217;t fix it. My initial instinct is that since she&#8217;s using an online account instead of a local one, perhaps Microsoft is having some server issues? A quick check online indicates that no, Microsoft&#8217;s servers seem to be running fine, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t even know if that would have an effect on logging into Windows in the first place. The Windows 11 login screen does give us a link to click in case you forget your PIN code. Despite the fact the PIN code she&#8217;s entering is correct, we try to go through this process to see if it goes anywhere. This is where things really start to get weird. A few dialogs flash in and out of existence, until it&#8217;s showing us a dialog telling us to insert a security USB key of some sort, which we don&#8217;t have. Dismissing it gives us an option to try other login methods, including a basic password login. This, too, doesn&#8217;t work; just like with the PIN code, Windows 11 claims the accurate, correct password my wife is entering is invalid (just to be safe, we tested it by logging into her Microsoft account on her phone, which works just fine). In the account selection menu in the bottom-left, an ominous new account mysteriously appears: WsiAccount. The next option we try is to actually change the PIN code. This doesn&#8217;t work either. Windows wants us to use a second factor using my wife&#8217;s phone number, but this throws up another weird error, this time claiming the SMS service to send the code isn&#8217;t working. A quick check online once again confirms the service seems to be working just fine for everybody else. I&#8217;m starting to get really stumped and frustrated. Of course, during all of this, we&#8217;re both searching the web to find anything that might help us figure out what&#8217;s going on. None of our searches bring up anything useful, and none of our findings seem to be related to or match up with the issue we&#8217;re having. While she&#8217;s looking at her phone and I&#8217;m browsing on my Fedora/KDE PC next to hers, she quickly mentions she&#8217;s getting a notification that OneDrive is full, which is odd, since she doesn&#8217;t use OneDrive for anything. We take this up as a quick sidequest, and we check up on her OneDrive account on her phone. As OneDrive loads, our jaws drop in amazement: a big banner warning is telling her she&#8217;s using over 5500% of her 5GB free account. We look at each other and burst out laughing. We exchange some confused words, and then we realise what is going on: my wife just got a brand new Samsung Galaxy S25, and Samsung has some sort of deal with Microsoft to integrate its services into Samsung&#8217;s variant of Android. Perhaps during the process of transferring data and applications from her old to her new phone, OneDrive syncing got turned on? A quick trip to the Samsung Gallery application confirms our suspicions: the phone is synchronising over 280GB of photos and videos to OneDrive. My wife was never asked for consent to turn this feature on, so it must&#8217;ve been turned on by default. We quickly turn it off, delete the 280GB of photos and videos from OneDrive, and move on to the real issue at hand. Since nothing seems to work, and none of what we find online brings us any closer to what&#8217;s going on with her Windows 11 installation, we figured it&#8217;s time to bring out the big guns. For the sake of brevity, let&#8217;s run through the things we tried. Booting into safe mode doesn&#8217;t work; we get the same login problems. Trying to uninstall the latest updates, an option in WinRE, doesn&#8217;t work, and throws up an unspecified error. We try to use a restore point, but despite knowing for 100% certain the feature to periodically create restore points is enabled, the only available restore point is from 2022, and is located on a drive other than her root drive (or &#8220;C:\&#8221; in Windows parlance). Using the reset option in WinRE doesn&#8217;t work either, as it also throws up an error, this time about not having enough free space. I also walk through a few more complex suggestions, like a few manual registry hacks related to the original error using cmd.exe in WinRE. None of it yields any results. It&#8217;s now approaching midnight, and we need to get up early to drop the kids off at preschool, so I tell my wife I&#8217;ll reinstall her copy of Windows 11 tomorrow. We&#8217;re out of ideas. The next day, I decide to give it one last go before opting for the trouble of going through a reinstallation. The one idea I still have left is to enable the hidden administrator account in Windows 11, which gives you password-free access to what is basically Windows&#8217; root account. It involves booting into WinRE, loading up cmd.exe, and replacing utilman.exe in system32 with cmd.exe: If you then proceed to boot into Windows 11 and click on the Accessibility icon in the bottom-right, it will open &#8220;utilman.exe&#8221;, but since that&#8217;s just cmd.exe with the utilman.exe name, you get a command prompt to work with, right on the login screen. From here, you can launch regedit, find the correct key, change a REG_BINARY, save, and reboot. At the login screen, you&#8217;ll see a new &#8220;adminstrator&#8221; account with full access to your computer. During the various reboots, I do some more web searching, and I stumble upon a post on]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Intel is in very dire straits, and as such, the company needs investments and partnerships more than anything. Today, NVIDIA and Intel announced just such a partnership, in which NVIDIA will invest $5 billion into the troubled chip giant, while the two companies will develop products that combine Intel&#8217;s x86 processors with NVIDIA&#8217;s GPUs. For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs. ↫ NVIDIA press release My immediate reaction to this news was to worry about the future of Intel&#8217;s ARC graphics efforts. Just as the latest crop of their ARC GPUs have received a ton of good press and positive feedback, with some of their cards becoming the go-to suggestion for a budget-friendly but almost on-par alternative to offerings from NVIDIA and AMD, it would be a huge blow to user choice and competition if Intel were to abandon the effort. I think this news pretty much spells the end for the ARC graphics effort. Making dedicated GPUs able to compete with AMD and NVIDIA must come at a pretty big financial cost for Intel, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they&#8217;ve been itching to find an excuse to can the whole project. With NVIDIA GPUs fulfilling the role of more powerful integrated GPUs, all Intel really needs is a skeleton crew developing the basic integrated GPUs for cheaper and non-gaming oriented devices, which would be a lot cheaper to maintain. For just $5 billion dollars, NVIDIA most likely just eliminated a budding competitor in the GPU space. That&#8217;s cheap.]]>

      <title>GNOME 49 released</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143369/gnome-49-released/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[GNOME 49 has been released, and it&#8217;s got a lot of nice updates, improvements, and fixes for everyone. GNOME 49 finally replaces the ageing Totem video player with Showtime, and Evince, GNOME&#8217;s document viewer, is replaced by the new Papers. Both of these new applications bring a modern GTK4 user interface to replace their older GTK3 counterparts. Papers supports a ton of both document-oriented as well as comic book formats, and has annotation features. We&#8217;ve already touched on the extensive accessibility improvements in GNOME Calendar, but other applications have been improved as well, such as Maps, Software, and Web. Software&#8217;s improvements focus on improving the application&#8217;s performance, especially when dealing with Flatpaks from Flathub, while Web, GNOME&#8217;s web browser, comes with improved ad blocking and optional regional blocklists, better bookmark management, improved security features, and more. The remote desktop experience also saw a lot of work, with multitouch input support, extended virtual monitors, and relative mouse input. For developers, GNOME 49 comes with the new GTK 4.20, the latest version of Glib, and Libadwaita 1.8, released only a few days ago. It brings a brand new shortcuts information dialog as its most user-facing feature, on top of a whole bunch of other, developer-oriented features. GNOME 49 will find its way to your distribution of choice soon enough.]]>

        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s 2025, and yes, you can still install and run a modern Linux distribution like Debian through a real hardware terminal. While I have used a terminal with the Pi, I’ve never before used it as a serial&#160;console&#160;all the way from early boot, and I have never installed Debian using the terminal to run the installer. A serial terminal gives you a login prompt. A serial console gives you access to kernel messages, the initrd environment, and sometimes even the bootloader. This might be fun, I thought. ↫ John Goerzen at The Changelog It seems Debian does a lot of the correct configurations for you, but there&#8217;s still a few things you&#8217;ll need to manually change, but none of it seems particularly complicated. Once the installation is completed, you have a system that&#8217;s completely accessible and usable from a hardware terminal, which, while maybe not particularly important in this day and age of effortless terminal emulators, is still quite a cool thing to have.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143365/haiku-vastly-improves-git-status-performance/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Another month, another summary of changes in Haiku, the BeOS-inspired operating system. The main focus this past month has been improving the performance of git status, which has been measurably worse on Haiku than on Linux running on similar hardware. This work has certainly paid off, as the numbers demonstrate. The results are clearly more than worth the trouble, though: in one test setup with&#160;git status&#160;in Haiku’s&#160;buildtools&#160;repository (which contains the entirety of the&#160;gcc&#160;and&#160;binutils&#160;source code, among other things – over 160,000 files) went from around 33 seconds with a cold disk cache, to around 20 seconds; and with a hot disk cache, from around 15 seconds to around 2.5 seconds. This is still a ways off from Linux (with a similar setup in the same repository,&#160;git status&#160;there with a hot disk cache takes only 0.3 seconds). Performance on Haiku will likely be measurably faster on builds without&#160;KDEBUG&#160;enabled, but not by that much. Still, this is clearly a significant improvement over the way things were before now. ↫ Haiku Activity &#38; Contract Report, August 2025 There&#8217;s more than this, of course, such as initial support for Intel&#8217;s Apollo Lake GPU in the Intel modesetting driver, improvements to USB disk performance, a reduction in power usage when in KDL, and much, much more.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Some time ago, people noticed that buried in the Windows Bluetooth drivers is the hard-coded name of the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000. What’s going on there? Does the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 receive favorable treatment from the Microsoft Bluetooth drivers? Is this some sort of collusion? No, it’s not that. ↫ Raymond Chen So, what is the actual problem? It&#8217;s a funny one: an encoding mistake. The device local name string for a device needs to be encoded in UTF-8, and that&#8217;s where the developers of the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 made a mistake. The string contains a registered trademark symbol &#8211; ® &#8211; but they encoded it in code page 1252, which not only isn&#8217;t allowed, but gets rejected completely. So, Windows&#8217; Bluetooth drivers have a table that contains the wrong name for a driver, accompanied by the right name to use. This mouse is the only entry.]]>
