        <![CDATA[Encrypting the data stored locally on your hard drives is generally a good idea, specifically if you have use a laptop and take it with you a lot and thieves might get a hold of it. This issue becomes even more pressing if you carry sensitive data as a dissident or whistleblower and have to deal with law enforcement. Or, you know, if you&#8217;re an American citizen fascist paramilitary groups like ICE doesn&#8217;t like because your skin colour is too brown or whatever. Windows offers local disk encryption too, in the form of its BitLocker feature, and Microsoft suggests users store their encryption keys on Microsoft&#8217;s servers. However, when you do so, these keys will be stored unencrypted, and it turns out Microsoft will happily hand them over to law enforcement. “This is private data on a private computer and they made the architectural choice to hold access to that data. They absolutely should be treating it like something that belongs to the user,” said Matt Green, cryptography expert and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute. “If Apple can do it, if Google can do it, then Microsoft can do it. Microsoft is the only company that&#8217;s not doing this,” he added. “It&#8217;s a little weird… The lesson here is that if you have access to keys, eventually law enforcement is going to come.” ↫ Thomas Brewster Microsoft is choosing to store these keys in unencrypted fashion, and that of course means law enforcement is going to come knocking. With everything that&#8217;s happening in the United States at the moment, the platitude of &#8220;I have nothing to hide&#8221; has lost even more of its meaning, as people &#8211; even toddlers &#8211; are being snatched from the streets and out of their homes on a daily basis by fascist paramilitaries. Even if times were better, though, Microsoft should still refrain from storing these keys unencrypted. It is entirely possible, nay, trivial to address this shortcoming, but the odds of the company fixing this while trying to suck up to the current US regime seem small. Everybody, but especially those living under totalitarian(-esque) regimes, should be taking extra care to make sure their data isn&#8217;t just encrypted, but that the keys are safe as well.]]>

      <title>Firefox on Linux in 2025</title>

        <![CDATA[Last year brought a wealth of new features and fixes to Firefox on Linux. Besides numerous improvements and bug fixes, I want to highlight some major achievements: HDR video playback support, reworked rendering for fractionally scaled displays, and asynchronous rendering implementation. All this progress was enabled by advances in the Wayland compositor ecosystem, with new features implemented by Mutter and KWin. ↫ Martin Stransky It&#8217;s amazing how the adoption of Wayland is making it so much easier for application developers to support modern features like these. Instead of having to settle for whatever roadblocks and limitations thrown up by legacy X11 cruft, the Linux desktop can now enjoy modern features like HDR, and much more easily support features like fractional scaling. The move to Wayland, as long as it may have taken, has catapulted the Linux desktop from its &#8217;90s roots right into the modern era. It&#8217;s great to see Firefox implementing improvements like these for Linux users, but of course, they come with Mozilla&#8217;s push to make Firefox an &#8220;AI&#8221; browser, something few Firefox users seem to want. Luckily, the various Firefox variants like Librewolf and Waterfox will get these same features while removing all the &#8220;AI&#8221; bloat, so as long as Mozilla remains committed to Firefox for Linux &#8211; or Firefox in general &#8211; Linux users can rest safe. Sadly, I&#8217;m afraid Mozilla&#8217;s massive pivot to &#8220;AI&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to work out, so I have no idea how long Mozilla will be able to afford Firefox on Linux development specifically, and Firefox development generally.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Developing for Windows seems to be a bit of a nightmare, at least according to Microsoft, so they&#8217;re trying to make the lives of developers easier with a new tool called winapp. The winapp CLI is specifically tailored for cross-platform frameworks and developers working outside of Visual Studio or MSBuild. Whether you are a web developer building with Electron, a C++ veteran using CMake, or a .NET, &#160;Rust or Dart developer building apps for Windows, the CLI can streamline the complexities of Windows development – from setting up your environment to packaging for distribution. This makes it significantly easier to access modern APIs – including Windows AI APIs, security features and shell integrations – directly from any toolchain. Windows development often involves managing multiple SDKs, creating and editing multiple manifests, generating certificates and navigating intricate packaging requirements. The goal of this project is to unify these tasks into a single CLI, letting you focus on building great apps rather than fighting with configuration. While the CLI is still in its early days, and there are many Windows development scenarios still in the works, we’re sharing this public preview now to learn from real usage, gather feedback and feature requests, and focus our investments on the areas that matter most to developers. ↫ Nikola Metulev at the Windows Blogs For instance, run the command winapp init at the root of your project, and winapp will download the proper SDKs, create manifest files, etc., all automatically. You can also generate the correct certificates, easily create MSIX packages, and more. The tool is available through winget and npm (for Electron projects), but is still in preview, with the code available on GitHub.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[ReactOS is celebrating its 30th birthday. Happy Birthday ReactOS! Today marks 30 years since the first commit to the ReactOS source tree. It’s been such a long journey that many of our contributors today, including myself, were not alive during this event. Yet our mission to deliver “your favorite Windows apps and drivers in an open-source environment you can trust” continues to bring people together. Let’s take a brief look at some of the high and low points throughout our history. ↫ Carl Bialorucki at the ReactOS website OSNews has been following ReactOS since about 2002 or so (the oldest reference I could find, but note that our 1997-2001 content isn&#8217;t available online, so we may have mentioned it earlier), so you can definitely say we all grew up alongside ReactOS&#8217; growth and development. All of the events the team mentions in their retrospective on 30 years of ReactOS were covered here on OSNews as well, which is wild to think about. Personally, I don&#8217;t really know how to feel about the project. On the one hand, I absolutely adore that dedicated, skilled, and talented individuals dedicate their precious free time to something as ambitious as creating a Windows NT-compatible operating system, and there&#8217;s no denying they&#8217;ve achieved incredible feats of engineering few people in the world are capable of. ReactOS is a hobby operating system that survived the test of time where few others have &#8211; AtheOS, Syllable, SkyOS , and so many others mentioned in that oldest reference I linked to are long dead and gone &#8211; and that alone makes it a massively successful project. On the other hand, its sheer ambition is also what holds the project down. If you say you&#8217;re going to offer a Windows NT-compatible operating system, you set expectations so insanely high you&#8217;ll never even come close to meeting them. Every time I&#8217;ve seen someone try ReactOS, either in writing or on YouTube, they always seem to come away disappointed &#8211; not because ReactOS isn&#8217;t impressive, but because it&#8217;s inevitably so far removed from its ambitious goals. And that&#8217;s a real shame. If you take away that ambitious goal of being Windows NT-compatible, and just focus on what they&#8217;ve already achieved as it stands now, there&#8217;s a really impressive and fun alternative operating system here. I really hope the next 30 years will be kind to ReactOS.]]>

        <![CDATA[If you have any interest in SGI&#8217;s IRIX or used IRIX back when it was still current, you&#8217;re undoubtedly aware of Nekoware, a collection of freeware for IRIX, maintained and kept up-to-date as much as possible. After stagnating in 2015 and a few failed restarts and some infighting (apparently), the project finally relaunched somewhere last year, and a new quarterly release was pushed out. Nekoware 2025Q4 is a clean break from previous releases, and requires that users fully remove any traces of previous installations. It contains the kinds of packages these freeware/open source collections for classic UNIX tended to contain: tons of common open source libraries, command-line tools, and more, including a few emulators. You&#8217;ll need IRIX 6.5.21 or newer, running on at least a MIPS R5000 processor-equipped SGI machine. Planning for and work on the next release is already underway, and a brand new Nekoware SDK has been released as well, which provides bootstrap functionality and addresses the problem of having to build Nekoware on unstable IRIX environments. Seeing Nekoware resurrected is great news for the surprisingly active IRIX community. As a HP-UX user, I feel some envy.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In January 1976, MOS Technologies presented a demonstration computer for their recently developed 6502 processor. MOS, which was acquired by Commodore later that year, needed to show the public what their low-cost processor was able to. The KIM-1 single board computer came fully assembled with an input keypad, a six-digit LED display, and complete documentation. It was intended for developers, but it turned out that at a price of only $249 the computer was the ideal playground for hobbyists, who could now afford a complete computer. The unforgettable Jim Butterfield described it like this back in 1999: But suddenly there was the KIM-1. It was fully assembled (although you had to add a power supply). Everybody’s KIM-1 was essentially the same (although the CPU added an extra instruction during the KIM-1’s production life). And this created something that was never before part of the home computer phenomenon: users could quite happily exchange programs with each other; magazines could publish such programs; and people could talk about a known system. We knew the 6502 chip was great, but it took quite a while to convince the majority of computer hobbyists. MOS Technology offered this CPU at a price that was a fraction of what the other available chips cost. We faced the attitude that “it must be no good because it’s too cheap,” even though the 6502, with its pipelined architecture, outperformed the 8080 and the 6800.&#8221; ↫ Jim Butterfield Even though there would soon be better equipped and faster home computers (mostly based on the 6502) and the KIM-1 vanished from the collective minds, the home computer revolution started  50 years ago in Jan 1976. Hans Otten keeps the memory alive on his homepage, where you can find a full collection of information about single-board computers and especially the KIM-1.]]>

      <title>Can you slim macOS down?</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144240/can-you-slim-macos-down/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Howard Oakley answers a very interesting question &#8211; is it possible to slim macOS down by turning off unneeded services and similar tricks? The answer is obviously no, you cannot. Classic Mac OS was more modular, with optional installs that the user could pick and choose, as shown above in Mac OS 9.1. These days with the SSV, choice is more limited from the start, with the only real options being whether to install the cryptexes used in AI, and the x86 code translator Rosetta 2. The latter is transient, though, and likely to go away next year. Like it or not, modern macOS isn’t designed or implemented to give the user much choice in which processes it runs, and architectural features including the SSV and DAS-CTS prevent you from paring its processes down to any significant degree. ↫ Howard Oakley That&#8217;s because macOS is not about creating the best experience for the user, but about creating the most value for shareholders. Giving users choice, allowing them to modify their operating system to suit their needs, removing unneeded components or replacing them with competing alternatives just isn&#8217;t in the interest of shareholders, and thus, it&#8217;s not allowed by Apple. That&#8217;s exactly why they&#8217;re fighting the EU&#8217;s very basic and simple consumer protection legislation tooth and nail with lies and propaganda, while giving Trump millions of dollars and silly plaques in bribes. You&#8217;re as much a user of macOS as a passenger on a ferry is its captain. If you just want to get from Harwich to Hoek van Holland, that&#8217;s a fine arrangement, but if you want to explore beyond the bounds of the path laid out by those more wealthy than you, you&#8217;re going to have to leave macOS behind and find a different ship.]]>

        <![CDATA[I totally forgot you could do this, but back in the Windows 9x days, you could hold down shift while clicking restart, and it would perform a sort-of &#8220;soft&#8221; restart without going through a complete reboot cycle. What&#8217;s going on here? The behavior you’re seeing is the result of passing the EW_RESTART­WINDOWS flag to the old 16-bit Exit­Windows function. What happens is that the 16-bit Windows kernel shuts down, and then the 32-bit virtual memory manager shuts down, and the CPU is put back into real mode, and control returns to win.com with a special signal that means “Can you start protected mode Windows again for me?” The code in win.com prints the “Please wait while Windows restarts…” message, and then tries to get the system back into the same state that it was in back when win.com had been freshly-launched. ↫ Raymond Chen There&#8217;s a whole lot more involved behind the curtains, of course, and if conditions aren&#8217;t right, the system will still perform a full reboot cycle. Chen further notes that because WIN.COM was written in assembly, getting back to that &#8220;freshly-launched&#8221; state wasn&#8217;t always easy to achieve. I only vaguely remember you could hold down shift and get a faster &#8220;reboot&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t remember ever really using it. I&#8217;ve been digging around in my memories since I saw this story yesterday, and I just can&#8217;t think of a scenario where I would&#8217;ve realised in time that I could do this.]]>

It turns out you&#8217;re not crazy, and at least for macOS, light mode has indeed been getting lighter. You can clearly see that the brightness of the UI has been steadily increasing for the last 16 years. The upper line is the default mode/light mode, the lower line is dark mode. When I started using MacOS in 2012, I was running Snow Leopard, the windows had an average brightness of 71%. Since then they’ve steadily increased so that in MacOS Tahoe, they’re at a full 100%. ↫ Will Richardson While this particular post only covers macOS, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to discover similar findings in Windows, GNOME, and KDE. The benefit of using KDE is that it&#8217;s at least relatively easy to switch colour schemes or themes, but changing colours in Windows is becoming a hidden feature, and GNOME doesn&#8217;t support it out of the box at all, and let&#8217;s not even get started about macOS. I think &#8220;light mode&#8221; should be &#8220;grey mode&#8221;, and definitely lament the lack of supported, maintained &#8220;grey modes&#8221; in both KDE and GNOME. There&#8217;s a reason that graphical user interfaces in the era of extensive science-based human-computer interaction research opted for soft, gentle greys (ooh, aah, mmm), and I&#8217;m convinced we need to bring it back. The glaring whites we use today are cold and clinical, and feel unpleasant to the point where I turn down the brightness of my monitor in a way that makes other colours feel too muted.

      <title>A lament for Aperture</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144219/a-lament-for-aperture/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[I&#8217;m not particularly interested in photo editing or management, professional or not, but one thing I do know is that many people who are miss one application in particular: Aperture. Discontinued over a decade ago, people still lament its loss, and Daniel Kennett explains to us layman why that&#8217;s the case. Aperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work. It’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work? And that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done. ↫ Daniel Kennett I half-expected to get some wishy-washy vibes-based article about some professional photo management tool, but instead, I came away easily and clearly understanding what made Aperture such a great tool. Beng able to access any set of tools wherever you are, without having to take a photo to a certain specific place in the user interface makes perfect sense to me, and the given counterexample from the modern Photos application instantly feels cumbersome and grating. At this point it&#8217;s clear Aperture&#8217;s never coming back, but I&#8217;m rather surprised nobody seems to have taken the effort to clone it. It seems there&#8217;s a market out there for something like this, but from what I gather Lightroom isn&#8217;t what Aperture fans are looking for, and any other alternatives are simply too limited or unpolished. There&#8217;s a market here, for sure. What other alternatives to Aperture exist today?]]>

      <source:markdown>I’m not particularly interested in photo editing or management, professional or not, but one thing I do know is that many people who are miss one application in particular: Aperture. Discontinued over a decade ago, people still lament its loss, and Daniel Kennett explains to us layman why that’s the case. Aperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.

        <![CDATA[Virtualisation is a lot older than you might think, with (one of?) the first implementation(s) being IBM&#8217;s VM/CMS, the line of operating systems that would grow to include things like System/370, System/390, all the way up until IBM/Z, which is still being developed and sold today; only recently IBM released the IBM z17 and z/OS 3.2, after all. The VM series of operating systems is designed exclusively for mainframes, and works by giving every user their own dedicated virtual machine running on top of the Control Program, the hypervisor. Inside this virtual machine the user can run a wide variety of operating systems, from the simple, single-user classics like IBM&#8217;s Conversational Monitor System, to more complex systems like Linux or AIX. Early versions of VM were released as open source and are now in the public domain, and enthusiasts have continued to build upon it and expand it, with the latest incarnations being the VM/370 Community Edition releases. They contain the Control Program and Conversational Monitor System, augmented by various fixes, improvements, and other additions. You can run VM in an emulator like Hercules, and continue on from there &#8211; but what, exactly, can you do with it? That&#8217;s where Fun things to do with your VM/370 machine comes in. This article will give you an introduction to the system, and a number of first and later steps you can take while exploring this probably alien environment. If you&#8217;ve always dreamt of using an early IBM mainframe, this is probably the easiest way to do so, because buying one is a really, really bad idea.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Since Wayland is still quite new to a lot of people, it&#8217;s often difficult to figure out which features the Wayland compositor you&#8217;re using actually supports. While the Wayland Explorer is a great way to browse through the various protocols and their status in various compositors, there&#8217;s now an easier way. The Wayland protocols table makes it very easy to see what your favourite compositor supports, which compositors support the protocol you really want supported before leaving X11 behind, and much more. Roughly speaking, there&#8217;s a set of stable core Wayland protocols, as well as a slew of unstable core Wayland protocols that are still in development, but may already be supported by various compositors. On top of that, compositors themselves also have a ton of protocols they themselves introduced and support, but which aren&#8217;t supported by anything else &#8211; yet, as they may be picked up by other compositors and eventually become part of Wayland&#8217;s core protocols. Keeping tabs on specific protocols and their support status is mostly only interesting for developers and people with very specific needs, since mature compositors provide a complete set of features most users never have to worry about. Still, that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t really cool features cooking, nor does it mean that one specific accessibility-related protocol isn&#8217;t incredibly important to keep track of. These websites provide an easy way to do so.]]>

      <title>Going immutable on macOS</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Speaking of NixOS&#8217; use of 9P, what if you want to, for whatever inexplicable reason, use macOS, but make it immutable? Immutable Linux distributions are getting a lot of attention lately, and similar concepts are used by Android and iOS, so it makes sense for people stuck on macOS to want similar functionality. Apple doesn&#8217;t offer anything to make this happen, but of course, there&#8217;s always Nix. And I literally do mean always. Only try out Nix if you&#8217;re willing to first be sucked into a pit of despair and madness before coming out enlightened on the other end &#8211; I managed to only narrowly avoid this very thing happening to me last year, so be advised. Nix is no laughing matter. Anyway, yes, you can use Nix to make macOS immutable. But managing a good working environment on macOS has long been a game of “hope for the best.” We’ve all been there: a curl &#124; sh here, a manual brew install there, and six months later, you’re staring at a broken PATH and a Python environment that seems to have developed its own consciousness. I’ve spent a lot of time recently moving my entire workflow into a declarative system using nix. From my zsh setup to my odin toolchain, here is why the transition from the imperative world of Homebrew to the immutable world of nix-darwin has been both a revelation and a fight. ↫ Carette Antonin Of course it&#8217;s been a fight &#8211; it&#8217;s Nix, after all &#8211; but it&#8217;s quite impressive and awesome that Nix can be used in this way. I would rather discover what electricity from light sockets tastes like than descend into this particular flavour of Nix madness, but if you&#8217;re really sick of macOS being a pile of trash for &#8211; among a lot of other things &#8211; homebrew and similar bolted-on systems held together by duct tape and spit, this might be a solution for you.]]>

      <title>Fun fact: there’s Plan 9 in Windows and QEMU</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144195/fun-fact-theres-plan-9-in-windows-and-qemu/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you&#8217;re only even remotely aware of the operating system Plan 9, you&#8217;ll most likely know that it takes the UNIX concept of &#8220;everything is a file&#8221; to the absolute extreme. In order to make sure all these files &#8211; and thus the components of Plan 9 &#8211; can properly communicate with one another, there&#8217;s 9P, or the Plan 9 Filesystem Protocol. Several Plan 9 applications are 9P file servers, for instance, and even things like windows are files. It&#8217;s a lot more complicated than this, of course, but that&#8217;s not relevant right now. Since Plan 9 wasn&#8217;t exactly a smashing success that took the operating system world by storm, you might not be aware that 9P is actually implemented in a few odd places. My favourite is how Microsoft turned to 9P for a crucial feature of its Windows Subsystem for Linux: accessing files inside a Linux VM running on Windows. To put it briefly: a 9P protocol file server facilitates file related requests, with Windows acting as the client. We’ve modified the WSL init daemon to initiate a 9P server. This server contains protocols that support Linux metadata, including permissions. A Windows service and driver that act as the client and talks to the 9P server (which is running inside of a WSL instance). Client and server communicate over AF_UNIX sockets, since WSL allows interop between a Windows application and a Linux application using AF_UNIX as described in this post. ↫ Craig Loewen at Microsoft&#8217;s Dev Blogs This implementation is still around today, so if you&#8217;re using Windows Subsystem for Linux, you&#8217;re using a little bit of Plan 9 as glue to make it all come together. Similarly, if you&#8217;re using QEMU and sharing files between the host and a VM through the VirtFS driver, you&#8217;re also using 9P. Both NixOS and GNU Guix use 9P when they build themselves inside a virtual machine, too, and there&#8217;s probably a few other places where you can run into 9P. I don&#8217;t know, I thought this was interesting.]]>

        <![CDATA[Are you a normal person and thus sick of all the nonsensical, non-browser stuff browser makers keep adding to your browser, but for whatever reason you don&#8217;t want to or cannot switch to one of the forks of your browser of choice? Just the Browser helps you remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from desktop web browsers. The goal is to give you &#8220;just the browser&#8221; and nothing else, using hidden settings in web browsers intended for companies and other organizations. This project includes configuration files for popular web browsers, documentation for installing and modifying them, and easy installation scripts. Everything is open-source on GitHub. ↫ Just The Browser&#8217;s website It comes in the form of scripts for Windows, Linux, or macOS, and can be used for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. It&#8217;s all open source so you can check the scripts for yourself, but there are also manual guides for each browser if you&#8217;re not too keen on running an unknown script. The changes won&#8217;t be erased by updates, unless the specific settings and configuration flags used are actually removed or altered by the browser makers.

      <source:markdown>Are you a normal person and thus sick of all the nonsensical, non-browser stuff browser makers keep adding to your browser, but for whatever reason you don’t want to or cannot switch to one of the forks of your browser of choice? Just the Browser helps you remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from desktop web browsers. The goal is to give you “just the browser” and nothing else, using hidden settings in web browsers intended for companies and other organizations. This project includes configuration files for popular web browsers, documentation for installing and modifying them, and easy installation scripts. Everything is open-source on GitHub. ↫ Just The Browser’s website It comes in the form of scripts for Windows, Linux, or macOS, and can be used for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. It’s all open source so you can check the scripts for yourself, but there are also manual guides for each browser if you’re not too keen on running an unknown script. The changes won’t be erased by updates, unless the specific settings and configuration flags used are actually removed or altered by the browser makers. That’s all there’s to it – a very straightforward tool.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[Despite December being the holiday month, Haiku&#8217;s developers got a lot of things done. A welcome addition for those of us who regularly install Haiku on EFI systems is a tool in the installer that will copy the EFI loader to the EFI system partition, so fewer manual steps are needed on EFI systems. Support for touchpads from Elantech has also been improved, and the FreeBSD driver compatibility layer and all of its Ethernet and WiFi drivers have been updated to match the recent FreeBSD 15 release. Of course, there&#8217;s also the usual long list of smaller fixes, improvements, and changes. As for a new release milestone, beta 6 seems to be on the way. Not quite. There has been some discussion on the mailing list as the ticket list gets smaller, but there’s still at least some more regressions that need to be fixed.

Just grab the latest nightly, follow the installation instructions, and you&#8217;re good to go.

      <title>Can you turn Windows 95’s Windows 3.10-based pre-install environment into a full desktop without using Microsoft products?</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144180/can-you-turn-windows-95s-windows-3-10-based-pre-install-environment-into-a-full-desktop-without-using-microsoft-products/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s no secret that the Windows 95 installer uses a heavily stripped-down Windows 3.10 runtime, but what can you actually do with it? How far can you take this runtime? Can it run Photoshop? It is a long-standing tradition for Microsoft to use a runtime copy of Windows as a part of Windows Setup. But the copy is so stripped-down, it cannot run anything but the setup program (winsetup.bin). OR IS IT? A mini-challenge for myself: create a semi-working desktop only based on runtime Windows 3.10 shipped with Windows 95 installer but not using any other Microsoft products. ↫ Nina Kalinina A crucial limitation here is that Kalinina is not allowing herself to use any additional Microsoft products, so the easy route of just copying missing DLLs and other files from a Windows 95 disk or whatever is not available to her; she has to source any needed files from other sources. This may seem impossible, but during those days, tons of Windows (and even DOS) applications would ship with various Microsoft DLLs included, so there are definitely places to get Windows DLLs that aren&#8217;t coming directly from Microsoft. As an example, since there&#8217;s no shell of any kind included in the stripped-down Windows 3.10 runtime, Kalinina tried Calmira and WinBar, which won&#8217;t work without a few DLLs. Where to get them if you can&#8217;t get them straight from Microsoft? Well, it turns out programs compiled with later version of MSVC would include several of these needed DLLs, and AutoCad R12 was one of them. WinBar would now start and work, and while Calmira would install, it didn&#8217;t work because it needs the Windows Multimedia Subsystem, which don&#8217;t seem to be included in anything non-Microsoft. It turns out you can take this approach remarkably far. Things like Calculator and Notepad will work, but Pain or Paintbrush will not. Larger, more complex applications work too &#8211; Photoshop 2.5.1 works, as does Netscape, but without any networking stack, it&#8217;s a little bit moot. Even Calmira XP eventually runs, as some needed DLLs are found inside &#8220;Mom For Windows 2.0&#8221;, at which point the installation starts to look and feel a lot like a regular Windows 3.x installation, minus things like settings panels and a bunch of default applications. Is this useful? Probably not, but who cares &#8211; it&#8217;s an awesome trick, and that alone makes it a worthwhile effort.]]>

      <source:markdown>In the mid-1980s, scientists [published a startling finding](https://www.nature.com/articles/315207a0)–a giant hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. That’s the protective shield that blocks large amounts of harmful UV radiation. And without it, the rate of cancer, cataracts and crop failure would skyrocket. Today on the show, we dive into ozone science and examine how scientists successfully sounded the alarm and solved an Antarctic mystery.

Microsoft is testing a new feature that integrates Copilot into the File Explorer, but it’s not going to be another ‘Ask Copilot’ button in the right-click menu.

Who wants this? Why utterly destroy what little reputation and goodwill Windows has left? Has the hype bubble become this clouded and intoxicating? Even system administrators who want to turn off Copilot in their organisations or device fleets in an official, supported way are getting punched in the face by Microsoft. The company rolled out a new Group Policy to disable Copilot, but it&#8217;s such a useless mess it might as well not be there at all. This essentially means that IT admins will only be able to uninstall the Copilot app for customers where their device has both Copilot apps installed by either a clean install or by the IT team itself, as long as the Copilot app has not been opened in a month. So, even if you accidentally open the Copilot app for a second because it&#8217;s there in your Windows taskbar, the Copilot app won&#8217;t be uninstalled. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin You shouldn&#8217;t be using Windows.]]>

The Phosh developers focus from day one was to make devices running Phosh daily drivable without having to resort to any proprietary OSes as a fallback. This year showed improvements in some important areas people rely on like cell broadcasts and emergency calls, further improving usability and starting some ground work we’ll need for some upcoming features. ↫ Phosh developers In 2025, Posh gained support for cell broadcasts &#8211; like the emergency messages regarding storms, or alerts about missing persons, that sort of stuff &#8211; which is a pretty important feature in this day and age. Posh also improved its support for per-source audio volumes and one source of audio muting another, its on-screen keyboard, its compositor, and much more. Of course, the main problem for shells like Phosh is hardware support, which is handled by the underlying operating system, like PostmarketOS. These Linux mobile operating systems are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to hardware support, and while Android application support can fill some of the application shortcomings, you&#8217;re going to be making pretty significant concessions by switching to mobile Linux at the moment. When even Android ROMs not sanctioned by Google are having issues with banking applications or government ID stuff, using mobile Linux will be even more of a problem. None of this is the fault of any of the people dedicating their free time to things like Phosh or PostmarketOS, of course &#8211; it&#8217;s just a sad reality of a market we once again just gave up to a few megacorporations, with our governments too cowardly to stand up and fix this issue.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Budgie has fallen a bit by the wayside in recent years, but it&#8217;s still in development and making steady progress. The project&#8217;s just released Budgie 10.10, the final release in the 10.x series which also marks the end of the transition to Wayland. Budgie 10.10 is a brand new release series for Budgie Desktop, marking our first release to migrate Budgie from X11 to Wayland. This release series brings to a close just over a decade of Budgie 10 development; we are formally putting Budgie 10 into maintenance mode to focus our efforts on Budgie 11. ↫ Joshua Strobl Budgie is taking a very interesting approach for its move to Wayland; instead of writing every single component of their desktop environment from scratch or porting their X11 tools, the project opted to reuse and implement a ton of established, well-tested, and popular Wayland tools like swaybg, swayidle, labwc, and so on. This obviously saves on development time, but also ensures the transition to Wayland is relatively smooth. Things like the panel, applets, the Budgie Control Center, and so on, have been updated or rewritten. There&#8217;s also some new features, as well as a ton of bug fixes and smaller improvements. As noted, this release marks the end of the road for the 10.x series, with development now shifting to Budgie 11. Upcoming releases of major distributions will have Budgie 10.10 in their repositories.]]>

This release series brings to a close just over a decade of Budgie 10 development; we are formally putting Budgie 10 into maintenance mode to focus our efforts on Budgie 11. ↫ Joshua Strobl Budgie is taking a very interesting approach for its move to Wayland; instead of writing every single component of their desktop environment from scratch or porting their X11 tools, the project opted to reuse and implement a ton of established, well-tested, and popular Wayland tools like swaybg, swayidle, labwc, and so on. This obviously saves on development time, but also ensures the transition to Wayland is relatively smooth. Things like the panel, applets, the Budgie Control Center, and so on, have been updated or rewritten. There’s also some new features, as well as a ton of bug fixes and smaller improvements. As noted, this release marks the end of the road for the 10.x series, with development now shifting to Budgie 11. Upcoming releases of major distributions will have Budgie 10.10 in their repositories.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[Since we entered a new year, we also entered a new quarter, and that means a new quarterly report from the Hurd, the project that aims to, to this day, developer a kernel for the GNU operating system. Over the course of the fourth quarter of 2025, an important undertaking has been to port dhcpcd to Hurd, which will ultimately bring IPv6 support to Hurd. For now, the port only supports IPv4, only works on Ethernet, and is still generally quite limited when it comes to its functionality. It&#8217;s a great start, though, and an amazing effort. Furthermore, Q4 2025 also saw improvements in symmetric multiprocessing support on x86, not exactly a small feat. There&#8217;s a ton of work left to be done, but progress is being made and that&#8217;s important considering today&#8217;s processor landscape. There&#8217;s also the usual load of fixes, smaller improvements, and changes all over the operating system, and the report makes it clear that Debian&#8217;s recent announcement that APT will start requiring Rust is not a major issue for Hurd, as it already has a Rust port.]]>

      <title>Firefox on POWER9: the JIT of it</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144144/firefox-on-power9-the-jit-of-it/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Four years ago, I reviewed a truly fully open source desktop computer, from operating system down to firmware: the Raptor Blackbird, built entirely around IBM&#8217;s POWER9 processor. The overall conclusion was that using was mostly an entirely boring experience, which was a very good thing &#8211; usually ideologically-fueled computers come with a ton of downsides and limitations for average users, but Raptor&#8217;s POWER9 machines bucked this trend by presenting a bog-standard, run-of-the-mill desktop Linux experience, almost indistinguishable from using an x86 machine. Almost indistinguishable. The one thing that was missing from using desktop Linux on POWER9 was Firefox&#8217; JIT, which meant that many websites, especially more complex ones, would bring the browsing experience down to a crawl. One area where this affected me quite a bit was our own WordPress backend, which is effectively unusable on Firefox without its JIT. The only other option was to use Chromium, which was fully ported to POWER9 &#8211; but I don&#8217;t like Chromium, and want to use Firefox to be able to share tabs, history, passwords, and so on. Since then, back in 2021, things have improved. The ongoing effort to port Firefox&#8217; JIT to POWER9, led by Cameron Kaiser, made a ton of progress, to the point where community Firefox builds with Kaiser&#8217;s JIT integrated became available through a dedicated Fedora copr. Sadly, the last build is from four months ago, and covers Firefox 128.14.0-1, an old ESR release. Since I recently set up the other machine Raptor sent to me &#8211; a Talos II workstation with two POWER9 processors &#8211; I was curious what the state of the POWER9 JIT effort was, so I inquired on the related bug report for Firefox. Kaiser replied, and explained that due to a critical error with wasm against later versions of the JIT, as well as a change in his personal circumstances forcing him to work on this effort remotely &#8211; obviously not great for a client application like Firefox &#8211; there simply hasn&#8217;t been much progress, until last week (what a coincidence!). Last week I took some time off work and dragged the JIT up to the current ESR. This compiles and links. However, although it passes the majority of the test suite, there are still too many serious failures to make it useable. I&#8217;m continuing work on this in whatever free time I actually have on my workstation. If I can restore test compliance in Baseline mode, this would suffice for a community third-party build like what Dan Horak generates now, since that is what is in 128. To get it in tree, however, I would also need to solve that critical wasm fault which manifested in the interim and fix the remaining gaps in the CodeGenerator to get it to a point of sufficient quality. ↫ Cameron Kaiser There are two main problems at the moment that make it harder than it needs to be to work on this effort. First, the state of debugging tools on ppc64le &#8211; to which POWER9 belongs &#8211; is apparently not great, requiring Kaiser to step through thousands of instructions manually using gdb just to fix the last bug he discovered. That&#8217;s clearly deeply suboptimal, not fun, and not something somebody should spend their precious free time on. At this point in the discussion, Raptor&#8217;s Timothy Pearson jumped in and noted that getting rr-debugger to work on POWER9 is something Raptor would be interested in, but it wouldn&#8217;t be cheap: On the topic of the debugger (rr-debugger), while this isn&#8217;t on our internal roadmap at the moment it is something that Raptor could do under a development contract. The main question is whether there is enough interest to make that viable; the work is significant so the cost would probably be in the mid to upper 5 figures range (USD), assuming no major roadblocks are discovered. When I was looking into it before I was fairly certain the PMU on POWER9 supports the overall structure of rr-debugger&#8217;s methods, and that our load-store idioms are generally compatible. The former is what stops it working on most arm64 devices IIRC, and the latter is relevant mainly to non-POWER RISC architectures. ↫ Timothy Pearson Kaiser noted that while having rr-debugger available wouldn&#8217;t be a magic bullet, it would make the whole process a lot easier. The second major issue is, of course, the same one as it always is for such niche efforts: a lack of manpower. According to Kaiser, there&#8217;s enough interest and awareness in getting Firefox&#8217; JIT ported to POWER9, with the real problem being that there simply aren&#8217;t a lot of people with enough knowledge of both Firefox&#8217; JIT and the modern ppc64le ISA. Understandably, Kaiser would like to avoid having to deal with people who are well-intentioned but don&#8217;t fully grasp the complexity of the undertaking at hand. This is not exactly an easy effort, and it&#8217;s honestly downright amazing how far along the project already is. Even if it&#8217;s an older version, being able to run Firefox 128ESR on POWER9 with a working JIT makes such a huge difference to the overall desktop user experience, and I&#8217;m sure I speak for the entire POWER9 community when I say I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for it. Still, it would be amazing if we could find someone with just the right skillset to help Kaiser out, to be able to get the JIT stable enough again for community Firefox builds &#8211; and perhaps even look at what lies beyond: getting it upstreamed into Firefox as a whole. The odds of finding that person are slim &#8211; if you&#8217;re into this sort of stuff, you&#8217;re most likely already aware of the POWER9 JIT effort &#8211; but who knows, maybe shining some renewed light on this task will make a difference. If you happen to have the right skillset and appreciate the complexities involved in this effort, you might want to reach out.]]>

        <![CDATA[About half a year ago, I wrote an article about persistent rumours I&#8217;d heard from Android ROM projects that Google was intending to discontinue the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). AOSP has been gutted by Google over the years, with the company moving more and more parts of the operating system into closed-source, non-AOSP components, like Google Play Services. While you can technically still run bare AOSP if you&#8217;re really hardcore, it&#8217;s simply unusable for 99% of smartphone users out there. Google quickly responded to these widespread rumours, stating that &#8220;AOSP is not going away&#8221;, and a lot of people, clearly having learned nothing from human history, took this at face value and believed Google word-for-word. Since corporations can&#8217;t be trusted and lying is their favourite activity, I drew a different conclusion at the time: This seems like a solid denial from Google, but it leaves a lot of room for Google to make a wide variety of changes to Android’s development and open source status without actually killing off AOSP entirely. Since Android is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, Google is free to make “Pixel Android” – its own Android variant – closed source, leaving AOSP up until that point available under the Apache 2.0 license. This is reminiscent of what Oracle did with Solaris. Of course, any modifications to the Linux kernel upon which Android is built will remain open source, since the Linux kernel is licensed under the GPLv2. If Google were indeed intending to do this, what could happen is that Google takes Android closed source from here on out, spinning off whatever remains of AOSP up until that point into a separate company or project, as potentially ordered during the antitrust case against Google in the United States. This would leave Google free to continue developing its own “Pixel Android” entirely as proprietary software – save for the Linux kernel – while leaving AOSP in the state it’s in right now outside of Google. This technically means “AOSP is not going away”, as Chau claims. ↫ Thom Holwerda at OSNews Ever since the claim that &#8220;AOSP is not going away&#8221;, Google has taken numerous steps to further tighten the grip it has on Android, much to the detriment of both the Android Open Source Project and the various ROM makers that depend on it. Device-specific source code for Pixel devices is no longer being released, Google dabbled with developer certification even for developers outside of Google Play, and Google significantly scaled back the release of security patches to AOSP. And now it&#8217;s early 2026, and Google is about to take the next step in the slow killing of the Android Open Source Project. On the main page of the Android Open Source Project, there&#8217;s now a new message: Effective in 2026, to align with our trunk stable development model and ensure platform stability for the ecosystem, we will publish source code to AOSP in Q2 and Q4. For building and contributing to AOSP, we recommend utilizing android-latest-release instead of aosp-main. The android-latest-release manifest branch will always reference the most recent release pushed to AOSP. This means that instead of four AOSP code releases every year, Google is now scaling back to just two every year. The gutting and eventual killing of AOSP has now reached the point where the open source nature of AOSP is effectively meaningless, and we&#8217;re yet a few more big steps closer to what I outlined above: eventually, Google will distance itself from AOSP entirely, focusing all of its efforts on Pixel Android alone &#8211; without any code contributions to AOSP at all. If you still think &#8220;AOSP is not going away&#8221;, you&#8217;re delusional. OASP is already on life support, and with this latest move Google is firmly gripping the plug.]]>

ARM64 now has dynamic linking support, POSIX compliance has been improved, and countless other improvements. Of course, there&#8217;s also the usual massive list of bug fixes and minor changes to the kernel, relibc, drivers, and so on. I genuinely wish the Redox project another successful year. The team seems to have its head screwed on right, and is making considerable progress basically every month.

        <![CDATA[Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, … As always here we’re going to revisit all the exciting news from our favourite Linux distribution. ↫ Gentoo&#8217;s 2025 retrospective We don&#8217;t talk about Gentoo very often, and I consider that a good thing. Gentoo is just Gentoo, doing its thing, seemingly unaffected by the shifting sands of any community or world events. Gentoo will always just be Gentoo, and we&#8217;re all better for it. The past year brought a ton of improvements to both Gentoo as a distribution and as a wider project and community. Because of Github&#8217;s insistence to shove &#8220;AI&#8221; into everything, the project is currently moving to Codeberg instead, EAPI 9 has been approved and finalised, there are now weekly Gentoo images for WSL, the project welcomed several new developers, they&#8217;ve got a second build server, and so much more. Sadly, the project did have to drop the hppa and sparc architectures down a peg due to a lack of hardware, which hurts my soul a tiny bit but is entirely understandable, of course. Gentoo is doing great, and I doubt it&#8217;ll ever not be doing great. Gentoo is just Gentoo.]]>

And this is the Linux version of Steam, not the Windows one (but the Windows one works too if you really prefer that one). While Box32 (used to run Steam) is still experimental and unstable, stability did improve. Still, expect some crashes when downloading things with steam. And it’s not all, Battle.net is also getting stable, and some games are working too. Not all unfortunately, and your success might depend on your geographical region, as program versions might differ. At least, you can try it on ARM64 &#38; Loongarch.

Windows creates these files while installing apps, loading web pages, or running updates. Left unchecked, they pile up and hog valuable space. Luckily, clearing them out is easier than cleaning your kitchen junk drawer. Let’s explore Storage Sense, Disk Cleanup, manual deletion, and a few bonus performance tips to keep your PC running like new. ↫ Microsoft Windows Learning Center You may think this is one of those junk SEO articles generated by &#8220;AI&#8221; to trap Google searches, but no, this is published by Microsoft on Microsoft&#8217;s website. Instead of fixing the long-standing and well-known problems around Windows being absolutely terrible at keeping itself clean and functional over longer periods of time, the company figured it&#8217;d be a better idea to just keep shoving that responsibility unto users instead. None of the tools mentioned in this article should need to be run or set up by users manually. A computer is supposed to make life less tedious, not more so, and I already have enough cleaning up and laundry to do out here in the real world, and I don&#8217;t want to be bothered with it on my computer. Why on earth am I supposed to manually remove unnecessary Windows Update files? Why did Adobe installers leave about 15GB of old installers in some directory inside C:/Windows on my wife&#8217;s computer that I had to remove using a third party tool? In what universe is this okay? Sometimes I wonder how much of our collective time is wasted just by dealing with Windows on a day-to-day basis in our society.

Few OEMs were asking for an 8086 version of CP/M. One that did was SCP &#8211; the same company that helped Microsoft design SoftCard. They needed a disk operating system for their 8086 board released in November 1979. In April 1980, after CP/M-86 was still nowhere to be seen, they lost patience and asked their young engineer Tim Paterson to develop a “quick and dirty” OS similar to CP/M that would hopefully boost the sales of their board. That little operating system, officially named 86-DOS, was eventually purchased by Microsoft and renamed MS-DOS. Paterson has stated on multiple occasions that he would never have begun developing it had CP/M‑86 been available on time. ↫ Nemanja Trifunovic There&#8217;s a ton more in this article about CP/M-86 and its gestation period, but this tangled little knot of coincidences always entertains me. It really could&#8217;ve been CP/M, and it really could&#8217;ve not been Microsoft. This industry is filled to the brim with interesting what-if stories that we barely regard as a worthy footnote, but few are as fascinating as what the world would&#8217;ve looked like had CP/M won out over DOS. The entire world would&#8217;ve been drastically different, and while nobody can say with a straight face it would be a better world, we&#8217;d at least not have the spectres of MS-DOS haunting system administrators, developers, and users the world over. Of course, they&#8217;d be haunted by different spectres, but still.]]>

But even if there were, the premise itself is questionable: if everything has an icon, it doesn’t mean users will find what they are looking for faster. And even if the premise was solid, I still wish I could say: they did the best they could, given the goal.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[CheriBSD is a Capability Enabled, Unix-like Operating System that extends FreeBSD to take advantage of Capability Hardware on Arm’s Morello and CHERI-RISC-V platforms. CheriBSD implements memory protection and software compartmentalization features, and is developed by SRI International and the University of Cambridge. ↫ CheriBSD website This obviously raises the question &#8211; what exactly is CHERI? The FreeBSD Foundation has an article about this from 2023 providing more details. CHERI extends existing architectures (Armv8-A, MIPS64 (retired), RISC-V, and x86_64 (in development)) with a new hardware type, the CHERI capability. In CHERI systems, all access to memory is via CHERI capabilities either explicitly via new instructions or implicitly via a Default Data Capability (DDC) and Program Counter Capability (PCC) used by instructions with integer arguments. Capabilities grant access to specific ranges of (virtual, or occasionally, physical) memory via a base and length, and can further restrict access with permissions, which are compressed into a 128-bit representation (64-bits for the address and 64-bits for the metadata). In memory and in registers, capabilities are protected by tags that are cleared when the capability data is modified by a non-capability instruction or if a capability instruction would increase the access the capability grants. Tags are stored separately from data and cannot be manipulated directly. ↫ Brooks Davis CheriBSD brings this capability to anyone with compatible hardware, providing access to about 10000 pre-built memory-safe packages alongside more than 260000 pre-built memory-unsafe packages, as well as fully memory-safe versions of the KDE desktop, bhyve, and a ton of others. You can use both types of packages alongside one another, there&#8217;s a nice installer, and it basically seems like you&#8217;re using regular FreeBSD, just with additional complications, the biggest of which is, of course, the limited hardware support. I have a feeling that if you&#8217;re the kind of person to own CHERI-enabled hardware, you&#8217;re most likely already aware of CheriBSD. Still, if this is something you&#8217;re looking for, be aware that you&#8217;re going ot need special hardware. It&#8217;s also important to note that DTrace won&#8217;t work on CheriBSD, and most optional modules, like firewall systems, don&#8217;t work either.]]>

For a while, even, this was, as far as I can tell, one of the easiest ways to fix activation issues caused by replacing one component too many, causing Windows activation to think you had a new machine. Phone activation was always remarkably more lenient and forgiving than online activation. Well, as part of Microsoft&#8217;s crusade to make Windows progressively more shit, it seems phone activation is going away. However, that seems to no longer work on Windows 11 or 10 or Windows 7 either, as another user Ben Kleinberg has documented on his YouTube channel.

        <![CDATA[It shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that the HP-UX FAQ eventually grew an entry for &#8220;how can I make a 712 run headless&#8221;. It was possible, and to do it you had to change the firmware &#8220;console&#8221; path. The 712 firmware would not allow you to do this, to keep you locked to a keyboard and frame buffer console, but some of the HP-UX standalone tools could be used to change this without the firmware getting in the way, so the FAQ recipe was roughly &#8220;abort the boot sequence, at the BOOT_ADMIN&#62; prompt, do not start the HP-UX kernel but some diagnostic tool, and then at the tools prompt, type a magic sequence without any mistake or you&#8217;ll be very, very, very sorry&#8221;. There was no exaggeration in these words: the magic sequence is conspath 2/0/4.0x283, which is everything but intuitive and easy to remember. ↫ Miod Vallat What a great story.]]>

      <source:markdown>It shouldn’t be surprising that the HP-UX FAQ eventually grew an entry for “how can I make a 712 run headless”. It was possible, and to do it you had to change the firmware “console” path. The 712 firmware would not allow you to do this, to keep you locked to a keyboard and frame buffer console, but some of the HP-UX standalone tools could be used to change this without the firmware getting in the way, so the FAQ recipe was roughly “abort the boot sequence, at the BOOT\_ADMIN&#62; prompt, do not start the HP-UX kernel but some diagnostic tool, and then at the tools prompt, type a magic sequence without any mistake or you’ll be very, very, very sorry”.
