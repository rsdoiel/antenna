        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s 31 December 2025 today, the last day of the year, but it also happens to mark the end of support for the last and final version of one of my favourite operating systems: HP-UX. Today is the day HPE puts the final nail in the coffin of their long-running UNIX operating system, marking the end of another vestige of the heyday of the commercial UNIX variants, a reign ended by cheap x86 hardware and the increasing popularisation of Linux. HP-UX&#8217; versioning is a bit of a convoluted mess for those not in the know, but the versions that matter are all part of the HP-UX 11i family. HP-UX 11i v1 and v2 (also known as 11.11 and 11.23, respectively) have been out of support for exactly a decade now, while HP-UX 11i v3 (also known as 11.31) is the version whose support ends today. To further complicate matters, like 11i v2, HP-UX 11i v3 supports two hardware platforms: HP 9000 (PA-RISC) and HP Integrity (Intel Itanium). Support for the HP-UX 11i v3 variant for HP 9000 ended exactly four years ago, and today marks the end of support for HP-UX 11i v3 for HP Integrity. And that&#8217;s all she wrote. I have two HP-UX 11i v1 PA-RISC workstations, one of them being my pride and joy: an HP c8000, the last and fastest PA-RISC workstation HP ever made, back in 2005. It&#8217;s a behemoth of a machine with two dual-core PA-8900 processors running at 1Ghz, 8 GB of RAM, a FireGL X3 graphics card, and a few other fun upgrades like an internal LTO3 tape drive that I use for keeping a bootable recovery backup of the entire system. It runs HP-UX 11i v1, fully updated and patched as best one can do considering how many patches have either vanished from the web or have never &#8220;leaked&#8221; from HPE (most patches from 2009 onwards are not available anywhere without an expensive enterprise support contract). The various versions of HP-UX 11i come with a variety &#8220;operating environments&#8221; you can choose from, depending on the role your installation is supposed to fulfill. In the case of my c8000, it&#8217;s running the Technical Computing Operating Environment, which is the OE intended for workstations. HP-UX 11i v1 was the last PA-RISC version of the operating system to officially support workstations, with 11i v2 only supporting Itanium workstations. There are some rumblings online that 11i v2 will still work just fine on PA-RISC workstations, but I have not yet tried this out. My c8000 also has a ton of other random software on it, of course, and only yesterday I discovered that the most recent release of sudo configures, compiles, and installs from source just fine on it. Sadly, a ton of other modern open source code does not run on it, considering the slightly outdated toolchain on HP-UX and few people willing and/or able to add special workarounds for such an obscure platform. Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve been trying to get into contact with HPE about the state of HP-UX&#8217; patches, software, and drivers, which are slowly but surely disappearing from the web. A decent chunk is archived on various websites, but a lot of it isn&#8217;t, which is a real shame. Most patches from 2009 onwards are unavailable, various software packages and programs for HP-UX are lost to time, HP-UX installation discs and ISOs later than 2006-2009 are not available anywhere, and everything that is available is only available via non-sanctioned means, if you know what I mean. Sadly, I never managed to get into contact with anyone at HPE, and my concerns about HP-UX preservation seem to have fallen on deaf ears. With the end-of-life date now here, I&#8217;m deeply concerned even more will go missing, and the odds of making the already missing stuff available are only decreasing. I&#8217;ve come to accept that very few people seem to hold any love for or special attachment to HP-UX, and that very few people care as much about its preservation as I do. HP-UX doesn&#8217;t carry the movie star status of IRIX, nor the benefits of being available as both open source and on commodity hardware as Solaris, so far fewer people have any experience with it or have developed a fondness for it. HP-UX didn&#8217;t star in a Steven Spielberg blockbuster, it didn&#8217;t leave behind influential technologies like ZFS. Despite being supported up until today, it&#8217;s mostly forgotten &#8211; and not even HPE itself seems to care. And that makes me sad. When you raise your glasses tonight to mark the end of 2025 and welcome the new year, spare a thought for the UNIX everyone forgot still exists. I know I will.]]>

I&#8217;m sure quite a few of use mused about this very concept at some point in time, but hikari_no_yume went a step further and created this working concept. It&#8217;s rough around the edges and needs a ton of work, but I do think the idea is sound and could offer real benefits for certain types of users. It&#8217;s definitely a more realistic idea than ReactOS, a project that&#8217;s perpetually chasing the dragon but never coming even close to catching it. Not having to recreate the entire Windows NT kernel, drivers, and subsystems, and using Linux instead, is simply a more realistic approach that could bring results within our lifetimes. The added benefit here is that this could still run Linux applications, too, of course. hikari_no_yume is looking for help with the project, and I hope they find it. This is a great idea, with an absolutely amazing name, too.]]>

        <![CDATA[Nina Kalinina has been on an absolute roll lately, diving deep into VisiOn, uncovering Bellcore MGR, installing Linux on a PC-98 machine, and much more. This time, she&#8217;s ported Windows 2 to run on a machine it was never supposed to run on. I bought my first Apricot PC about three years ago, when I realised I wanted an 8086-based computer. At the time, I knew nothing about it and simply bought it because it looked rad and the price was low. I had no idea that it was not IBM PC-compatible, and that there were very few programs available for it. I have been on a quest to get a modern-ish word processor and spreadsheet program for it ever since. Which eventually made me &#8220;port&#8221; Windows 2 on it. In this post, I will tell you the story of this port. ↫ Nina Kalinina To get Windows 2 working on the Apricot, Kalinina had to create basic video, keyboard, and mouse drivers, allowing Windows 2 to boot into text mode. I wasn&#8217;t aware of this, but Windows 2 in text mode is funky: it&#8217;s rendering all the text you would see in a full Windows 2 user interface, just without any of the user interface elements. Further developing the video driver from scratch turned out to be too big of an undertaking for now, so she opted to extract the video driver from Windows 1 instead &#8211; which required a whole other unique approach. The keyboard and mouse drivers were extracted from Windows 1 in the same way. The end result is a fully working copy of Windows 2, including things like Word and Excel, which was the original goal in the first place. There aren&#8217;t many people around doing stuff like this, and it&#8217;s great to see such very peculiar, unique itches being scratched. Even if this is only relevant for exactly one person, it&#8217;s still been worth it.]]>

        <![CDATA[There&#8217;s been endless talk online about just how bad Apple&#8217;s graphical user interface design has become over the years, culminating in the introduction of Liquid Glass across all of the company&#8217;s operating systems this year. Despite all the gnawing of teeth and scathing think pieces before the final rollout, it seems the average Apple user simply doesn&#8217;t care as much about GUI design as Apple bloggers thought they did, as there hasn&#8217;t been any uproar or stories in local media about how you should hold off on updating your iPhone. The examples of just how bad Apple&#8217;s GUI design has become keep on coming, though. This time it&#8217;s Howard Oakley showing once again how baffling the macOS UI is these days. If someone had told me 12 months ago what was going to happen this past year, I wouldn’t have believed them. Skipping swiftly past all the political, economic and social turmoil, I come to the interface changes brought in macOS Tahoe with Liquid Glass. After three months of strong feedback during beta-testing, I was disappointed when Tahoe was released on 15 September to see how little had been addressed. When 26.1 followed on 3 November it had only regressed, and 26.2 has done nothing. Here I summarise my opinions on where Tahoe’s overhaul has gone wrong. ↫ Howard Oakley at The Eclectic Light Company Apple bloggers and podcasters are hell-bent on blaming Apple&#8217;s terrible GUI design over the past 10 years on one man. Their first target was Jony Ive, who was handed control over not just hardware design, but also software design in 2012. When he left Apple, GUI design at Apple would finally surely improve again, and the Apple bloggers and podcasters let out a sigh of relief. History would turn out different, though &#8211; under Ive&#8217;s successor, Alan Dye, Apple&#8217;s downward trajectory in this area would continue unabated, culminating in the Liquid Glass abomination. Now that Alan Dye has left Apple, history is repeating itself: the very same Apple bloggers and podcasters are repeating themselves &#8211; surely now that Alan Dye is gone, GUI design at Apple will finally surely improve again. The possibility that GUI design at Apple does not hinge on the whims of just one person, but that instead the entire company has lost all sense of taste and craftmanship in this area does not cross their minds. Everyone around Jony Ive and Alan Dye, both below, alongside, and above them, had to sign off on Apple&#8217;s recent direction in GUI design, and the idea that the entire company would blindly follow whatever one person says, quality be damned, would have me far more worried as an Apple fan. At this point, it&#8217;s clear that Apple&#8217;s inability to design and build quality user interfaces is not the fault of just one fall guy, but an institutional problem. Anyone expecting a turnaround just because Ive Dye is gone isn&#8217;t seeing the burning forest through the trees.]]>

Luckily, Declan Chidlow at HTMLHell details a few of them so we can all scratch shake our heads in disbelief. But there are far more obscure tags which are perhaps less visually dazzling but equally or even more interesting. If you&#8217;re younger, this might very well be your introduction to them. If you&#8217;re older, this still might be an introduction, but also possibly a trip down memory lane or a flashback to the horrors of the first browser war. It depends. ↫ Declan Chidlow at HTMLHell I think my favourite is the dir tag, intended to be used to display lists of files and directories. We&#8217;re supposed to use list tags now to achieve the same result, but I do kind of like the idea of having a dedicated tag to indicate files, and perhaps have browsers render these lists in the same way the file manager of the platform it&#8217;s running on does. I don&#8217;t know if that was possible, but it seems like the logical continuation of a hypothetical dir tag. Anyway, should we implement bgsound on OSNews?]]>

        <![CDATA[Christmas is already behind us, but since this is an announcement from 11 December &#8211; that I missed &#8211; I&#8217;m calling this a very interesting and surprising Christmas present. The team and I are beyond excited to share what we&#8217;ve been cooking up over the last little while: a full desktop environment running on QNX 8.0, with support for self-hosted compilation! This environment both makes it easier for newly-minted QNX developers to get started with building for QNX, but it also vastly simplifies the process of porting Linux applications and libraries to QNX 8.0. ↫ John Hanam at the QNX Developer Blog What we have here is QNX 8.0 running the Xfce desktop environment on Wayland, a whole slew of build and development tools like clang, gcc, git, etc.), a ton of popular code editors and IDEs, a web browser (looks like GNOME Web?), access to all the ports on the QNX Open-Source Dashboard, and more. For now, it&#8217;s only available as a Qemu image to run on top of Ubuntu, but the plan is to also release an x86 image in the coming months so you can run this directly on real hardware. This isn&#8217;t quite the same as the QNX of old with its unique Photon microGUI, but it&#8217;s been known for a while now that Photon hasn&#8217;t been actively developed in a long time and is basically abandoned. Running Xfce on Wayland is obviously a much more sensible solution, and one that&#8217;s quite future-proof, too. As a certified QNX desktop enthusiast of yore, I can&#8217;t wait for the x86 image to arrive so I can try this out properly. There are downsides. This image, too, is encumbered by annoying non-commercial license requirements and sign-ups, and this also wouldn&#8217;t be the first time QNX starts an enthusiast effort, only to abandon it shortly after. Buyer beware, then, but I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[We&#8217;ve got more X11-related news this day, the day of Xmas. Phoenix is a new X server, written from scratch in Zig (not a fork of Xorg server). This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server. ↫ Phoenix&#8217; readme page Phoenix will only support a modern subset of the X11 protocol, focusing on making sure modern applications from roughly the last 20 years or so work. It also takes quite a few pages out of the Wayland playbook by not having a server driver interface and by having a compositor included. On top of that, it will isolate applications from each other, and won&#8217;t have a single framebuffer for all displays, instead allowing different refresh rates for individual displays. The project also intends to develop new standards to support things like per-monitor DPI, among many other features. That&#8217;s a lot of features and capabilities to promise for an X server, and much like Wayland, the way they aim to get there is by effectively gutting traditional X and leaving a ton of cruft behind. The use of Zig is also interesting, as it can catch some issues before they affect any users thanks to Zig&#8217;s runtime safety option. At least it&#8217;s not yet another thing written in Rust like every other project competing with an established project. I think this look like an incredibly interesting project to keep an eye on, and I hope more people join the effort. Competition and fresh, new ideas are good, especially now that everything is gravitating towards Wayland &#8211; we need alternatives to promote the sharing of ideas.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Elementary OS, the user-friendly Linux distribution with its own unique desktop environment and applications, just released elementary OS 8.1. Its minor version number belies just how big of a punch this update packs, so don&#8217;t be fooled here. We released elementary OS 8 last November with a new Secure Session—powered by Wayland—that ensures applications respect your privacy and consent, a brand new Dock with productive multitasking and window management features, expanded access to cross-platform apps, a revamped updates experience, and new features and settings that empower our diverse community through Inclusive Design. Over the last year we’ve continued to build upon that work to deliver new features and fix issues based on your feedback, plus we’ve improved support for a range of devices including HiDPI and Multi-touch devices. ↫ Danielle Foré at the elementary OS blog The biggest change from a lower-level perspective is that elementary OS 8.1 changes the default session to Wayland, leaving the X11 session as a fallback in case of issues. Since the release of elementary OS 8, a ton of progress has been made in improving the Wayland session, fixing remaining issues, and so on, and the team now feels it&#8217;s ready to serve as the default session. Related to this is a new security feature in the Wayland session where the rest of the screen gets dimmed when a password dialog pops up, and other windows can&#8217;t steal focus. The switch to Wayland also allowed the team to bring fractional scaling to elementary OS with 8.1. Elementary OS is based on Ubuntu, and this new release brings an updated Hardware Enablement stack, which brings things like Linux 6.14 and Mesa 25. This is also the first release with support for ARM64 devices that can use UEFI, which includes quite a few popular ARM devices. Of course, the ARM64 version comes as a separate ISO. Furthermore, there&#8217;s a ton of improvements to the dock &#8211; which was released with 8 as a brand-new replacement for the venerable Plank &#8211; including bringing back some features that were lost in the transition from Plank to the new dock. Animations are smoother, elementary OS&#8217; application store has seen a slew of improvements from clearer licensing information, to a controller icon for games that support them, to a label identifying applications that offer in-app purchases, and more. There&#8217;s a lot more here, like the accessibility improvements we talked about a few months ago, and tons more.]]>

        <![CDATA[If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to try FreeBSD on a laptop, take note – 2025 has brought transformative changes. The Foundation’s ambitious Laptop Support &#38; Usability Project is systematically addressing the gaps that have held FreeBSD back on modern laptop hardware.&#160; The project started in 2024 Q4 and covers areas including Wi-Fi, graphics, audio, installer, and sleep states. 2025 has been its first full year, and with a financial commitment of over $750k to date there has been substantial progress. ↫ Alice Sowerby for the FreeBSD Foundation I think that&#8217;s an understatement. As part of this effort, FreeBSD introduced support for Wi-Fi 4 and 5 in 2025, with 6 being worked on, and sound support has been greatly improved as well, with new tools and better support for automatic sound redirection for HDA cards. Another major area of improvement is support for various forms of sleep and wake, with modern standby coming in FreeBSD 15.1, and possibly hibernate in 15.2. On top of all this, there&#8217;s the usual graphics drivers updates, as well as changes to the installer to make it a bit more friendly to desktop use cases. The FreeBSD project is clearly taking desktop and especially laptop seriously lately, and they&#8217;re putting their money and developers where their mouth is. Add in the fact that FreeBSD already has pretty decent Wayland support, and it the platform will be able to continue to offer the latest KDE releases (and GNOME, if they figure out replacements for its systemd dependencies). With progress like this, we&#8217;re definitely going to see more and more people making the move to FreeBSD for desktop and laptop use over the coming years.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144046/on-the-immortality-of-microsoft-word/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If Excel rules the world, Word rules the legal profession. Jordan Bryan published a great article explaining why this is the case, and why this is unlikely to change any time soon, no matter how many people from the technology world think they can change this reality. Microsoft Word can never be replaced. OpenAI could build superintelligence surpassing human cognition in every conceivable dimension, rendering all human labor obsolete, and Microsoft Word will survive. Future contracts defining the land rights to distant galaxies will undoubtedly be drafted in Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word is immortal. ↫ Jordan Bryan at The Redline by Version Story Bryan cites two main reasons underpinning Microsoft Word&#8217;s immortality in the legal profession. First, lawyers need the various formatting options Word provides, and alternatives often suggested by outsiders, like Markdown, don&#8217;t come close to offering even 5% of the various formatting features lawyers and other writers of legal documents require. By the time you add all those features back to Markdown, you&#8217;ve recreated Word, but infinitely worse and more obtuse. Also, and this is entirely my personal opinion, Markdown sucks. Second, and this one you&#8217;ve surely heard before: Word&#8217;s .docx format is effectively a network protocol. Everyone in the legal profession uses it, can read it, work with it, mark it up, apply corrections, and so on &#8211; from judges to lawyers to clients. If you try to work with, say, Google Docs, instead, you create a ton of friction in every interaction you have with other people in the legal profession. I vividly remember this from my 15 years as a translator &#8211; every single document you ever worked with was a Microsoft Office document. Sure, the translation agency standing between the end client and the translator might have abstracted the document into a computer-aided translation tool like Trados, but you&#8217;re still working with .docx, and the translated document sent to the client is still .docx, and needs to look identical to the source, just in a different language. In the technology world, there&#8217;s a lot of people who come barging into some other profession or field, claiming to know everything, and suggest to &#8220;just do x&#8221;, without any deference to how said profession or field actually operates. &#8220;Just use Markdown and git&#8221; even if the people involved have no clue what a markup language even is let alone what git is; &#8220;just use LibreOffice&#8221; even if the people involved will skewer you for altering the formatting of a document even ever so slightly; we all know examples of this. An industry tends to work a certain way not because they&#8217;re stupid or haven&#8217;t seen the light &#8211; it tends to work that way because there&#8217;s a thousand little reasons you&#8217;re not aware of that make that way the best way.]]>

      <title>A look back: LANPAR, the first spreadsheet</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144044/a-look-back-lanpar-the-first-spreadsheet/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In 1979, VisiCalc was released for the Apple II, and to this day, many consider it the very first spreadsheet program. Considering just how important spreadsheets have become since then &#8211; Excel rules the world &#8211; the first spreadsheet program is definitely an interesting topic to dive into. It turns out that while VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet program for home computers, it&#8217;s not actually the first spreadsheet program, period. That honour goes to LANPAR, created ten years before VisiCalc. Ten years before VisiCalc, two engineers at Bell Canada came up with a pretty neat idea. At the time, organizational budgets were created using a program that ran on a mainframe system. If a manager wanted to make a change to the budget model, that might take programmers months to create an updated version. Rene Pardo and Remy Landau discussed the problem and asked “what if the managers could make their own budget forms as they would normally write them?” And with that, a new idea was created: the spreadsheet program. The new spreadsheet was called LANPAR, for “LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random” (but really it was a mash-up of their last names: LANdau and PARdo). ↫ Jim Hall at Technically We Write While there wasn&#8217;t a graphical user interface on the screen with a grid and icons and everything else we associate with a spreadsheet today, it was still very much a spreadsheet. Individual cells were delinianated with semicolons, you could write down formulas to manipulate these cells, and the program could do forward referencing. The idea was to make it so easy to use, managers at Dell Canada could make budgeting changes overnight, instead of having programmers take weeks or months to do so. I&#8217;m not particularly well-versed in Excel and spreadsheets in general, but I can definitely imagine advanced users no longer really seeing the grids and numbers as individual entities, instead visualising everything much more closely to what LANPAR did.

      <source:markdown>In 1979, VisiCalc was released for the Apple II, and to this day, many consider it the very first spreadsheet program. Considering just how important spreadsheets have become since then – Excel rules the world – the first spreadsheet program is definitely an interesting topic to dive into. It turns out that while VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet program for home computers, it’s not actually the first spreadsheet program, period. That honour goes to LANPAR, created ten years before VisiCalc. Ten years before VisiCalc, two engineers at Bell Canada came up with a pretty neat idea. At the time, organizational budgets were created using a program that ran on a mainframe system. If a manager wanted to make a change to the budget model, that might take programmers months to create an updated version. Rene Pardo and Remy Landau discussed the problem and asked “what if the managers could make their own budget forms as they would normally write them?” And with that, a new idea was created: the spreadsheet program. The new spreadsheet was called LANPAR, for “LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random” (but really it was a mash-up of their last names: LANdau and PARdo). ↫ Jim Hall at Technically We Write While there wasn’t a graphical user interface on the screen with a grid and icons and everything else we associate with a spreadsheet today, it was still very much a spreadsheet. Individual cells were delinianated with semicolons, you could write down formulas to manipulate these cells, and the program could do forward referencing. The idea was to make it so easy to use, managers at Dell Canada could make budgeting changes overnight, instead of having programmers take weeks or months to do so. I’m not particularly well-versed in Excel and spreadsheets in general, but I can definitely imagine advanced users no longer really seeing the grids and numbers as individual entities, instead visualising everything much more closely to what LANPAR did. Like Neo when he finally peers through the Matrix.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[Mark Weiser has written a really interesting article about just how desirable new computing environments, like VR, &#8220;AI&#8221; agents, and so on, really are. On the topic of &#8220;AI&#8221; agents, he writes: Take intelligent agents. The idea, as near as I can tell, is that the ideal computer should be like a human being, only more obedient. Anything so insidiously appealing should immediately give pause. Why should a computer be anything like a human being? Are airplanes like birds, typewriters like pens, alphabets like mouths, cars like horses? Are human interactions so free of trouble, misunderstandings, and ambiguity that they represent a desirable computer interface goal? Further, it takes a lot of time and attention to build and maintain a smoothly running team of people, even a pair of people. A computer that I must talk to, give commands to, or have a relationship with (much less be intimate with), is a computer that is too much the center of attention. ↫ Mark Weiser That&#8217;s one hell of a laser-focused takedown of &#8220;AI&#8221; tools in modern computing. When it comes to voice input, he argues that it&#8217;s too intrusive, too attention-grabbing, and a good tool is supposed to be the exact opposite of that. Voice input, especially when there&#8217;s other people around, puts the interface at the center of everyone&#8216;s attention, and that&#8217;s not what you should want. With regards to virtual reality, he notes that it replaces your entire perception with nothing but interface, all around you, making it as much the center of attention as it could be. What&#8217;s most fascinating about this article and its focus on &#8220;AI&#8221; agents, virtual reality, and more, is that it was published in January 1994. All the same questions, worries, and problems in computing we deal with today, were just as much topics of debate over thirty years ago. It&#8217;s remarkable how you could copy and paste many of the paragraphs written by Weiser in 1994 into the modern day, and they&#8217;d be just applicable now as they were then. I bet many of you had no idea the quoted paragraph was over thirty years old. Mark Weiser was a visionary computer scientist, and had a long career at Xerox PARC, eventually landing him the role of Chief Technology Officer at PARC in 1996. He coined the term &#8220;ubiquitous computing&#8221; in 1988, the idea that computers are everywhere, in the form of wearables, handhelds, and larger displays &#8211; very prescient for 1988. He argued that computers should be unobtrusive, get out of your way, help you get things done that aren&#8217;t managing and shepherding the computer itself, and most of all, that computers should make users feel calm. Sadly, he passed away in 1999, at the age of 46, clearly way too early for someone with such astonishing forward-looking insight into computing. Looking at what computers have become today, and what kinds of interfaces the major technology companies are trying to shove down our throats, we clearly strayed far from Weiser&#8217;s vision. Modern computers and interfaces are the exact opposite of unobtrusive and calming, and often hinder the things you&#8217;re trying to get done more than they should. I wonder what Weiser would think about computing in 2025.]]>

      <title>Mozilla’s new CEO: Firefox will become an “AI browser”</title>

        <![CDATA[In recent years, things have not been going well for Mozilla. Firefox&#8217;s market share is a rounding error, and financially, the company is effectively entirely dependent on free money from Google for making it the default search engine in Firefox. Mozilla&#8217;s tried to stem the bleeding with deeply unpopular efforts like focusing on online advertising and cramming more and more &#8220;AI&#8221; into Firefox, but so far, nothing has worked, and more and more of the remaining small group of Firefox users are moving to modded versions of Firefox without the &#8220;AI&#8221; nonsense and other anti-features. The task of turning the tide is now up to Mozilla&#8217;s new CEO, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, who took up the role starting today. In his first message to the public in his new role as CEO of Mozilla, he lays out his vision for the future of the company. What are his plans for Mozilla&#8217;s most important product, the Firefox web browser? Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions. ↫ Anthony Enzor-DeMeo So far, the &#8220;AI&#8221; additions to Firefox have not exactly been met with thunderous applause &#8211; to put it mildly &#8211; and I don&#8217;t see how increasing these efforts is going to magically turn that sentiment around. I&#8217;d hazard a guess that Firefox users, in particular, are probably quite averse to &#8220;AI&#8221; and what it stands for, further strengthening the feeling that the people leading Mozilla seem a little bit out of touch with their own users. Add to this the obvious fact that &#8220;AI&#8221; is a bubble waiting to pop, and I&#8217;m left wondering how investing in &#8220;AI&#8221; now is going to do anything but make Mozilla waste even more money. I don&#8217;t want Firefox to fail, as it is currently the only browser that isn&#8217;t Chrome, Chrome in a trench coat, or Safari, but it seems Mozilla is trying to do everything to chase away what few users Firefox had left. In the short term, we can at least use modified versions of Firefox that have the &#8220;AI&#8221; nonsense and other anti-features removed, but for the long term, we&#8217;re going to need something else if Mozilla keeps going down the same path it&#8217;s been going in recent years. The only viable long-term alternative is Servo, but that&#8217;s still a long way off from being a usable day-to-day browser. The browser landscape ain&#8217;t looking so hot, and this new Mozilla CEO is not making me feel any better.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Back in 2017 I wrote about a technique for creating closures in C using JIT-compiled wrapper. It’s neat, though rarely necessary in real programs, so I don’t think about it often. I applied it to qsort, which sadly accepts no context pointer. More practical would be working around insufficient custom allocator interfaces, to create allocation functions at run-time bound to a particular allocation region. I’ve learned a lot since I last wrote about this subject, and a recent article had me thinking about it again, and how I could do better than before. In this article I will enhance Win32 window procedure callbacks with a fifth argument, allowing us to more directly pass extra context. I’m using w64devkit on x64, but the everything here should work out-of-the-box with any x64 toolchain that speaks GNU assembly. ↫ Chris Wellons Sometimes, people get upset when I mention something is out of my wheelhouse, so just for those people, here&#8217;s an article well outside of my wheelhouse.

        <![CDATA[Any computing device will inevitably get a custom operating system &#8211; whether based on an existing operating system or something entirely custom &#8211; and of course, Kobo e-readers are no exception.

Basic hardware capabilities like Wi-Fi and power management are also supported, and it has online update support, too. The current release is already two years old, sadly, so I&#8217;m not sure how active the project is at this point. I wanted to highlight it here since something like this is a great way to liberate your Kobo device if, for some reason, Kobo ever started making their devices worse through updates, or the company shutters its services.

      <title>Haiku gets new Go port</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144019/haiku-gets-new-go-port/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[There&#8217;s a new Haiku monthly activity report, and this one&#8217;s a true doozy. Let&#8217;s start with the biggest news. The most notable development in November was the introduction of a port of the Go programming language, version 1.18. This is still a few years old (from 2022; the current is Go 1.25), but it’s far newer than the previous Go port to Haiku (1.4 from 2014); and unlike the previous port which was never in the package repositories, this one is now already available there (for x86_64 at least) and can be installed via pkgman. ↫ Haiku activity report As the project notes, they&#8217;re still a few versions behind, but at least it&#8217;s a lot more modern of an implementation than they had before. Now that it&#8217;s in the repositories for Haiku, it might also attract more people to work on the port, potentially bringing even newer versions to the BeOS-inspired operating system. Welcome as it may be, this new Go port isn&#8217;t the only big ticket item this month. Haiku can now gracefully recover from an app_server crash, something it used to be able to do a long time ago, but which was broken for a long time. The app_server is Haiku&#8217;s display server and window manager, so the ability to restart it at runtime after a crash, and have it reconnect with still-running applications, is incredibly welcome. As far as I can tell, all modern operating systems can do this by now, so it&#8217;s great to have this functionality restored in Haiku. Of course, aside from these two big improvements, there&#8217;s the usual load of fixes and changes in applications, drivers, and other components of the operating system.]]>

      <title>Rethinking sudo with object capabilities</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/144017/rethinking-sudo-with-object-capabilities/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alpine Linux maintainer Ariadne Conill has published a very interesting blog post about the shortcomings of both sudo and doas, and offers a potential different way of achieving the same goals as those tools. Systems built around identity-based access control tend to rely on ambient authority: policy is centralized and errors in the policy configuration or bugs in the policy engine can allow attackers to make full use of that ambient authority. In the case of a SUID binary like doas or sudo, that means an attacker can obtain root access in the event of a bug or misconfiguration. What if there was a better way? Instead of thinking about privilege escalation as becoming root for a moment, what if it meant being handed a narrowly scoped capability, one with just enough authority to perform a specific action and nothing more? Enter the object-capability model. ↫ Ariadne Conill To bring this approach to life, they created a tool called capsudo. Instead of temporarily changing your identity, capsudo can grant far more fine-grained capabilities that match the exact task you&#8217;re trying to accomplish. As an example, Conill details mounting and unmounting &#8211; with capsudo, you can not only grant the ability for a user to mount and unmount whatever device, but also allow the user to only mount or unmount just one specific device. Another example given is how capsudo can be used to give a service account user to only those resources the account needs to perform its tasks. Of course, Conill explains all of this way better than I ever could, with actual example commands and more details. Conill happens to be the same person who created Wayback, illustrating that they have a tendency to look at problems in a unique and interesting way. I&#8217;m not smart enough to determine if this approach makes sense compared to sudo or doas, but the way it&#8217;s described it does feel like a superior, more secure solution.]]>

        <![CDATA[Unix has been enormously successful over the past 55 years. It started out as a small experiment to develop a time-sharing system (i.e., a multi-user operating system) at AT&#38;T Bell Labs. The goal was to take a few core principles to their logical conclusion. The OS bundled many small tools that were easy to combine, as it was illustrated by a famous exchange between Donald Knuth and Douglas McIlroy in 1986.

My personal favourite story from the article &#8211; which is just an aside, to illustrate that even the asides are great &#8211; is that when Australia joined Usenet in 1983, new posts to Usenet were delivered to the country by airmail. On magnetic tape. Once per week. The overarching theme here is that the early days of UNIX, as documented on Usenet, were a fascinating wild west of implementations, hacks, and personalities, which, yes, clashed with each other, but also spread untold amounts of information, knowledge, and experience to every corner of the world. I hope Nyéki will write more of these articles.]]>

Then there's a few key requirements you should be aware of: Ideally, you're a large object like a moon or a planet; scientists suspect you also have an atmosphere and water; plus, you should orbit your star from a nice mid-range distance — in the "Goldilocks Zone" of habitability.

COSMIC is a brand new desktop environment by System76, written in Rust, and after quite some time in development, it&#8217;s now out in the wild as a stable release. Today is special not only in that it’s the culmination of over three years of work, but even more so in that System76 has built a complete desktop environment for the open source community. We’re proud of this contribution to the open source ecosystem. COSMIC is built on the ethos that the best open source projects enable people to not only use them, but to build with them. COSMIC is modular and composable. It’s the flagship experience for Pop!_OS in its own way, and can be adapted by anyone that wants to build their own unique user experience for Linux. ↫ Carl Richell You don&#8217;t need to run Pop!_OS to try out COSMIC, as it&#8217;s already available on a variety of other distributions (although it may take a bit for this stable version to land in the respective repositories).]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[I&#8217;m sure most of us here are aware of the bright red-and-yellow colour scheme called &#8220;Hot Dog Stand&#8221;, included in Windows 3.1. While it&#8217;s not the only truly garish colour scheme included in Windows 3.1, its name probably did a lot to make it stand out from the others. There&#8217;s been a ton of speculation about the origins of the colour scheme, and why it was included in Windows 3.1, but it seems nobody ever bothered to look for someone who actually worked on the Windows 3.1 user interface &#8211; until now. PC Gamer&#8217;s Wes Fenlon contacted Virginia Howlett, Microsoft&#8217;s first user interface designer who joined the company in 1985, and asked her about the infamous colour scheme. It turns out that the origin story for the infamous colour scheme is rather mundane. In Howlett&#8217;s own words: I do remember some discussion about whether we should include it, and some snarky laughter. But it was not intended as a joke. It was not inspired by any hot dog stands, and it was not included as an example of a bad interface—although it was one. It was just a garish choice, in case somebody out there liked ugly bright red and yellow. ↫ Virginia Howlett, quoted by Wes Fenlon in PC Gamer Howlett then lists a few other included colour schemes that were just as garish, or even more so, as examples to underline her point. Personally, I&#8217;m a huge proponent of allowing users to make their interfaces as ugly and garish as they want, as the only arbiter on what&#8217;s on your screen is you, and nobody else. Hot Dog Stand and similar garish themes need to make a comeback, because there&#8217;s bound to be some people out there whose vibes align with it.]]>

        <![CDATA[IBM owns Red Hat which in turn runs Fedora, the popular desktop Linux distribution. Sadly, shit rolls downhill, so we&#8217;re starting to see some worrying signs that Fedora is going to be used a means to push &#8220;AI&#8221;. Case in point, this article in the Fedora Magazine: Generative AI systems are changing the way people interact with computers. MCP (model context protocol) is a way that enables generate AI systems to run commands and use tools to enable live, conversational interaction with systems. Using the new linux-mcp-server, let’s walk through how you can talk with your Fedora system for understanding your system and getting help troubleshooting it! ↫ Máirín Duffy and Brian Smith at Fedora Magazine This &#8220;linux-mcp-server&#8221; tool is developed by IBM&#8217;s Red Hat, and of course, IBM has a vested interest in further increasing the size of the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble. As such, it makes sense from their perspective to start pushing &#8220;AI&#8221; services and tools all the way down to the Fedora community, ending up with articles like this one. What&#8217;s sad is that even in this article, which surely uses the best possible examples, it&#8217;s hard to see how any of it could possibly be any faster than doing the example tasks without the &#8220;help&#8221; of an &#8220;AI&#8221;. In the first example, the &#8220;AI&#8221; is supposed to figure out why the computer is having Wi-Fi connection issues, and while it does figure that out, the solutions it presents are really dumb and utterly wrong. Most notably, even though this is an article about running these tools on a Fedora system, written for Fedora Magazine, the &#8220;AI&#8221; stubbornly insists on using apt for every solution, which is a basic, stupid mistake that doesn&#8217;t exactly instill confidence in any of its other findings being accurate. The second example involves asking the &#8220;AI&#8221; to explain how much disk space the system is using, and why. The &#8220;prompt&#8221; (the human-created &#8220;question&#8221; the &#8220;AI&#8221; is supposed to &#8220;answer&#8221;) is bonkers long &#8211; it&#8217;s a 117 words long monstrosity, formatted into several individual questions &#8211; and the output is so verbose and it takes such a scattershot approach that following-up on everything is going to take a huge amount of time. Within that same time frame, it would&#8217;ve been not only much faster, but also much more user-friendly to just open Filelight (installed by default as part of KDE), which creates a nice diagram which instantly shows you what is taking up space, and why. The third example is about creating an update readiness report for upgrading from Fedora 42 to Fedora 43, and its &#8220;prompt&#8221; is even longer at 190 words, and writing that up with all those individual questions must&#8217;ve taken more time than to just&#8230; Do a simple dry-run of a dnf system upgrade which gets you like 90% of the way there. Here, too, the &#8220;AI&#8221; blurts out so much information, much of which entirely useless, that going through it all takes more time than just manually checking up on a dnf dry run and peaking at your disk space usage. All this effort to set all of this up, and so much effort to carefully craft complex &#8220;prompts&#8221;, only to end up with clearly wrong information, and way too much superfluous information that just ends up distracting you from the task you set out to accmplish. Is this really the kind of future of computing we&#8217;re supposed to be rooting for? Is this the kind of stuff Fedora&#8217;s new &#8220;AI&#8221; policy is supposed to enable? If so, I&#8217;m afraid the disconnect between Fedora&#8217;s leadership and whatever its users actually use Fedora for is far, far wider than I imagined.]]>
