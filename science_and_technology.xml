      <title>MV 950 Toy: an emulator of the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistor computer</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143402/mv-950-toy-an-emulator-of-the-metrovick-950-the-first-commercial-transistor-computer/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After researching the first commercial transistor computer, the British Metrovick 950, Nina Kalinina wrote an emulator, simple assembler, and some additional &#8220;toys&#8221; (her word) so we can enjoy this machine today. First, what, exactly, is the Metrovick 950? Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistor computer, is an early British computer, released in 1956. It is a direct descendant of the Manchester Baby (1948), the first electronic stored-program computer ever. ↫ Nina Kalinina The Baby, formally known as Small-Scale Experimental Machine, was a foundation for the Manchester Mark I (1949). Mark I found commercial success as the Ferranti Mark I. A few years later, Manchester University built a variant of Mark I that used magnetic drum memory instead of Williams tubes and transistors instead of valves. This computer was called the Manchester Transistor Computer (1955). Engineers from Metropolitan-Vickers released a streamlined, somewhat simplified version of the Transistor Computer as Metrovick 950. The emulator she developed is &#8220;only&#8221; compatible on a source code level, and emulates &#8220;the CPU, a teleprinter with a paper tape punch/reader, a magnetic tape storage device, and a plotter&#8221;, at 200-300 operations per second. It&#8217;s complete enough you can play Lunar Lander on it, because is a computer you can&#8217;t play games on really a computer? Nina didn&#8217;t just create this emulator and its related components, but also wrote a ton of documentation to help you understand the machine and to get started. There&#8217;s an introduction to programming and using the Metrovick 950 emulator, additional notes on programming the emulator, and much more. She also posted a long thread on Fedi with a ton more details and background information, which is a great read, as well. This is amazing work, and interesting not just to programmers interested in ancient computers, but also to historians and people who really put the retro in retrocomputing.]]>

      <title>Multikernel architecture proposed for Linux</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143398/multikernel-architecture-proposed-for-linux/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A very exciting set of kernel patches have just been proposed for the Linux kernel, adding multikernel support to Linux. This patch series introduces multikernel architecture support, enabling multiple independent kernel instances to coexist and communicate on a single physical machine. Each kernel instance can run on dedicated CPU cores while sharing the underlying hardware resources. ↫ Cong Wang on the LKML The idea is that you can run multiple instances of the Linux kernel on different CPU cores using kexec, with a dedicated IPI framework taking care of communication between these kernels. The benefits for fault isolation and security is obvious, and it supposedly uses less resources than running virtual machines through kvm and similar technologies. The main feature I&#8217;m interested in is that this would potentially allow for &#8220;kernel handover&#8221;, in which the system goes from using one kernel to the other. I wonder if this would make it possible to implement a system similar to what Android currently uses for updates, where new versions are installed alongside the one you&#8217;re running right now, with the system switching over to the new version upon reboot. If you could do something similar with this technology without even having to reboot, that would be quite amazing and a massive improvement to the update experience. It&#8217;s obviously just a proposal for now, and there will be much, much discussion to follow I&#8217;m sure, but the possibilities are definitely exciting.]]>

Today&#8217;s topic is no exception &#8211; GEM was developed by Lee Jay Lorenzen, who worked at Xerox and wished to create a cheaper, less resource-intensive alternative to the Xerox Star, which he got to do at DRI after leaving Xerox. His work was then shown off to Atari, who were interested in using it. The entire situation was pretty hectic for a while: DRI’s graphics group worked on the PC version of GEM on MS-DOS; Atari developers were porting it to Apple Lisas running CP/M-68K; and Loveman was building GEMDOS. Against all odds, they succeeded. The operating system for Atari ST consisting of GEM running on top of GEMDOS was named TOS which simply meant “the operating system”, although many believed “T” actually stood for “Tramiel”. Atari 520 ST, soon nicknamed “Jackintosh”,&#160;was introduced at the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas&#160;and became an immediate hit. GEM ran smoothly on the powerful ST’s hardware, and there were no clones to worry about. Atari developed its branch of GEM independently of Digital Research until 1993, when the Atari ST line of computers was discontinued. ↫ Nemanja Trifunovic at Programming at the right level Other than through articles like these and the occasional virtual machine, I have no experience with the various failed graphical user interfaces of the 1980s, since I was too young at the time. Even from the current day, though, it&#8217;s easy to see how all of them can be traced back directly to the work done at Xerox, and just how much we owe to the people working there at the time. Now that the technology industry is as massive as it is, with the stakes being so high, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll ever see a place like Xerox PARC ever again. Everything is secretive now, and if a line of research doesn&#8217;t obviously lead to massive short-term gains, it&#8217;s canned before it even starts. The golden age of wild, random computer research without a profit motive is clearly behind us, and that&#8217;s sad.]]>

      <title>Dark patterns killed my wife’s Windows 11 installation</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143376/dark-patterns-killed-my-wifes-windows-11-installation/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Last night, my wife looks up from her computer, troubled. She tells me she can&#8217;t log into her computer running Windows 11, as every time she enters the PIN code to her account, the login screen throws up a cryptic error: &#8220;Your credentials could not be verified&#8221;. She&#8217;s using the correct PIN code, so that surely isn&#8217;t it. We opt for the gold standard in troubleshooting and perform a quick reboot, but that doesn&#8217;t fix it. My initial instinct is that since she&#8217;s using an online account instead of a local one, perhaps Microsoft is having some server issues? A quick check online indicates that no, Microsoft&#8217;s servers seem to be running fine, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t even know if that would have an effect on logging into Windows in the first place. The Windows 11 login screen does give us a link to click in case you forget your PIN code. Despite the fact the PIN code she&#8217;s entering is correct, we try to go through this process to see if it goes anywhere. This is where things really start to get weird. A few dialogs flash in and out of existence, until it&#8217;s showing us a dialog telling us to insert a security USB key of some sort, which we don&#8217;t have. Dismissing it gives us an option to try other login methods, including a basic password login. This, too, doesn&#8217;t work; just like with the PIN code, Windows 11 claims the accurate, correct password my wife is entering is invalid (just to be safe, we tested it by logging into her Microsoft account on her phone, which works just fine). In the account selection menu in the bottom-left, an ominous new account mysteriously appears: WsiAccount. The next option we try is to actually change the PIN code. This doesn&#8217;t work either. Windows wants us to use a second factor using my wife&#8217;s phone number, but this throws up another weird error, this time claiming the SMS service to send the code isn&#8217;t working. A quick check online once again confirms the service seems to be working just fine for everybody else. I&#8217;m starting to get really stumped and frustrated. Of course, during all of this, we&#8217;re both searching the web to find anything that might help us figure out what&#8217;s going on. None of our searches bring up anything useful, and none of our findings seem to be related to or match up with the issue we&#8217;re having. While she&#8217;s looking at her phone and I&#8217;m browsing on my Fedora/KDE PC next to hers, she quickly mentions she&#8217;s getting a notification that OneDrive is full, which is odd, since she doesn&#8217;t use OneDrive for anything. We take this up as a quick sidequest, and we check up on her OneDrive account on her phone. As OneDrive loads, our jaws drop in amazement: a big banner warning is telling her she&#8217;s using over 5500% of her 5GB free account. We look at each other and burst out laughing. We exchange some confused words, and then we realise what is going on: my wife just got a brand new Samsung Galaxy S25, and Samsung has some sort of deal with Microsoft to integrate its services into Samsung&#8217;s variant of Android. Perhaps during the process of transferring data and applications from her old to her new phone, OneDrive syncing got turned on? A quick trip to the Samsung Gallery application confirms our suspicions: the phone is synchronising over 280GB of photos and videos to OneDrive. My wife was never asked for consent to turn this feature on, so it must&#8217;ve been turned on by default. We quickly turn it off, delete the 280GB of photos and videos from OneDrive, and move on to the real issue at hand. Since nothing seems to work, and none of what we find online brings us any closer to what&#8217;s going on with her Windows 11 installation, we figured it&#8217;s time to bring out the big guns. For the sake of brevity, let&#8217;s run through the things we tried. Booting into safe mode doesn&#8217;t work; we get the same login problems. Trying to uninstall the latest updates, an option in WinRE, doesn&#8217;t work, and throws up an unspecified error. We try to use a restore point, but despite knowing for 100% certain the feature to periodically create restore points is enabled, the only available restore point is from 2022, and is located on a drive other than her root drive (or &#8220;C:\&#8221; in Windows parlance). Using the reset option in WinRE doesn&#8217;t work either, as it also throws up an error, this time about not having enough free space. I also walk through a few more complex suggestions, like a few manual registry hacks related to the original error using cmd.exe in WinRE. None of it yields any results. It&#8217;s now approaching midnight, and we need to get up early to drop the kids off at preschool, so I tell my wife I&#8217;ll reinstall her copy of Windows 11 tomorrow. We&#8217;re out of ideas. The next day, I decide to give it one last go before opting for the trouble of going through a reinstallation. The one idea I still have left is to enable the hidden administrator account in Windows 11, which gives you password-free access to what is basically Windows&#8217; root account. It involves booting into WinRE, loading up cmd.exe, and replacing utilman.exe in system32 with cmd.exe: If you then proceed to boot into Windows 11 and click on the Accessibility icon in the bottom-right, it will open &#8220;utilman.exe&#8221;, but since that&#8217;s just cmd.exe with the utilman.exe name, you get a command prompt to work with, right on the login screen. From here, you can launch regedit, find the correct key, change a REG_BINARY, save, and reboot. At the login screen, you&#8217;ll see a new &#8220;adminstrator&#8221; account with full access to your computer. During the various reboots, I do some more web searching, and I stumble upon a post on]]>

      <title>Intel to build x86 CPUs with NVIDIA graphics, most likely spelling the end of ARC</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Intel is in very dire straits, and as such, the company needs investments and partnerships more than anything. Today, NVIDIA and Intel announced just such a partnership, in which NVIDIA will invest $5 billion into the troubled chip giant, while the two companies will develop products that combine Intel&#8217;s x86 processors with NVIDIA&#8217;s GPUs. For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs. ↫ NVIDIA press release My immediate reaction to this news was to worry about the future of Intel&#8217;s ARC graphics efforts. Just as the latest crop of their ARC GPUs have received a ton of good press and positive feedback, with some of their cards becoming the go-to suggestion for a budget-friendly but almost on-par alternative to offerings from NVIDIA and AMD, it would be a huge blow to user choice and competition if Intel were to abandon the effort. I think this news pretty much spells the end for the ARC graphics effort. Making dedicated GPUs able to compete with AMD and NVIDIA must come at a pretty big financial cost for Intel, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they&#8217;ve been itching to find an excuse to can the whole project. With NVIDIA GPUs fulfilling the role of more powerful integrated GPUs, all Intel really needs is a skeleton crew developing the basic integrated GPUs for cheaper and non-gaming oriented devices, which would be a lot cheaper to maintain. For just $5 billion dollars, NVIDIA most likely just eliminated a budding competitor in the GPU space. That&#8217;s cheap.]]>

        <![CDATA[All good things come to an end eventually, and that includes support for 32bit Windows in Steam. As of January 1 2026, Steam will stop supporting systems running 32-bit versions of Windows. Windows 10 32-bit is the only 32-bit version that is currently supported by Steam and is only in use on 0.01% of systems reported through the Steam Hardware Survey. Windows 10 64-bit will still be supported and 32-bit games will still run. ↫ Steam support article While existing installations will continue to work, they will no longer receive any Steam updates or support. Valve obviously advises the small sliver of users still using 32bit Windows &#8211; unbeknownst to them, I&#8217;m sure &#8211; to upgrade to a 64bit release. Upcoming versions of Steam will only work on 64bit systems.]]>

      <title>GNOME 49 released</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143369/gnome-49-released/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[GNOME 49 has been released, and it&#8217;s got a lot of nice updates, improvements, and fixes for everyone. GNOME 49 finally replaces the ageing Totem video player with Showtime, and Evince, GNOME&#8217;s document viewer, is replaced by the new Papers. Both of these new applications bring a modern GTK4 user interface to replace their older GTK3 counterparts. Papers supports a ton of both document-oriented as well as comic book formats, and has annotation features. We&#8217;ve already touched on the extensive accessibility improvements in GNOME Calendar, but other applications have been improved as well, such as Maps, Software, and Web. Software&#8217;s improvements focus on improving the application&#8217;s performance, especially when dealing with Flatpaks from Flathub, while Web, GNOME&#8217;s web browser, comes with improved ad blocking and optional regional blocklists, better bookmark management, improved security features, and more. The remote desktop experience also saw a lot of work, with multitouch input support, extended virtual monitors, and relative mouse input. For developers, GNOME 49 comes with the new GTK 4.20, the latest version of Glib, and Libadwaita 1.8, released only a few days ago. It brings a brand new shortcuts information dialog as its most user-facing feature, on top of a whole bunch of other, developer-oriented features. GNOME 49 will find its way to your distribution of choice soon enough.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s 2025, and yes, you can still install and run a modern Linux distribution like Debian through a real hardware terminal. While I have used a terminal with the Pi, I’ve never before used it as a serial&#160;console&#160;all the way from early boot, and I have never installed Debian using the terminal to run the installer. A serial terminal gives you a login prompt. A serial console gives you access to kernel messages, the initrd environment, and sometimes even the bootloader. This might be fun, I thought. ↫ John Goerzen at The Changelog It seems Debian does a lot of the correct configurations for you, but there&#8217;s still a few things you&#8217;ll need to manually change, but none of it seems particularly complicated. Once the installation is completed, you have a system that&#8217;s completely accessible and usable from a hardware terminal, which, while maybe not particularly important in this day and age of effortless terminal emulators, is still quite a cool thing to have.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143365/haiku-vastly-improves-git-status-performance/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Another month, another summary of changes in Haiku, the BeOS-inspired operating system. The main focus this past month has been improving the performance of git status, which has been measurably worse on Haiku than on Linux running on similar hardware. This work has certainly paid off, as the numbers demonstrate. The results are clearly more than worth the trouble, though: in one test setup with&#160;git status&#160;in Haiku’s&#160;buildtools&#160;repository (which contains the entirety of the&#160;gcc&#160;and&#160;binutils&#160;source code, among other things – over 160,000 files) went from around 33 seconds with a cold disk cache, to around 20 seconds; and with a hot disk cache, from around 15 seconds to around 2.5 seconds. This is still a ways off from Linux (with a similar setup in the same repository,&#160;git status&#160;there with a hot disk cache takes only 0.3 seconds). Performance on Haiku will likely be measurably faster on builds without&#160;KDEBUG&#160;enabled, but not by that much. Still, this is clearly a significant improvement over the way things were before now. ↫ Haiku Activity &#38; Contract Report, August 2025 There&#8217;s more than this, of course, such as initial support for Intel&#8217;s Apollo Lake GPU in the Intel modesetting driver, improvements to USB disk performance, a reduction in power usage when in KDL, and much, much more.]]>

      <title>Why is the name of the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 hard-coded into the Bluetooth drivers?</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Some time ago, people noticed that buried in the Windows Bluetooth drivers is the hard-coded name of the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000. What’s going on there? Does the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 receive favorable treatment from the Microsoft Bluetooth drivers? Is this some sort of collusion? No, it’s not that. ↫ Raymond Chen So, what is the actual problem? It&#8217;s a funny one: an encoding mistake. The device local name string for a device needs to be encoded in UTF-8, and that&#8217;s where the developers of the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000 made a mistake. The string contains a registered trademark symbol &#8211; ® &#8211; but they encoded it in code page 1252, which not only isn&#8217;t allowed, but gets rejected completely. So, Windows&#8217; Bluetooth drivers have a table that contains the wrong name for a driver, accompanied by the right name to use. This mouse is the only entry.]]>

      <title>A months of ad-free OSNews: we’re closing in on the fundraising goal, and need your help to get there</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It&#8217;s been a little over a month since OSNews went completely ad-free for everyone. I can say the support has been overwhelming, with the accompanying fundraiser currently sitting at 67% of the €5000 goal! Of course things slowed down a bit after the initial week of one donation after the next, so I&#8217;m throwing out this reminder that without your support, OSNews can&#8217;t exist &#8211; doubly so now that I&#8217;ve removed any and all advertising. Help us reach that 100%! So, what can you do to support OSNews? By being entirely free from the corrupting influence of advertising, I have even less desire to chase views, entrap users with slop content, game search engines with shitty SEO spam, or turn on the taps of &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated trash to spew forth as much &#8220;articles&#8221; and thus views as possible. This also means that OSNews is one of the few technology news websites remaining that is not part of a massive corporate media conglomerate, so there&#8217;s no pressure from &#8220;corporate&#8221; to go easy on advertisers or write favourable stuff about corporate&#8217;s friends. You&#8217;d be surprised to learn how many technology sites out there are not independent. The response to OSNews no longer having any advertising has been overwhelmingly positive &#8211; unsurprisingly &#8211; and that has taken away any reservations I might have had about taking this step. In a world where so many websites are disappearing, turning into corporate mouthpieces, or becoming glorified content farms, OSNews can keep on doing what it does, independent of any outside influence, thanks to the countless contributions from all of you. Thank you.]]>

      <title>Writing an operating system kernel from scratch in Zig</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143343/writing-an-operating-system-kernel-from-scratch-in-zig/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[I recently implemented a minimal proof of concept time-sharing operating system kernel on RISC-V. In this post, I’ll share the details of how this prototype works. The target audience is anyone looking to understand low-level system software, drivers, system calls, etc., and I hope this will be especially useful to students of system software and computer architecture.  Finally, to do things differently here, I implemented this exercise in Zig, rather than traditional C. In addition to being an interesting experiment, I believe Zig makes this experiment much more easily reproducible on your machine, as it’s very easy to set up and does not require any installation (which could otherwise be slightly messy when cross-compiling to RISC-V). ↫ Uros Popovic This is not the first, and certainly not the last, operating system implemented from scratch as a teaching exercise, both for the creator itself, as well as for others wanting to follow along. This time it&#8217;s developed for RISC-V, and in an interesting twist, programmed in Zig (no Rust for once!).]]>

        <![CDATA[And the beatings continue until &#8220;AI&#8221; improves. Except if you live in the European Union/EEA, that is. Windows devices with the Microsoft 365 desktop client apps will automatically install the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. This app installation takes place in the background and would not disrupt the user. This app installation will start in Fall 2025. ↫ Microsoft support document Basically, if you have Microsoft 365 desktop applications installed &#8211; read my article about some deep Microsoft lore to figure out what that means &#8211; Microsoft is going to force-install all the Copilot stuff onto your computer, whether you like it or not. Thanks to more robust consumer protection legislation in the European Union/EEA, like the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, this force-install will not take place there. Administrators managing Office 365 deployments get an option to opt-out through the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center, but I&#8217;m not sure if regular users can use this method as well. Remember, when you&#8217;re using Windows (or macOS, for that matter), you don&#8217;t own your computer. Plan accordingly.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143337/the-idea-of-usr-sbin-has-failed-in-practice/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It may be arcane knowledge to most users of UNIX-like systems today, but there is supposed to be a difference between /usr/bin and /usr/sbin; the latter is supposed to be for &#8220;system binaries&#8221;, not needed by most normal users. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard states that sbin directories are intended to contain &#8220;utilities used for system administration (and other root-only commands)&#8221;, which is quite vague when you think about it. This has led to UNIX-like systems basically just winging it, making the distinction almost entirely arbitrary. For a long time, there has been no strong organizing principle to /usr/sbin that would draw a hard line and create a situation where people could safely leave it out of their $PATH. We could have had a principle of, for example, &#8220;programs that don&#8217;t work unless run by root&#8221;, but no such principle was ever followed for very long (if at all). Instead programs were more or less shoved in /usr/sbin if developers thought they were relatively unlikely to be used by normal people. But &#8216;relatively unlikely&#8217; is not &#8216;never&#8217;, and shortly after people got told to &#8216;run traceroute&#8217; and got &#8216;command not found&#8217; when they tried, /usr/sbin (probably) started appearing in $PATH. ↫ Chris Siebenmann As such, Fedora 42 unifies /usr/bin and /usr/sbin, which is kind of a follow-up to the /usr merge, and serves as a further simplification and clean-up of the file system layout by removing divisions and directories that used to make sense, but no longer really do. Decisions like these have a tendency to upset a small but very vocal group of people, people who often do not even use the distribution implementing the decisions in question in the first place. My suggestions to those people would be to stick to distributions that more closely resemble classic UNIX. Or use a real UNIX. Anyway, these are good moves, and I&#8217;m glad most prominent Linux distributions are not married to decisions made in the &#8217;70s, especially not when they can be undone without users really noticing anything.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Google continues putting nails in the coffin that is the Android Open Source Project. This time, they&#8217;re changing the way they handle security updates to appease slow, irresponsible Android OEMs, while screwing over everyone else. The basic gist is that instead of providing monthly security updates for OEMs to implement on their Android devices, Google will now move to a quarterly model, publishing only extremely severe issues on a monthly basis. The benefit for OEMs is that for most vulnerabilities, they get three months to distribute (most) fixes instead of just one month, but the downsides are also legion. Vulnerabilities will now be out in the wild for three months instead of just one, and while they&#8217;re shared with OEMs &#8220;privately&#8221;, we&#8217;re talking tends of thousands of pairs of eyes here, so &#8220;privately&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer. The dangers are obvious; these vulnerabilities will be leaked, and they will be abused by malicious parties. Another massive downside related to this change is that Google will now no longer be providing the monthly patches as open source within AOSP, instead only releasing the quarterly patch drops as open source. This means exactly what you think it does: no more monthly security updates from third-party ROMs, unless those third-party ROMs choose to violate the embargo themselves and thus invite all sorts of problems. Extending the patch access window from one month to three is absolutely insane. Google should be striving to shorten this window as much as possible, but instead, they&#8217;re tripling it in length to create a false sense of security. OEMs can now point at their quarterly security updates and claim to be patching vulnerabilities as soon as Google publishes them, while in fact, the unpatched vulnerabilities will have been out in the wild for months by that point. This change is irresponsible, misguided, and done only to please lazy, shitty OEMs to create a false sense of security for marketing purposes.]]>

      <title>China is selling its Great Firewall censorship tools to countries around the world</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143333/china-is-selling-its-great-firewall-censorship-tools-to-countries-around-the-world/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We&#8217;re all aware of the Chinese Great Firewall, the tool the Chinese government uses for mass censorship and for safeguarding and strengthening its totalitarian control over the country and its population. It turns out that through a Chinese shell company called Geedge Networks, China is also selling the Great Firewall to other totalitarian regimes around the world. Thanks to a massive leak of 500 GB of source code, work logs, and internal communication records, we now have more insight into how the Great Firewall works than ever before, leading to in-depth reports like this one from InterSecLab. The findings are chilling, but not surprising. First and foremost, Geedge is selling the Great Firewall to a variety of totalitarian regimes around the world, namely Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Myanmar, and another unidentified country. These governments can then ask Geedge to make specific changes and ask them to focus on specific capabilities to further enhance the functionality of the Great Firewall, but what it can already do today is bad enough. The suite of products offered by Geedge Networks allow a client government unprecedented access to internet user data and enables governments to use this data to police national and regional networks. These capabilities include deep packet inspection for advanced classification, interception, and manipulation of application and user traffic; monitoring the geographic location of mobile subscribers in real time; analyzing aggregated network traffic in specific areas, such as during a protest or event; flagging unusual traffic patterns as suspicious; creating tailored blocking rules to obstruct access to a website or application (such as a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or circumvention tool); throttling traffic to specific services; identifying individual internet users for accessing websites or using circumvention tools or VPNs; assigning individual internet users reputation scores based on their online activities; and infecting users with malware through in-path injection. ↫ The Internet Coup: A Technical Analysis on How a Chinese Company is Exporting The Great Firewall to Autocratic Regimes Internet service providers participate in the implementation of the suite of tools, either freely or by force, and since the tools are platform-agnostic it doesn&#8217;t matter which platforms people are using in any given country, making international sanctions effectively useless. It also won&#8217;t surprise you that Geedge steals both proprietary and open source code, without regards for licensing terms. Furthermore, China is allowing provinces and regions within its borders to tailor and adapt the Great Firewall to their own local needs, providing a blueprint for how to export the suite of tools to other countries. With quite a few countries sliding ever further towards authoritarianism, I&#8217;m sure even places not traditionally thought of as totalitarian are lustfully looking at the Chinese Great Firewall, wishing they had something similar in their own countries.]]>

        <![CDATA[More than three years in the making, with a concerted effort starting last year, my CPU-time profiler landed in Java with OpenJDK 25. It’s an experimental new profiler/method sampler that helps you find performance issues in your code, having distinct advantages over the current sampler. This is what this week’s and next week’s blog posts are all about. This week, I will cover why we need a new profiler and what information it provides; next week, I’ll cover the technical internals that go beyond what’s written in the JEP. I will quote the JEP 509 quite a lot, thanks to Ron Pressler; it reads like a well-written blog post in and of itself. ↫ Johannes Bechberger There&#8217;s also a third entry detailing queue sizing, and a fourth entry going into the removal of redundant synchronisation.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143326/utf-8-is-a-brilliant-design/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.  Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design. ↫ Vishnu Haridas On a slightly related note, if you are ever bothered or annoyed by text online rendering as unknown squares, you most likely are just missing the proper fonts to render them. At least on most Linux and BSD systems, all you need to do is install the entire set of Noto fonts, including those for every single non-Latin script. Assuming your package manager has sane naming conventions, it&#8217;ll most likely come down to something like sudo dnf install google-noto* or whatever your system&#8217;s install package command is, and after installing a whole slew of font files, your system will now be able to render virtually every script under the sun. After installing this massive font set, you can do things like write and render in hieroglyphics, write Ea-nāṣir&#8216;s name the way it&#8217;s supposed to, and render all kinds of other scripts and symbols without ever having to look at one of those blank squares ever again.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[I&#8217;m not really into the niche of &#8220;virtual YouTubers&#8221; &#8211; people who post YouTube videos and/or stream using a virtual avatar &#8211; but to each their own, and if this technology enables people to remain anonymous while doing what they love on YouTube or Twitch, I&#8217;m all for it. Since these virtual avatars also do things like face-tracking, there&#8217;s a whole cottage industry of software tools to make this all work, but Adrian &#8220;asie&#8221; Siekierka decided to take a look at where the training data used to make such face-tracking work actually comes from. One day, some years ago, I decided to look at the data used to train OpenSeeFace. OpenSeeFace is the most popular open source face tracking solution for virtual YouTubers. It is supported by both open source and commercial model rendering tools; in particular, VTube Studio allows using it as an option for webcam tracking. ↫ Adrian &#8220;asie&#8221; Siekierka The results of the investigation are not exactly great. Much of the data used by OpenSeeFace comes with serious restrictions on commercial use, and many of the underlying datasets contain images that you would need consent for from the people inside the image to actually use. On top of that, a lot of these data sets seem to have just scraped the internet for images of faces without asking anyone of the people in those images for consent, which raises a whole number of troubling issues. I find this a very interesting topic of discussion, if only because you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to argue that the average cartoon-esque virtual avatars even remotely resemble real human faces, so it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going to suddenly run into your own face somewhere on YouTube or Twitch, but plastered into another person. On the other hand, the underlying datasets still contain a ton of people&#8217;s faces without those people&#8217;s consent, and even for those that did give consent, there&#8217;s often a commercial use restriction which earning revenue on YouTube or Twitch might violate. It&#8217;s a fascinating microcosm of a whole slew of issues we&#8217;re dealing with right now, neatly contained in a relatively small niche.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Who doesn&#8217;t love a desktop-oriented hobby operating system to start off the weekend? SkiftOS is a hobbyist operating system built from the ground up with a focus on modularity, simplicity, and modern design principles. Driven by a dissatisfaction with the fragmented user experiences prevalent in contemporary operating systems, SkiftOS strives for deep integration and a cohesive aesthetic. This project is a labor of love—an artistic pursuit rather than a commercial product. ↫ SkiftOS gitHub page Reading through the GitHub page and SkiftOS&#8217; actual website, it reminds me so, so much of the desktop-oriented hobby operating systems of the early 2000s, like AtheOS, SkyOS, and others. It has its own microkernel, C++ core library, package manager, reactive UI framework, an entire desktop environment, and even a browser engine. This operating system is remarkably complete in the features that it already offers, especially considering its hobby status. The desktop environment is called Hideo, and it&#8217;s remarkably beautiful when you consider we&#8217;re talking about a hobby operating system. It comes with a variety of applications, too, mostly covering the basics we&#8217;ve come to expect from a desktop operating system, like a text editor, archive manager, task manager, image viewer, media player, a file manager, and so on. Meanwhile, the browser engine is called Vaev and is highly experimental, but its existence illustrates just how broad this project really is. I haven&#8217;t been able to find some time to run it yet, but if you&#8217;re interested, they advise you to run it using qemu. While running it on real hardware is technically possible, it&#8217;s not advisable due to the alpha state of the operating system.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[One of the most annoying things I encountered while trying out Windows 11 a few months ago was the utterly broken dark mode; broken since its inception nine years ago, but finally getting some fixes. One of the smaller but downright disturbing issues with dark mode on Windows 11 is that when Explorer is in dark mode, it will flash bright white whenever you open a new window or a new tab. It&#8217;s like the operating system is throwing flashbangs at you every time you need to do some file management. Luckily, it turns out there&#8217;s a fix, as Neowin details. Windows 11 is turning four in a couple of months, but Microsoft still has not fixed this annoying and, for some people, legitimately life-threatening bug (there is a reason why we have seizure warnings in games, movies, etc). As such, users have to take things into their hands and come up with custom solutions. One such solution is a simple Windhawk mod that fixes what a nearly four-trillion-dollar company still won&#8217;t figure out. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin This made me check out Windhawk, and it seems like an awesome project for people forced to use Windows. It is basically a package manager for various small mods, fixes, and changes for Windows, allowing you to mix and match exactly what you need. This way, you can easily fix the little niggles that bother you, all from a central location. The list of available mods is quite long already, and browsing through it, I&#8217;ve already seen quite a few things I&#8217;d be applying in a heartbeat if I were to be using Windows. Every mod comes with its source code included, ensuring you can check that it does exactly what it says it will do, and of course, you can contribute your own mods as well.]]>

      <title>Apple’s assault on standards</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143313/apples-assault-on-standards/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We often focus on Google&#8217;s detrimental effects on the web, but in doing so, we often tend to forget the other major player who is quite possibly even more damaging to the web than Google can even dream to be. Without a counterweight, network effects allow successful tech firms to concentrate wealth and political influence. This power allows them to degrade potential competitive challenges, enabling rent extraction for services that would otherwise be commodities. This mechanism operates through (often legalised) corruption of judicial, regulatory, and electoral systems. When left to fester, it corrodes democracy itself. Apple has deftly used a false cloak of security and privacy to move the internet, and web in particular, toward enclosure and irrelevance. This post makes the case for why Apple should be considered a corrupted, and indeed incompetent, autocrat in our digital lives. It continues to abusing a unique form of monopoly to extract rents, including on the last remnants of open ecosystems it tolerates. Worse, Apple&#8217;s centralisation through the App Store&#160;entrenches the positions of peer big tech firms, harming the prospects of competitors in turn.&#160;Apple have been, over the course of many years, poisonous to internet standards and the moral commitments of that grand project. ↫ Alex Russell at Infrequently Noted I have nothing more to add.]]>

      <title>Windows/386’s check for buggy 386 chips survived until Windows 8.1</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143311/windows-386s-check-for-buggy-386-chips-survived-until-windows-8-1/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A version of Windows that&#8217;s often overlooked, and often probably entirely unknown, is Windows/386. When Microsoft released 2.x, they did so in two very different variants: Windows/286 and Windows/386. The former would run on anything from a 8088 and up, but wouldn&#8217;t make use of any of the new features of the 386, while the latter, as its name implies, was optimised for the 386 and introduced a ton of advanced features to the platform. Windows/386 laid the groundwork for the much more successful Windows 3.x and 9x, but weirdly enough, it&#8217;s never really been studied all that well to understand how it works and what it&#8217;s doing under the hood. That has changed now, as Will &#8220;CaptainWillStarblazer&#8221; Klees, whom we already know for his amazing work to allow RISC Win32 applications to run on x86, has delved deep into Widnows/386 with a ton of reverse-engineering to uncover many of its secrets. There&#8217;s so many amazing findings in here, I honestly have no idea where to even start or what to highlight, so I&#8217;m picking two things that I think are quite entertaining. First, Windows/386 does a number of checks to determine if your PC can run it, and one of the checks it does concerns &#8220;defending against early buggy 386 steppings&#8221;. It turns out that this exact check for buggy steppings in early 386 processors survived in Windows all the way up until Windows 8.1, which is wild to think about. A second fascinating finding is that a crucial component of Windows/386 finds its origins in an unusual place: Xenix, Microsoft&#8217;s UNIX implementation. Finally, it begins loading the Virtual DOS Machine Manager (VDMM) into memory from the file WIN386.386. This file is not an OS/2 Linear Executable like the 386 files from later versions of Windows (that format did not yet exist), rather it is the 32-bit x.out executable format from Xenix-386 (thank you, Michal Necasek!), which makes sense as it was the only 32-bit executable format that Microsoft would have a linker for at the time (and interoperated well with Microsoft’s OMF-based tools, such as MASM). ↫ Will &#8220;CaptainWillStarblazer&#8221; Klees at Virtually Fun There&#8217;s a fun detail about the 386 version of Xenix: it was ported to the 386 by a company we all came to hate deeply: SCO. The technology world is far smaller than we often seem to think. Apparently Xenix for the 386 was the first fully 32bit operating system for the x86 architecture, illustrating that once, a long, long time ago, SCO was an actually capable, innovative company. The work by Klees and his extremely detailed write-up are a joy to read, so head on over and have some fun.]]>

      <title>Deluxe Paint on the Commodore Amiga</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[VisiCalc on the Apple II. Lotus 1-2-3 on the IBM PC. Aldus PageMaker on the Macintosh. Deluxe Paint on the Amiga. The computer industry loves a “killer app,” that unique piece of software that compels consumers to purchase new computer hardware just for the privilege of running it. I can personally attest to Deluxe Paint as it compelled even my technophobic mother to buy into its potential. ↫ Christopher Drum Even though I knew what Deluxe Paint for the Amiga was, I never really delved any deeper into what, exactly, it was capable of. Drum does a great job setting up an emulated Amiga environment to go back in time to his childhood, and see what it&#8217;s like to use Deluxe Paint today, in 2025. It turns out it can do things I never thought it could, like create 3D perspective effects, with optional antialiasing even (even though the latter takes multiple minutes to render). In fact, it even has tools to create animations, allowing you to brush across different frames automatically, or even create movement paths in a 3D space by defining start and endpoints for a brush movement. Combine all of these tools, and you can create things like animated doors opening and closing with a clear 3D effect. It&#8217;s quite neat. It&#8217;s no secret the Amiga was far ahead of its time, but it&#8217;s still awe-inspiring to see it in action like this.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143305/kde-plasma-6-on-freebsd-using-wayland/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This year, 2025, the KDE Community held its yearly conference in Berlin, Germany. On the way I reinstalled FreeBSD on my Frame.work 13 laptop in another attempt to get KDE Plasma 6 Wayland working. Short story: yes, KDE Plasma 6 Wayland on FreeBSD works. ↫ Adriaan de Groot Adriaan de Groot is a long-time KDE developer and FreeBSD package maintainer, and he&#8217;s published a short but detailed guide on setting up a KDE Plasma desktop on FreeBSD using Wayland instead of X11. With the Linux world slowly but finally leaving X11 behind, the BSD world really has little choice but to follow, especially if they want to continue offering the two major desktop environments. Most of KDE and GNOME are focused on Linux, and the BSDs have always kind of tagged along for the ride, and over the coming years that&#8217;s going to mean they&#8217;ll have to invest more in making Wayland run comfortably on BSD. Of course, the other option would be the KDE and GNOME experience on the BSDs slowly degrading over time, but I think especially FreeBSD is keen to avoid that fate, while OpenBSD and NetBSD seem a bit more hands-off in the desktop space. FreeBSD is investing heavily in its usability as a desktop operating system, and that&#8217;s simply going to mean getting Wayland support up to snuff. Not only will KDE and GNOME slowly depend more and more on Wayland, Xorg itself will also become less maintained than it already is. Sometimes, the current just takes you where it&#8217;s going.]]>

There&#8217;s countless tools to make this process a little bit easier, and one of them, Flyoobe, just got a major update to aid in removing all the &#8220;AI&#8221; nonsense Microsoft is forcing down the throats of its users. Starting off with version 1.7, people who hate the way Microsoft has been stuffing AI features into Windows 11 will be pleased to know that there is an OOBE view that allows you to discover and disable all AI and Copilot features after the installation of the OS. Moreover, the OOBE view that handles bloat removal has been enhanced too, and now allows presets ranging from Minimal to Full, along with the ability to load custom presets from GitHub. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin If Microsoft actually cared about the users of its Windows operating system, they would simply include an advanced options view during installation, in which you could customise your installation. Instead, users have to rely on what are essentially hacks to get to a point where their operating system installation can serve their needs, which is batshit insane to me. I&#8217;m glad projects like Flyoobe exists, but they shouldn&#8217;t have to.]]>

      <title>Nova Launcher’s open source release blocked by its owners, despite contractual obligations</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143297/nova-launchers-open-source-release-blocked-by-its-owners-despite-contractual-obligations/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Three years ago, the incredibly popular Android launcher Nova Launcher was acquired by Branch, a mobile links and analytics company. Understandably, people were worried this would spell the end of the launcher, as it would certainly become a vessel for tracking and mobile advertising. Weirdly enough, this never actually happened &#8211; instead, Nova just kind of fizzled out. First, virtually the entire Nova team was laid off two years after the acquisition, save for Nova&#8217;s original founder, Kevin Barry, who was not let go. Development had come to a halt already at that point, and ever since, it&#8217;s been quiet. Until this weekend. Barry posted on his blog that he left Branch, and thus is no longer working on Nova Launcher. You&#8217;d think this would be the final nail in the coffin for this once rather ubiquitous launcher, but that&#8217;s actually not the case, as Barry explains. For the past several months I have been preparing the Open Source release of Nova Launcher. This work included cleaning up the codebase, reviewing licenses, removing or replacing proprietary code, and coordinating with legal to ensure a proper release. When Branch acquired Nova in 2022, Branch then-CEO and founder Alex Austin made several public commitments to the community about Nova&#8217;s future, including statements about open sourcing:  However I was ultimately asked to stop working on Nova Launcher and the open sourcing effort. ↫ Kevin Barry Basically, one of the reasons Barry felt comfortable selling Nova to Branch was a contractual agreement &#8211; backed up by public statements from then-CEO of Branch, Alex Austin &#8211; that if Barry were to leave Branch, he would be allowed to release Nova as open source. It seems that this promise is not being honoured by the new CEO, for unclear reasons, leaving what was arguably one of the best launchers for Android in limbo. Nobody&#8217;s working on it anymore, and a contractual agreement is not being honoured, for whatever reason. One of the people who used to work on Nova but was part of that first round of layoffs, Cliff Wade, is now trying to raise awareness of this stalemate. He&#8217;s trying to talk to former colleagues at Branch, and trying to put some pressure on Branch to honour their contractual obligations and public promises. I&#8217;m fully behind this effort, because up until the institutional neglect set in, Nova was one of the very best Android applications, clearly made by people who truly understood what Android enthusiasts wanted out of a highly configurable launcher. Branch needs to honour its word, and allow Barry to continue preparing the release of Nova as open source. Head on over to Branch&#8217;s contact page, and let them know they need to release Nova as open source &#8211; in a polite, constructive manner, of course. The people working at Branch are just ordinary folk like you and I, and I will not stand for anyone being aggressive, insulting, or otherwise committing harassment towards Branch and its employees.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143294/kde-releases-first-alpha-of-kde-linux/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Akademy 2025, KDE&#8217;s yearly developer and community event, this year held in Berlin, Germany. Amid all the various talks and informal meetings, the KDE project also officially unveiled the first alpha release of KDE Linux, a project they&#8217;ve been working on for a while now. KDE Linux will serve as a &#8220;reference implementation&#8221; of KDE Plasma and official KDE applications, for use by developers and regular users alike. KDE Linux will have a quick update cycle, to ensure its users always have the latest releases of KDE Plasma and various other KDE applications and related technologies. It may, however, not be as optimised as other KDE distributions, and the intent of KDE Linux is not to compete with or replace other distributions. The goal is to show other distributions how KDE itself intends for its software to be presented. So, what is KDE Linux based on? KDE Linux is an “immutable base OS” Linux distro with a core created using Arch Linux packages — but it should not be considered part of the Arch family of distributions. Some very fundamental Arch technologies (like the pacman package manager!) have been removed. KDE software is then built on top of this core using KDE&#8217;s homegrown development tools and Flatpak. KDE Linux leans on Systemd for a great deal of functionality. Updates are atomic and image-based, with the last 5 OS images cached on disk for safety. Only the Wayland session is supported. Apps primarily come from Flatpak and Snap. ↫ KDE Linux&#8217; website The overview of the KDE Linux&#8217; architecture provides some more details. I like that it eschews GRUB in favour of systemd-boot (GRUB should be retired in this, the year of our lord 2025) and relies on systemd-sysupdate for operating system updates. Of note is that the mention of Snap is merely for convenience&#8217;s sake as an option; Snap is not a requirement, nor are any Snap packages installed by default. Since this is the first alpha release, expect bugs and issues, and don&#8217;t use it on any production machines until they&#8217;re a few more releases in.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The European Commission today fined Google €2.95 billion for abusing its dominant position in the advertising technology market, despite the threat of trade retribution from U.S President Donald Trump. The American tech giant is alleged to have distorted the market for online ads by favoring its own services to the detriment of competitors, advertisers and online publishers, the EU executive said in a press release. ↫ Jacob Parry at Politico Not only does Google have to pay a pretty hefty fine &#8211; for corporate standards, as it&#8217;s still peanuts when looking at Google&#8217;s revenue, because class justice is real &#8211; the company also has to submit a plan within 60 days detailing how it&#8217;s going to end the illegal behaviour. Of course, Google is going to contest the fine, but the company is also running to daddy to cry and whine about how those damn Europeans won&#8217;t let it engage in illegal behaviour. Last night, all the big US technology CEOs gathered for a dinner with Donald Trump, each taking turns gratuitously thanking and praising the big man for his amazing achievements during these first few months of his administration. Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, and many more were all bending the knee and kissing the ring in what can only be described as a borderline pornographic display of fealty. Among them was, of course, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, one day after Google laughed its way out of the courtroom. “Well you had a very good day yesterday,” Trump said, calling on Pichai at the Thursday evening dinner. “Google had a very good day yesterday. Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?”  “I’m glad it’s over,” Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests. “It’s a long process,” Pichai said. “Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution.” ↫ Jennifer Elias at CNBC Mind you, several of those &#8220;other table guests&#8221; are also being investigated by a variety of arms of the US government for monopoly abuse and antritrust violations, and I&#8217;m sure their laughter was almost entirely self-serving. If Google of all monopolies can slime its way out of any serious consequences, what hope does that leave that the other tech giants will ever have to face the consequences of their abuse? At least the European Union seems to be mostly holding its head high so far, but one can&#8217;t help but wonder how long the Phoenician princess can hold off the bull. The fact of the matter is that the European and US economies are heavily intertwined, and we let ourselves become utterly dependent on the US for our defense, too, and with Trump not deterred by Pyrrhic victories, a fallout is definitely not out of the question.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[We&#8217;re all being told that &#8220;AI&#8221; is revolutionizing programming. Whether the marketing is coming from Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Google, or the countless other players in this area, it&#8217;s all emphasizing the massive productivity and speed gains programmers who use &#8220;AI&#8221; tools will achieve. The relentless marketing is clearly influencing both managers and programmers alike, with the former forcing &#8220;AI&#8221; down their subordinates&#8217; throats, and the latter claiming to see absolutely bizarre productivity gains. The impact of the marketing is real &#8211; people are being fired, programmers are expected to be ridiculously more productive without commensurate pay raises, and anyone questioning this new corporate gospel will probably end up on the chopping block next. It&#8217;s like the industry has become a nunnery, and all the nuns are meowing like cats. The reality seems to be, though, that none of these &#8220;AI&#8221; programming tools are making anyone more productive. Up until recently, Mike Judge truly believed &#8220;AI&#8221; was making him a much more productive programmer &#8211; until he ran the numbers of his own work, and realised that he was not one bit more productive at all, and his point is that if the marketing is true, and programmers are indeed becoming vastly more productive, where&#8217;s the evidence? And yet, despite the most widespread adoption one could imagine, these tools don’t work. My argument: If so many developers are so extraordinarily productive using these tools, where is the flood of shovelware? We should be seeing apps of all shapes and sizes, video games, new websites, mobile apps, software-as-a-service apps — we should be drowning in choice. We should be in the middle of an indie software revolution. We should be seeing 10,000 Tetris clones on Steam. ↫ Mike Judge He proceeded to collect tons of data about new software releases on the iOS App Store, the Play Store, Steam, GitHub, and so on, as well as the number of domain registrations, and the numbers paint a very different picture from the exuberant marketing. Every single metric is flat. There&#8217;s no spike in new games, new applications, new repositories, new domain registrations. It&#8217;s all proceeding as if &#8220;AI&#8221; had had zero effect on productivity. This whole thing is bullshit. So if you&#8217;re a developer feeling pressured to adopt these tools — by your manager, your peers, or the general industry hysteria — trust your gut. If these tools feel clunky, if they&#8217;re slowing you down, if you&#8217;re confused how other people can be so productive, you&#8217;re not broken. The data backs up what you&#8217;re experiencing. You&#8217;re not falling behind by sticking with what you know works. If you’re feeling brave, show your manager these charts and ask them what they think about it. If you take away anything from this it should be that (A) developers aren&#8217;t shipping anything more than they were before (that’s the only metric that matters), and (B) if someone — whether it&#8217;s your CEO, your tech lead, or some Reddit dork — claims they&#8217;re now a 10xer because of AI, that’s almost assuredly untrue, demand they show receipts or shut the fuck up. ↫ Mike Judge Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the evidence just isn&#8217;t there. The corporate world has an endless list of productivity metrics &#8211; some more reliable than others &#8211; and I have the sneaking suspicion we&#8217;re only fed marketing instead of facts because none of those metrics are showing any impact of &#8220;AI&#8221; whatsoever, because if they did, we know the &#8220;AI&#8221; pushers wouldn&#8217;t shut the fuck up about it. Show me more than meowing nuns, and I&#8217;ll believe the hype is real.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[I recently removed all advertising from OSNews, and one of the reasons to do so is that online ads have become a serious avenue for malware and other security problems. Advertising on the web has become such a massive security risk that even the very birthplace of the world wide web, CERN, now strongly advises its staff to use adblockers. If you value your privacy and, also important, if you value the security of your computer, consider installing an ad blocker. While there is a plethora of them out there, the Computer Security Office’s members use, e.g. uBlock origin (Firefox) or Origin Lite (Chrome), AdblockPlus, Ghostery and Privacy Badger of the US-based Electronic Frontier Foundation. They all come in free (as in “free beer”) versions for all major browsers and also offer more sophisticated features if you are willing to pay. Once enabled, and depending on your desired level of protection, they can provide another thorough layer of protection to your device – and subsequently to CERN. ↫ CERN&#8217;s Computer Security Office I think it&#8217;s high time lawmakers take a long, hard look at the state of online advertising, and consider taking strong measures like banning online tracking and targeted advertising. Even the above-board online advertising industry is built atop dubious practices and borderline criminal behaviour, and things only get worse from there. Malicious actors even manage to infiltrate Google&#8217;s own search engine with dangerous ads, and that&#8217;s absolutely insane when you think about it. I&#8217;ve reached the point where I consider any website with advertising to be disrespectful and putting its visitors at risk, willingly and knowingly. Adblockers are not just a nice-to-have, but an absolute necessity for a pleasant and safe browsing experience, and that should be an indicator that we need to really stop and think what we&#8217;re doing here.]]>

      <title>The GNU Guix System’s lack of manpower problems</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143277/the-gnu-guix-systems-lack-of-manpower-problems/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[As if Francesco P. Lovergine heard my prayers, he wrote an article detailing his experiences with using Guix. Considering he&#8217;s a longtime Debian developer, we&#8217;re looking at someone who knows a thing or two about Linux. In the last few months, I have installed and upgraded my second preferred GNU/Linux system, GNU Guix, on multiple boxes. Regarding that system, I have already written a few introductory posts in the recent past. This is an update about my experiences as a user and developer. I still think Guix is a giant step forward in packaging and management, in comparison with Debian and other distributions, for elegance and inner coherence. ↫ Francesco P. Lovergine Lovergine found some problems with Guix, most notably those stemming from a lack of manpower. It&#8217;s not a hugely popular package management system and associated distribution, so the team of developers behind it is relatively small, and this leads to issues like outdated packages, problems arising from updates, and possible security issues. There&#8217;s no specific security team, for instance, but at least it&#8217;s easy to roll back updates due to the nature of Guix. Another problem, partially related to the lack of manpower, stems from the fact that the GNU Guix System uses some unusual systems, most notably GNU Shepard. This init system is an alternative to the widely-used systemd, alongside other alternatives like runit (which I use through Void Linux), but due to its relative lack of popularity, it can take some time for more complex packages to be made compatible with it. Especially some packages &#8211; like GNOME &#8211; that depend more and more on systemd are going to lag behind on Guix. For anyone with decent Linux experience and a willingness to tinker, I don&#8217;t think any of these issues &#8211; and the others Lovergine mentions &#8211; are dealbreakers. Sure, you might not want to deploy the GNU Guix System on a production system or anything that requires solid, strong security, but for personal and enthusiast use it seems like an interesting and somewhat unorthodox Linux distribution.]]>

      <title>Towards Rust in Windows drivers</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143263/towards-rust-in-windows-drivers/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Microsoft has been working on allowing driver developers to write Windows drivers in Rust, and the company has published a progress report detailing this effort. In the windows-drivers-rs GitHub repository you&#8217;ll find a bunch of Rust crates for writing Windows drivers in Rust. Using these crates, driver developers can create valid WDM, KMDF, and UMDF driver binaries that load and run on a Windows 11 machine.  Drivers written in this manner still need to make use of unsafe blocks for interacting with the Windows operating system, but can take advantage of Rust’s rich type system as well as its safety guarantees for business logic implemented in safe Rust.  Though there is still significant work to be done on abstracting away these unsafe blocks (more on this below), these Rust drivers can load and run on Windows systems just like their C counterparts. ↫ Nate Deisinger at the Windows Driver Developer Blog As mentioned above, there&#8217;s still work to be done with reducing the amount of unsafe Rust code in these drivers, and Microsoft is working on just that. The company is developing safe Rust bindings and abstractions, as well as additional safe structs and APIs beyond the Windows Driver Framework, but due to the complexity of Windows drivers, this will take a while. Microsoft states that it believes memory-safe languages like Rust are the future of secure software development, but of course, in true Microsoft fashion, the company doesn&#8217;t want to alienate developers writing traditional drivers in C either.]]>

      <title>Why self-host 9front?</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143261/why-self-host-9front/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In 9front, we host almost all parts of our development process on 9front &#8212; the git repositories, the mailing list, the ci/cd, the web site, and everything else. (The exception is #cat-v IRC) We use the system regularly, both when hacking on the system and in our personal use. Personally, I write most of my code on Plan 9, read my emails there, and often drive Linux from there. I run my home network off of a 9front CPU server, and host my websites off it. I know other people around 9front do similar. ↫ Ori Bernstein It clearly shows, too. If you dive into the 9front community, you&#8217;ll quickly realise everything runs on 9front, and that does create a sense that the operating system is capable, and that its developers have confidence and pride in their work. Exploring 9front myself, it feels awesome to see that all the documentation I&#8217;m reading is being hosted on 9front machines. I&#8217;m going to relaunch the OSNews Gemini capsule, this time hosted on 9front, and since countless 9front users host their own Gemini capsules on 9front, I feel confident that I&#8217;ve got people to talk to when I need help. I just need the time to actually sit down and figure out the minutiae of 9front, because it truly is unique.]]>

      <title>Class justice: Google gets away with a gentle pat on the wrist for its illegal monopoly abuse</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143257/class-justice-google-gets-away-with-a-gentle-pat-on-the-wrist-for-its-illegal-monopoly-abuse/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A little over a year ago, DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google is a monopolist and violated US antitrust law. Today, Mehta ruled that while Google violated the law, there won&#8217;t be any punishment for the search giant. They don&#8217;t have to divest Chrome or Android, they can keep paying third parties to preload their services and products, and they can keep paying Apple €20 billion a year to be the default search engine on iOS. Mehta declined to grant some of the more ambitious proposals from the Justice Department to remedy Google’s behavior and restore competition to the market. Besides letting Google keep Chrome, he’ll also let the company continue to pay distribution partners for preloading or placement of its search or AI products. But he did order Google to share some valuable search information with rivals that could help jumpstart their ability to compete, and bar the search giant from making exclusive deals to distribute its search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Mehta granted Google a massive win here, further underlining that as long as you&#8217;re wealthy, a corporation, or better yet, both, you are free to break the law and engage in criminal behaviour. The only thing you&#8217;ll get is some mild negative press and a gentle pat on the wrist, and you can be on your merry way to continue your illegal behaviour. None of it is surprising, except perhaps for the brazenness of the class justice on display here. The events during and course of this antitrust case mirrors those of the antitrust case involving Microsoft, over 25 years ago. Microsoft, too, had a long, documented, and proven history of illegal behaviour, but like Google today, also got away with a similar gentle pat on the wrist. It&#8217;s likely that the antitrust cases currently running against Apple and Amazon will end in similar gentle pats on the wrist, further solidifying that you can break the law all you want, as long as you&#8217;re rich. Thank god the real criminal scum is behind bars.]]>

      <title>A gentle introduction to CP/M</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143248/a-gentle-introduction-to-cp-m/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For an operating system that was once incredibly popular and expected to become a standard for a long time to come, it&#8217;s remarkable how little experience most people have with CP/M. In fact, many conventions and historical limitations you might be aware of &#8211; like the 8.3 filename convention of DOS &#8211; come straight from CP/M, as it influenced DOS considerably. It&#8217;s quite easy to emulate CP/M today, but it&#8217;s just old and different enough that getting into it might be a but confusing, but that&#8217;s where Eerie Linux&#8217;s introduction to CP/M comes into play. This article is just what the headline promises: an introduction to the CP/M operating system. No previous knowledge of 1970s and early ’80s operating systems is required. However, some familiarity with Linux or a BSD-style operating system is assumed, as the setup process suggested here involves using a package manager and command-line tools. But why explore CP/M in the 2020s? There are (at least) two good reasons: 1) historical education 2) gaining a better understanding of how computers actually work. ↫ Eerie Linux This article is a great way to get up and running with CP/M fairly quickly, and I intend to do just that when I find some time to mess around with it. What are some of the core, crucial applications that one should try on CP/M? Things people would be using back when CP/M was properly in use?]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[My goal with this article is to share my perspectives on the web, as well as introduce many aspects of modern HTML/CSS you may not be familiar with. I’m not trying to make you give up JavaScript, I’m just trying to show you everything that’s possible, leaving it up to you to pick what works best for whatever you’re working on. I think there’s a lot most web developers don’t know about CSS. And I think JS is often used where better alternatives exist. So, let me show you what’s out there.  ↫ Lyra Rebane As someone who famously can&#8217;t program, the one thing I like about CSS is that I find it quite readable and generally easy to figure out how I can change things like colours, fonts, and so on. Of course, anything more complex will still break my brain, but even the more complex elements are still at least nominally readable, and it&#8217;s often quite easy to determine what a piece of CSS does, even if I don&#8217;t know how to manipulate it or how to get even close to any desired result. It&#8217;s like how the fact I learned Latin and French in high school makes it possible for me to nominally understand a text in Spanish, even if I have never spent a single second studying it. JavaScript, on the other hand, is just a black box, incomprehensible gibberish I can&#8217;t make heads or tails of, which in my mind goes against what the web is supposed to be about. The web is supposed to be an open platform in more ways than one, and the ability to make a website should not be hidden behind complex programming languages or website builder gatekeepers. The fact JavaScript is a resource hog and misused all over the place sure doesn&#8217;t help, either. If you want to know more about the current state of CSS, the linked article by Lyra Rebane is a great place to start. I wish I had the skills to finally give OSNews a full makeover, but alas, I don&#8217;t.]]>

      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143244/we-need-to-seriously-think-about-what-to-do-with-c-modules/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jussi Pakkanen, creator of the Meson build system, has some words about modules in C++. If C++ modules can not show a 5× compilation time speedup (preferably 10×) on multiple existing open source code base, modules should be killed and taken out of the standard. Without this speedup pouring any more resources into modules is just feeding the sunk cost fallacy. That seems like a harsh thing to say for such a massive undertaking that promises to make things so much better. It is not something that you can just belt out and then mic drop yourself out. So let&#8217;s examine the whole thing in unnecessarily deep detail. You might want to grab a cup of $beverage before continuing, this is going to take a while. ↫ Jussi Pakkanen I&#8217;m not a programmer so I&#8217;m leaving this for the smarter people among us to debate.]]>

        <![CDATA[The months keep slipping through our fingers, during this, our slow but relentless march towards the inevitability of certain death, so it&#8217;s time for another month of improvements to Redox, the general-purpose microkernel operating system written in Rust. This past month the work to bring various components of system76&#8217;s COSMIC desktop environment to Redox continues, with COSMIC Reader making its way to Redox. Jeremy Soller, creator of the Redox project and one of its primary engineers, will be using COSMIC Reader running on Redox to hold a presentation about Redox at RustConf. Aside from that important port, this month &#8211; in the middle of Summer on in this hemisphere &#8211; seems to mostly consist of a ton of smaller bugfixes and improvements. Relibc, Redox&#8217; C standard library, has seen a ton of work, as usual, a few ports were fixed and updated, like vim and OpenSSH, Orbital now has fullscreen support, and so, so much more.]]>
