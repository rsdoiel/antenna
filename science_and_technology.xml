Its creator, Andrew Yaros, has published a blog post diving into the why and how of LisaGUI. I had been trying to think of a good project to add to my programming portfolio, which was lacking. Finding an idea I was willing and able to execute on proved harder than expected. Good ideas are born from necessity and enthusiasm; trying to create a project for its own sake tends to be an uphill battle. I was also hoping to think of a specific project idea that hasn&#8217;t really been tried before. As you may have guessed by the title of this post, LisaGUI ended up being that project, although I didn&#8217;t really set out to make it as much as I stumbled into it while trying to accomplish something else. ↫ Andrew Yaros I&#8217;m someone who prefers to run the real thing on real hardware, but in a lot of cases, that&#8217;s just not realistic anymore. Hardware like the Apple Lisa are not only hard to find and expensive, they also require considerable knowledge and skill to maintain and possibly repair, which not everyone can do. For these types of machines, virtualisation, emulation, and recreation are much better, more accessible options, especially if it involves hardware and software you&#8217;re not interested enough in to spend time and money on them.]]>

Today on Short Wave, co-host [Regina G. Barber](https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber) dives into the science of our sleeping life with Michelle Carr.

        <![CDATA[In my detailed article about the Sun Microsystems ecosystem of the late 2000s, I mentioned an issue I ran into with the latest (leaked) patchset for Solaris 10, the one from 2020, available on Archive.org. Sun does not make Solaris 10 patches and patchsets from 2014 and later freely available online, restricting them to big enterprise customers with expensive support contracts. The same restrictions apply to mere support documents for Solaris 10, so that issues documented by Oracle, including causes and possible solutions, are only accessible to those with support contracts. The specific issue I ran into is that after installing the 2020 patchset, the Solaris Management Console, a GUI application written in Java with which you can manage certain aspects of your system, would no longer work. It would start up, but any settings panel you tried to load would throw up an RMI_ERR: error unmarshalling return, rendering the SMC effectively non-functional. This problem is documented in Oracle Doc ID 1559490.1, but of course, the Cause and Solution sections are hidden. I like weird commercial UNIX configuration GUIs, so even though you can do all of the SMC&#8217;s tasks with command-line tools, I still want it to work. Judging by the error and the countless references to Java updates, it&#8217;s easy to figure out that the root cause is an updated version of Java installed by the patchset that the SMC doesn&#8217;t like. You&#8217;d think uninstalling any relevant patches would solve the problem, but I tried that and it didn&#8217;t make a difference, so I was hoping Oracle perhaps had a later patch to fix the issue, or perhaps a proper workaround to get the SMC working again. Well, a screenshot of the remainder of that Oracle Doc ID mysteriously materialised on my Ultra 45 this morning, and it turns out that Oracle just&#8230; Doesn&#8217;t care. Honestly, I can&#8217;t blame them. Solaris 10 is old, outdated, pure legacy, and the very small number of organisations still using it are probably using it in Solaris Zones on servers anyway, and definitely not as a workstation/desktop operating system. There is zero incentive for Oracle to waste any time trying to fix this issue that, let&#8217;s be honest, really only affects one person in the entire world: me. Still, I wanted it fixed, and so I brute-forced a solution. It&#8217;s pretty straightforward: just change your default Java version back to one that the Solaris Management Console can work with. While I have Java 1.6.0 and 1.8.0 installed on the Ultra 45, with 1.6.0 being the default, the SMC will only work when 1.5.0 is set as your default Java version. There&#8217;s a wide variety of ways to do this, ranging from hatchets to scalpels, but considering nothing else on Solaris 10/SPARC on the Ultra 45 relies on 1.6.0 or later (as far as I can tell, at least), I took a hatchet approach and just changed the /usr/java symlink so that it pointed to 1.5.0 again. It&#8217;s that simple. Like I said, there are far more elegant ways of doing this, down to various scripts and other things to force only the SMC to use this specific Java version, but it&#8217;s not worth the effort to figure that out, and this works just as well. So, just in case there&#8217;s ever going to be a second person looking to fix this problem, here you are. You weird, weird person.]]>

      <title>Microsoft warns its new “AI” agents in Windows can install malware</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Microsoft has just announced a whole slew of new &#8220;AI&#8221; features for Windows, and this time, they&#8217;ll be living in your taskbar. Microsoft is trying to transform Windows into a “canvas for AI,” with new AI agents integrated into the Windows 11 taskbar. These new taskbar capabilities are designed to make AI agents feel like an assistant in Windows that can go off and control your PC and do tasks for you at the click of a button. It’s part of a broader overhaul of Windows to turn the operating system into an “agentic OS.”  Microsoft is integrating a variety of AI agents directly into the Windows 11 taskbar, including its own Microsoft 365 Copilot and third-party options. “This integration isn’t just about adding agents; it’s about making them part of the OS experience,” says Windows chief Pavan Davuluri. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge These &#8220;AI&#8221; agents will control your computer, applications, and files for you, which may make some of you a little apprehensive, and for good reason. &#8220;AI&#8221; tools don&#8217;t have a great track record when it comes to privacy &#8211; Windows Recall comes to mind &#8211; and as such, Microsoft claims this time, it&#8217;ll be different. These new &#8220;AI&#8221; agents will run in what are essentially dedicated Windows accounts acting as sandboxes, to ensure they can only access certain resources. While I find the addition of these &#8220;AI&#8221; tools to Windows insufferable and dumb, I&#8217;m at least glad Microsoft is taking privacy and security seriously this time, and I doubt Microsoft would repeat the same mistakes they made with the entirely botched rollout of Windows Recall. in addition, after the Cloudstrike fiasco, Microsoft made clear commitments to improve its security practices, which further adds to the confidence we should all have these new &#8220;AI&#8221; tools are safe, secure, and private. But wait, what&#8217;s this? Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation. ↫ Microsoft support document about the new &#8220;AI&#8221; features Microsoft&#8217;s new &#8220;AI&#8221; features can go out and install malware without your consent, because these features possess the access and privileges to do so. The mere idea that some application &#8211; which is essentially what these &#8220;AI&#8221; features really are &#8211; can go out onto the web and download and install whatever it wants, including malware, &#8220;on your behalf&#8221;, in the background, is so utterly dystopian to me I just can&#8217;t imagine any serious developer looking at this and thinking &#8220;yeah, ship it&#8221;. I&#8217;m living in an insane asylum.]]>

It’s part of a broader overhaul of Windows to turn the operating system into an “agentic OS.” Microsoft is integrating a variety of AI agents directly into the Windows 11 taskbar, including its own Microsoft 365 Copilot and third-party options. “This integration isn’t just about adding agents; it’s about making them part of the OS experience,” says Windows chief Pavan Davuluri. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge These “AI” agents will control your computer, applications, and files for you, which may make some of you a little apprehensive, and for good reason. “AI” tools don’t have a great track record when it comes to privacy – Windows Recall comes to mind – and as such, Microsoft claims this time, it’ll be different. These new “AI” agents will run in what are essentially dedicated Windows accounts acting as sandboxes, to ensure they can only access certain resources. While I find the addition of these “AI” tools to Windows insufferable and dumb, I’m at least glad Microsoft is taking privacy and security seriously this time, and I doubt Microsoft would repeat the same mistakes they made with the entirely botched rollout of Windows Recall. in addition, after the Cloudstrike fiasco, Microsoft made clear commitments to improve its security practices, which further adds to the confidence we should all have these new “AI” tools are safe, secure, and private. But wait, what’s this? Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation. ↫ Microsoft support document about the new “AI” features Microsoft’s new “AI” features can go out and install malware without your consent, because these features possess the access and privileges to do so. The mere idea that some application – which is essentially what these “AI” features really are – can go out onto the web and download and install whatever it wants, including malware, “on your behalf”, in the background, is so utterly dystopian to me I just can’t imagine any serious developer looking at this and thinking “yeah, ship it”. I’m living in an insane asylum.</source:markdown>

At that time, the company offered a variety of products that, when used together, formed a comprehensive ecosystem that was a fascinating, albeit expensive alternative to Microsoft and Apple. While not really intended for home use, I&#8217;ve always believed that Sun&#8217;s approach to computing would&#8217;ve made for an excellent computing environment in the home. Since I was but a wee university student in the late 2000s living in a small apartment, I did not have the financial means nor the space to really test this hypothesis. Now, though, Sun&#8217;s products from that era are decidedly retro, and a lot more approachable &#8211; especially if you have incredibly generous readers. So sit down and buckle up, because we&#8217;ve got a long one today. If you wish to support OSNews and longform content like this, consider becoming a Patreon or donating to our Ko-Fi. Note that absolutely zero generative &#8220;AI&#8221; was used in the writing of this article. No &#8220;AI&#8221; writing aids, no &#8220;AI&#8221; summaries, no ChatGPT, no Gemini search nonsense, nothing. I take pride in doing research and writing properly, without the &#8220;aid&#8221; of digital parrots with brain damage, and if there&#8217;s any errors, they&#8217;re mine and mine alone. Take pride in your work and reject &#8220;AI&#8221;. The Ultra 45: the central hub In the early 2000s, it had already become obvious that the future of workstations lied not with custom architectures, bespoke processors, and commercial UNIX variants, but with standard x86, off-the-shelf Intel and AMD processors, and Windows and Linux. The writing was on the wall, everyone knew it, and the ensuing consolidation on x86 turned into a veritable bloodbath. In the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, many of these ISAs were touted as vastly superior x86 killers, but fast-forward a decade or two, and x86 had bested them all in both price and performance, leaving behind a trail of dead ISAs. Never bet against x86. Virtually none of the commercial UNIX variants survived the one-two punch of losing the ISA they were married to and the rising popularity of Linux in the workstation space. HP-UX was tied to HP&#8217;s PA-RISC, and both died. SGI&#8217;s IRIX was tied to MIPS, and both died. Tru64 was tied to Alpha, and both died. The two exceptions are IBM&#8217;s AIX and Sun&#8217;s Solaris. AIX workstations were phased out, but AIX is still nominally in development for POWER servers, but wholly inaccessible to anyone who doesn&#8217;t wear a suit and has a massive corporate spending budget. Solaris, meanwhile, which had long been available on x86, saw its &#8220;own&#8221; ISA SPARC live on in the server space until roughly 2017 or so, and was even briefly available as open source until Oracle did its thing. As a result, Solaris and its derivative Illumos are still nominally in active development, but in the grand scheme of things they&#8217;re barely even a blip on the radar in 2025. Never bet against Linux. During these tumultuous times, the various commercial UNIX vendors all pushed out systems that would become the final hurrahs of their respective UNIX workstation lines. DEC, then owned by HP, released its AlphaStation ES47 in 2003, marking the end of the road for Alpha and Tru64 UNIX. HP&#8217;s own PA-RISC architecture and HP-UX met their end with the HP c8000 (which I own), an all-out PA-RISC monster with two dual-core processors running at 1.1GHz. SGI gave its MIPS line of machines running IRIX a massive send-off with the enigmatic and rare Tezro in 2003. In 2005, IBM tried one last time with the IntelliStation POWER 285, followed a few months later by the heavily cut-down 185, the final AIX workstation. And Sun unveiled the Ultra 45, its final SPARC workstation, in 2006. Sun was already in the middle of its transition to x86 with machines like the Sun Java Desktop System and its successors, the Ultra 20 and 40, and then surprised everyone by reviving their UltraSPARC workstation line with the Ultra 25 and 45, which shared most &#8211; all? &#8211; of their enclosures with their x86 brethren. They were beautiful, all-aluminium machines with gorgeous interior layouts, and a striking full-grill front, somewhat inspired by the PowerMac G5 of that era. And ever since the Ultra 45 was rumoured in late 2005 and then became available in early 2006, I&#8217;ve been utterly obsessed with it. It&#8217;s taken almost two decades, but thanks to an unfathomably generous donation from KDE e.V. board member and FreeBSD contributor Adriaan de Groot, a very unique and storied Sun Ultra 45 and a whole slew of accessories showed up at my doorstep only a few weeks ago. Let&#8217;s look back upon this piece of history that is but a footnote to most, but a whole book to me &#8211; and experience Sun&#8217;s ecosystem from around 2006, today. First and foremost, I want to express my deep gratitude to Adriaan de Groot. Without him, none of this would have been possible, and I can&#8217;t put into words how grateful I am. He donated this Ultra 45 to me at no cost &#8211; not even the cost of shipping &#8211; and he also shipped another box to me containing a few Sun Ray thin clients, completing the late 2000s Sun ecosystem I now own. Since the Ultra 45 was technically owned by KDE e.V. &#8211; more on that below &#8211; I&#8217;d also like to thank the KDE e.V. Board for giving Adriaan permission for the donation. I&#8217;d also like to thank Volker A. Brandt, who sent me a Sun Ray 3, a few Ultra 45 hard drive brackets, and some other Sun goodies. The Sun Ultra 45 De Groot sent me was a base model with an upgraded GPU.

      <title>Using Rust in Android speeds up development considerably</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143799/using-rust-in-android-speeds-up-development-considerably/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Google has been using Rust in Android more and more for its memory safety characteristics, and the results on that front were quite positive. It turns out, however, that not only does using Rust reduce the number memory safety issues, it&#8217;s also apparently a lot faster to code in Rust than C or C++. We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust&#8217;s impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one. ↫ Jeff Vander Stoep at the Google Security Blog When you think about it, it actually makes sense. If you have fewer errors of a certain type, you&#8217;ll spend less time fixing those issues, time which you can then spend developing new code. Of course, it&#8217;s not that simple and there&#8217;s a ton more factors to consider, but on a base level, it definitely makes sense. Spellcheck in word processors means you have to spend less time detecting and fixing spelling errors, so you have more time to spend on actually writing. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll all be very civil about this, and nobody will be weird about Rust at all.]]>

      <title>Haiku gets new guarded heap for the kernel</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143797/haiku-gets-new-guarded-heap-for-the-kernel/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Another month, another Haiku activity report, and this time we&#8217;ve got a major change under the hood: a brand new guarded heap. The old guarded heap was suboptimal and had started to lag behind, so the new one attempts to rectify some of these shortcomings. So, to rectify these limitations, I rewrote the kernel guarded heap more or less from scratch, taking the old code into account where it made sense but otherwise creating entirely new bookkeeping structures, interacting directly with the page table and virtual memory systems, and more. This new guarded heap implementation frees physical pages when not in use, meaning that the “virtual memory reuse disabled” mode now runs for quite long periods of time (indeed, I could successfully boot to the desktop and run compile jobs.) It also prints more diagnostics when kernel panics due to memory faults inside the heap happen, which the old kernel guarded heap didn’t (but the userland one has always done). ↫ Haiku&#8217;s activity report for October The new guarded heap is optional for now, but Haiku is planning on releasing some pre-built test builds so users can start testing it out. Of course, this isn&#8217;t the only change or improvement from this past month &#8211; the list of changes is long, but there&#8217;s no real tentpole features here. Haiku&#8217;s development pace is still very much on track.]]>

        <![CDATA[It’s another news roundup! This time, we cover how, using data analytics – and ironically, some AI – a team at Cornell University has mapped the environmental impact of AI by state. They determined that, by 2030, the rate of AI growth in the U.S. would put an additional 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The team further calculated that by 2030, AI could use as much water as 6 to 10 millions Americans do every year. All of this, they conclude, would put the tech industry’s climate goals out of reach. This episode, we also get into the potential for life on one of Saturn’s moons and a new discovery about why chameleons’ eyes are so special. <br/><br/><br><em>Interested in reporting on the environmental impact of AI?

      <title>Valve brings x86 gaming to ARM Linux with FEX</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143782/valve-brings-x86-gaming-to-arm-linux-with-fex/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Valve announced a few new devices yesterday. There&#8217;s a new Steam console, which is essentially just a tiny PC with SteamOS installed &#8211; think of it as a Steam Deck without a display. Second, Valve finally released a new Steam Controller to go with the Steam console, which has taken them long enough. Lastly, there&#8217;s a brand new Steam VR headset, the Steam Frame. Other websites with actual access to these new devices will do a better job of covering them than I ever could, but I do want to highlight something crucially important about the Steam Frame: it contains a Snapdragon ARM processor, but can still run Steam and all of its games. How does this work? Well, after developing Proton to allow Windows games to run on Linux, Valve &#8220;introduced&#8221; FEX, which will allow you to run x86 Windows games on ARM Linux. I put the quotation marks there because FEX was an existing project Valve invested heavily into in recent times, and it&#8217;s now at the point where Valve seems confident enough it will be capable of running enough x86 games on ARM Linux. As such, the Steam Frame runs full SteamOS with KDE Plasma, you can run x86 Steam games, and as an additional bonus, you can install Android APKs as well. I&#8217;ve yet to even try VR, because I&#8217;m not particularly interested in buying into any locked-down platform. The Steam Frame may be the first VR device I&#8217;ll buy &#8211; depending on price, of course &#8211; and the Steam console definitely looks like a great addition to the living room, too. My wife and I have little to no interesting in buying an Xbox or PS5, but having easy, no-hassle access to our massive Steam libraries on our TV will be awesome.]]>

      <title>VMS/XDE: an OpenVMS x86 development environment for Linux and Windows/WSL</title>

        <![CDATA[VMS/XDE is an OpenVMS x86 development environment for Linux and WIndows (via WSL). It provides a familiar user experience for OpenVMS developers working in Linux and Windows yet offers 100% binary and file system compatilibilty with OpenVMS. VMS/XDE includes OpenVMS V9.2-3 user, supervisor and executive mode operating system environments and a set of x86 native compilers and layered products geared towards OpenVMS software development and testing. ↫ VMS/XDE website VMS/XDE is a beta version, and comes with the usual annoying OpenVMS x86 time bombs, this time exploding on 3 January 2026. If you intend to use the finalised commercial version after the beta period ends, you&#8217;ll have to employ the same licenses as regular OpenVMS. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess, but that&#8217;s the OpenVMS way, sadly &#8211; and I don&#8217;t blame them, either, as I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re hamstrung by a ton of agreements and restrictions imposed upon them by HP. Regardless, VMS/XDE brings a zero setup OpenVMS environment to the operating system you&#8217;re already using, making it easier to develop and cross-compile for the platform. I still have absolutely no clue just how many people OpenVMS is still relevant for, but I absolutely adore the fact VMS Software Inc. is working on this. In a world where so many of its former competitors are being held hostage by corporate indifference, it&#8217;s refreshing to see VMS still moving forward.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[As part of the KDE Plasma 6.5 release, we also got a new release of Plasma Mobile. As there&#8217;s a lot of changes, improvements, and new features in Plasma Mobile 6.5, the Plasma Mobile Team published a blog post to highlight them all. The biggest improvement is probably the further integration of Waydroid, a necessary evil to run Android applications until the Plasma Mobile ecosystem manages to become a bit more well-rounded. Waydroid can now be managed straight from the settings application and the quick settings dropdown. Furthermore, the lockscreen has been improved considerably, there&#8217;s been a ton of polish for the home screen and the user interface in general, the quick settings panel can now be customised to make it fit better on different form factors, the first early test version of the new Plasma mobile keyboard is included, and so much more. This is definitely a release I would want to try out, but since I don&#8217;t have any of the supported devices, I&#8217;m a bit stuck. This is, of course, one of the two major problems facing proper mobile Linux: the lack of device support. It&#8217;s improving due to the tireless work of countless volunteers, but they&#8217;re always going to be swimming upstream. The other major problem is, of course, application availability, but at least Waydroid can bridge the gap for the adventurous among us.]]>

The zap install command now installs dependencies by default, while zap create-user will now restrict new home directories to mode 0700 by default.

        <![CDATA[Jonathan Pallant got lucky and managed to score a massive haul of &#8217;90s UNIX workstations, one of which was an HP 9000 Model 340, a HP-UX workstation built around a Motorola 68030 processor at 16.7 MHz. It doesn&#8217;t come with a hard drive or even a floppy controller, though, so he decided to borrow a PA-RISC-based HP 9000 Model 705 to set up an HP-UX 9 cluster. But wait, how does that work, when we&#8217;re dealing with two entirely different architectures? What&#8217;s more fun though, is putting it into a cluster with the Model 705 and network booting it. Yes, that a 68030 machine network booting from a PA-RISC machine &#8230; and&#160;sharing the same root filesystem. But aren&#8217;t PA-RISC binaries and 68K binaries quite different? Oh yes, they really are. So, how does that work? ↫ Jonathan Pallant HP-UX is far more interesting and fascinating than a lot of people give it credit for, and while my interest lies with HP-UX 11i, I find what Pallant is doing here with HP-UX 9 just as fascinating. You first need to install HP-UX 9 for PA-RISC on the 700 series machine, convert it to a cluster server, and then install HP-UX 9 for 68k on top of that PA-RISC installation. After this is done, you effectively end up with a single root file system that contains both PA-RISC and 68k binaries, and you can network boot the 68k-based Model 340 right from it &#8211; using the same root filesystem on both machines. Absolutely wild. No, these are not universal binaries or some other trick you might know of from more modern system. In fact, installing the 68k version of HP-UX 9 &#8220;into&#8221; the PA-RISC HP-UX 9 cluster server, you end up with something called a Context Dependent Filesystem. To get a better idea of what this means and how this works, you should really head on over to Pallant&#8217;s excellent article for all the details.]]>

      <title>Ironclad 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 released, adds RISC-V support</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143737/ironclad-0-7-0-and-0-8-0-released-adds-risc-v-support/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We&#8217;ve talked about Ironclad a few times, but there&#8217;s been two new releases since the 0.6.0 release we covered last, so let&#8217;s see what the project&#8217;s been up to. As a refresher, Ironclad is a formally verified, hard real-time capable kernel written in SPARK and Ada. Versions 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 improved support for block device caching, added a basic NVMe driver, added support for x86’s SMAP, switched from KVM to NVMM for Ironclad’s virtualization interface, and much, much more. In the meantime, Ironclad also added support for RISC-V, making it usable on any 64 bit RISC-V target that supports a Limine-protocol compatible bootloader. The easiest way to try out Ironclad is to download Gloire, a distribution that uses Ironclad and the GNU tools. It can be installed in both a virtual machine and on real hardware.]]>

      <title>Mac OS 7.6 and 8 for CHRP releases discovered</title>

        <![CDATA[For those of us unaware &#8211; unlikely on OSNews, but still &#8211; for a hot minute in the second half of the &#8217;90s, Apple licensed its Mac OS to OEMs, resulting in officially sanctioned Mac clones from a variety of companies. While intended to grow the Mac&#8217;s market share, what ended up happening instead is that the clone makers outcompeted Apple on performance, price, and features, with clones offering several features and capabilities before Apple did &#8211; for far lower prices. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he killed the clone program almost instantly. The rather abrupt end of the clone program means there&#8217;s a number of variants of the Mac OS that never made their way into the market, most notable variants intended for the Common Reference Hardware Platform, or CHRP, a standard defined by IBM and Apple for PowerPC-based PCs. Thanks to the popular classic Mac YouTuber Mac84, we now have a few of these releases out in the wild. These CDs contain release candidates for Mac OS 7.6 and Mac OS 8 for CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform) systems. They were created to support CHRP computers, but were never released, likely due to Steve Jobs returning to Apple in September 1997 and eliminating the Mac Clone program and any CHRP efforts. ↫ Mac OS 7.6/8 CHRP releases page Mac84 has an accompanying video diving into more detail about these individual releases by booting and running them in an emulator, so we can get a better idea of what they contain. While most clone makers only got access to Mac OS 7.x, some of them did, in fact, gain access to Mac OS 8, namely UMAX and Power Computing (the latter of which was acquired by Apple). It&#8217;s not the clone nature of these releases that make them special, but the fact they&#8217;re CHRP releases is. This reference platform was a failure in the market, and only a few of IBM&#8217;s own machines and some of Motorola&#8217;s PowerStack machines properly supported it. Apple, meanwhile, only aid minor lip service to CHRP in its New World Power Macintosch machines.]]>

        <![CDATA[The FreeBSD Foundation is pleased to announce that it has completed work to build FreeBSD without requiring root privilege. We have implemented support for all source release builds to use no-root infrastructure, eliminating the need for root privileges across the FreeBSD release pipeline. This work was completed as part of the&#160;program commissioned by the Sovereign Tech Agency. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation blog This is great news in and of itself, but there&#8217;s more: FreeBSD has also improved build reproducability. This means that given the same source input, you should end up with the same binary output, which is an important part of building a verifiable chain of trust. These two improvements combined further add to making FreeBSD a trustworthy, secure option &#8211; something it already is anyway. In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, the FreeBSD project and its countless contributors are making a ton of tangible progress lately on a wide variety of topics, from improving desktop use, to solidifying Wi-Fi support, to improving the chain of trust. I think the time is quite right for FreeBSD to make some inroads in the desktop UNIX-y space, especially for people to whom desktop Linux has strayed too far from the traditional UNIX philosphy (whatever that means).]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Redox keeps improving every month, and this past one is certainly a banger. The big news this past month is that Servo, the browser engine written in Rust, has been ported to Redox. It&#8217;s extremely spartan at the moment, and crashes when a second website is loaded, but it&#8217;s a promising start. It also just makes sense to have the premier Rust browser engine running on the premier Rust operating system. Htop and bottom have been ported to Redox for much improved system monitoring, and they&#8217;re joined by a port of GoAccess. The version of Rust has been updated which fixed some issues, and keyboard layout configuration has been greatly improved. Instead of a few hardcoded layouts, they can now be configured dynamically for users of PS/2 keyboards, with USB keyboards receiving this functionality soon as well. There&#8217;s more, of course, as well as the usual slew of low-level changes and improvements to drivers, the kernel relibc, and more.]]>

        <![CDATA[Some people not only have a very particular set of skills, but also a very particular set of interests that happen to align with those skills perfectly. When several unidentified and mysterious IBM PC ROM chips from the 1980s were discovered on eBay, two particular chips&#8217; dumped contents posed particularly troublesome to identify. In 1985, the FCh model byte could only mean the 5170 (PC/AT), and the even/odd byte interleaving does point at a 16-bit bus. But there are three known versions of the PC/AT BIOS released during the 5170 family&#8217;s lifetime, corresponding to the three AT motherboard types. This one here is clearly not one of them: its date stamps and part numbers don&#8217;t match, and the actual contents are substantially different besides. My first thought was that this may have come from one of those more shadowy members of the 5170 family: perhaps the AT/370, the 3270 AT/G(X), or the rack-mounted 7532 Industrial AT. But known examples of those carry the same firmware sets as the plain old 5170, so their BIOS extensions (if any) came in the shape of extra adapter ROMs. Whatever&#160;this&#160;thing was &#8211; some other 5170-type machine, a prototype, or even just a custom patch &#8211; it seemed I&#8217;d have to inquire within for any further clues. ↫ VileR at the int10h.org blog I&#8217;ll be honest and state that most of the in-depth analysis of the code dumped from the ROM chips is far too complex for me to follow, but that doesn&#8217;t make the story it tells any less interesting. There&#8217;s no definitive, 100% conclusive answer at the end, but the available evidence collected by VileR does make a very strong case for a very specific, mysterious variant of the IBM PC being the likely source of the ROMs. If you&#8217;re interested in some very deep IBM lore, here&#8217;s your serving.]]>

User interaction on performance-starved platforms like the PinePhone has become visibly smoother thanks our recent CPU scheduling advances. The streamlined block-storage stack combined with various refinements of the package-installation mechanism make the on-target installation of 3rd-party components a bliss. Regarding supported hardware, we steadily follow the tireless work of the Linux kernel community. All PC driver components using Linux kernel code are now consistently based on kernel version 6.12. ↫ Sculpt OS 25.10 release announcement There&#8217;s also an optional brand new configuration format, which optionally replaces Scultp&#8217;s use of XML for this purpose. Norman Feske, one of the co-founders of Genode Labs, published an article detailing how to test this new format, which also goes much deeper into how it works. For Sculpt OS&#8217; 25.10 release, Alexander Böttcher has also released an experimental image with five different kernel to choose from. The image is for PC, and works as a live system so there&#8217;s no need to install it to explore Sculpt OS. Speaking of Alexander Böttcher, he also published an article about improvements and changes to Sculpt OS&#8217; lockscreen component. This component has existed for a very long time, and has been improved considerably over the years, and Böttcher&#8217;s article details how to install it, configure it, and use it.]]>

      <title>Debian to add hard Rust dependency to APT</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143696/debian-to-add-hard-rust-dependency-to-apt/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It seems like a number of Debian ports are going to face difficult times over the coming months. Debian developer Julian Andres Klode has sent a message to the Debian mailing lists that APT will very soon start requiring Rust. I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem. In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to unit testing. ↫ Julian Andres Klode The problem for a lot of architectures that Debian supports, in one way or another, is that Rust and its toolchain simply aren&#8217;t available for them. As such, Julian Andres Klode states, rather directly, that these architectures have about six months to get themselves a full Rust toolchain, or sunset their Debian ports. The Debian PA-RISC (hppa) and Alpha ports, for instance, do not have a Rust toolchain port, and most likely won&#8217;t be getting one either, especially not within six months. The reasoning for moving towards a hard Rust dependency for APT is the same as it is in every other similar case: Debian&#8217;s and APT&#8217;s developers want to be able to make use of modern tools and technologies, even if that means dead architectures get left behind. As much as I am a massive fan of retro-architectures like PA-RISC, I really don&#8217;t want otherwise modern Linux distributions to eschew modern tools and technologies just because they&#8217;re not available for an architecture that died in 2005. I own and use the last and most powerful PA-RISC workstation running HP-UX as a retro platform, so I definitely care &#8211; but I really don&#8217;t expect Debian or Fedora or whatever to waste any resources on supporting them if that means holding the distributions back for everyone else using it on actually modern platforms. If there&#8217;s a large enough community of people around such architectures, they&#8217;ll keep the Linux train running. If not, well, that&#8217;s life.]]>

      <title>Configuring cwm on OpenBSD</title>
      <link>https://www.osnews.com/story/143692/configuring-cwm-on-openbsd/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For those unfamiliar, cwm is the Calm Window Manager. It’s part of the OpenBSD base distribution as one of the native window managers, along with an old version of fvwm and the venerable twm. It’s pretty simple but surprisingly powerful, a floating window manager with some basic manual tiling. It’s keyboard-centric, has an application launcher and highly configurable menus. It uses groups rather than workspaces which provides a lot of flexibility. My configuration isn’t particularly groundbreaking, but it’s comfy and suits me well. I can happily live in it indefinitely, though I do split my time between cwm and Xfce with occasional forays into other window managers or Wayland compositors. This has nothing to do with cwm limitations and everything to do with me being curious and craving novelty. It’s cwm that I return to, because it’s entirely unsurprising and very capable, and also because it’s part of OpenBSD’s base so I know I’m dealing with software that’s been refined and audited and refined again. ↫ Antony Fox-Bramwell If you opt for a default installation of something like OpenBSD, without any additional desktop environments like Xfce, when you start X, you&#8217;ll be served with the default OpenBSD window manager: cwm, or the calm window manager. At first glance, it looks incredibly basic and, to most people, archaic and unusable, but what it lacks in sparkles and boondoggles it more than makes up for in flexibility and configurability. The problem, however, is that it&#8217;s not exactly intuitive to mold cwm into something that works for you. Articles like this one, by Antony Fox-Bramwell, function as great springboards into the world of configuring cwm. If you do an internet search for similar articles, you&#8217;ll find tons of other examples that can help you become more capable at configuring cwm. Most of us are probably just fine accepting something like KDE or Xfce, but if those just don&#8217;t scratch your itch, diving into cwm could be just what you&#8217;re looking for.]]>
