INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-find-beta-readers','How to Find Beta Readers',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>When you&#39;ve finished the manuscript of your book, it&#39;s a good idea to get some feedback. Just as beta testers try out pre-release software, beta readers look at manuscripts and give feedback. They look at your work as a reader - not as an editor or proofreader, looking to improve grammar - and tell you whether you have succeeded in keeping their interest and whether they think the story works. You need both positive and negative feedback, and good beta readers can help by providing this.</p>\r\n\r\nWhy use beta readers?\r\n\r\n<p>Writing a book is a complicated process, and it can be hard to be objective about your work after you&#39;ve spent months or years writing it. Beta readers can help by offering you criticism and feedback about the work, and help you improve the book before submitting it to an agent or editor. Don&#39;t send out a first draft to beta readers; this draft needs polishing, and it&#39;s not useful to ask for feedback on a work in that state. The time to use beta readers is when you feel that your manuscript is finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beta readers should be people who read widely, and specifically in the genre in which you write. Effective beta readers need to be able to provide honest, constructive feedback, and critique the writing in a way that helps the author polish their manuscript. Beta readers should be able to give opinions about character, plot, tone, voice, and other elements of your writing, even though they may not know the technical terms used when talking about these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beta readers also need to be reliable. It&#39;s a big ask to request feedback on an word 80,000 manuscript, and even fast readers will take several days to read a text like this. If your beta readers put off reading your work, you may be frustrated, and if they never get back to you, you&#39;ll have missed out on useful feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding good beta readers can be difficult. Some writers have spouses, partners, or friends who they use as beta readers, and this is practical, if these people can give the type of opinions needed at this stage of writing. But it is often not a good idea to use family members as beta readers; unless they are experienced in this exercise, they are unlikely to give any negative feedback, because they won&#39;t want to hurt your feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be frustrating if you give your manuscript to a friend and they say, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s very nice,&quot; or something general like that. A beta reader is not a reviewer, but someone capable of pointing out strengths and weaknesses in a work. This is different from a critique partner, who is another writer with whom you trade feedback; this feedback can be more technical, about the writing itself.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat should beta readers do?\r\n\r\n<p>When you find beta readers, don&#39;t just send them your manuscript without any guidance. You should tell beta readers so they know what sort of critique you&#39;re looking for. You can ask for any or all of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	A general review of the book: is it enjoyable, did they feel the urge to keep reading?\r\n	Are the characters believable, and are the main characters&#39; motivations clear?\r\n	Do the settings feel real?\r\n	Is anything over-described?\r\n	Does the dialog feel authentic?\r\n	Is the plot believable, and does the resolution make sense?\r\n	Are sentences, paragraphs, or chapters too long or too short? Does the prose flow, or does it feel choppy?\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also, if there are any specific points that you want them to look for, make sure to mention them.</p>\r\n\r\nHow can you find beta readers?\r\n\r\n<p>You can find beta readers in many ways. There are many websites that connect writers with beta readers. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/50920-beta-reader-group" target="_blank">Goodreads has a large beta readers group</a>, and you can look for beta readers there. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/" target="_blank">Reddit also has a beta readers group</a>, and there are a number of Facebook groups for beta readers. There are also many websites that offer free and paid beta reader services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you look at various websites, such as those above, you&#39;ll see that many beta readers offer paid services. Reading a manuscript does take a fair amount of time, as does providing valuable comments and feedback. If you pay someone to beta read your book, you&#39;re likely to get a quicker response, and perhaps even more negative feedback, or constructive criticism, than what friends will give you. Paid beta readers see this as a job, and may be more thorough in their feedback, but they may also limit their feedback to what they think is worth the amount they are paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a later stage, you may want to pay someone to read your work to perform certain tasks, such as copy editing, fact-checking, or sensitivity reading. But these professionals work at the final stage of your writing, when you have completed your final draft. Beta readers may have some knowledge of these elements, but it&#39;s not up to them to take on these tasks.</p>\r\n\r\nHow to prepare your Scrivener project for beta readers\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to send a draft to beta readers is to create a PDF from your Scrivener project. You do this using Scrivener&#39;s Compile feature. You can choose what to include in your PDF; whether you want the entire draft, or only part of it, if you&#39;re not asking for feedback on the entire work.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-find-a-literary-agent','How to Find a Literary Agent',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Whether you&#39;ve been working on a book for years, or you just finished one after starting it in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), the next step is publication. If you wish to have your book published through a traditional publisher, you need to find an agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literary agents have multiple roles. They seek out new talent, negotiate contracts, but also serve as gatekeepers for publishers. Most traditional publishers don&#39;t accept unagented submissions, so it is essential to find an agent if you want your book to be handled by a large publisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips to help you find an agent.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat do literary agents do?\r\n\r\n<p>On the most basic level, a literary agent negotiates a contract between an author, and a publisher. They determine the best fit between book and publisher, and, benefiting from their connections with editors, submit manuscripts to publishers. They may also negotiate other contracts, such as for foreign rights, or film and TV rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But literary agents do much more than that. When an agent finds an author whose work they like, they help that author hone their book. They offer editorial suggestions, and help an author refine their voice. Since literary agents make a percentage of what authors receive from publishers, it is in their interest to help authors develop their career. They give tips to authors, sharing their expertise, and help authors think beyond just one book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these services, literary agents generally earn 15% of what an author makes from publishers. This is enough to motivate the agent to obtain better terms for contracts, and to seek out new opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\nDo you need a literary agent to get published?\r\n\r\n<p>Decide whether you want to go the traditional publishing route or self publish your book There are plenty of authors making a career through self publishing, but the traditional publishing channel has many advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have written a general fiction or non-fiction book, and want to be published by the large traditional publishers, then you need an agent. If you are an academic, seeking publication by a specialist publisher, then you&nbsp;generally don&#39;t need an agent. If you want to submit a book to a midsize publisher, some may accept unagented manuscripts, but many will not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you self publish, you do everything on your own. You&#39;re responsible for things like copy editing, cover design, marketing, and promotion. See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/navigating-the-publishing-process-traditional-vs-self-publishing" target="_blank">Navigating the Publishing Process: Traditional vs. Self-Publishing</a> for a comparison of the two publishing options.</p>\r\n\r\nHow do you find a literary agent?\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of literary agents, so it can be hard to find one who fits with what you&#39;ve written. Start by looking at authors you appreciate, in the genre in which you write. This doesn&#39;t mean that if you write horror fiction you should try to snag Stephen King&#39;s agent; look at mid-list authors and who represents them. Most authors will mention the name of their agent on their website. <a href="https://www.publishersmarketplace.com" target="_blank">Publishers Marketplace</a> is a good website to find agents, to find out which authors agents have published, and the type of deals they&#39;ve concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you&#39;ve made a list of several agents, visit their websites to see if they&#39;re accepting new clients. If so, carefully read their submission guidelines. Prepare your manuscript appropriately; many agents get so many submissions that they will ignore any submissions that don&#39;t comply with their guidelines. Some agents may want to see a synopsis and the first ten or twenty pages of a book; others may want to see more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should then write a query letter. This should contain information about your book, title, genre, and its word count, one to two paragraphs describing the book, and some information about you, your experience, why you wrote the book, and why you think the agent might be right for your work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You shouldn&#39;t expect the first agent you contact to be interested in your manuscript. Identify several agents, maybe a dozen or more, and send your query letter to all of them. And make sure each letter is personalized. For example, mention other authors the agent manages whose books are similar to yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many may not respond, some may respond, saying they&#39;re not interested, and, if you&#39;re lucky, you may get a nibble. It&#39;s a good idea to keep a list of the agents you write to in a spreadsheet, so you don&#39;t accidentally send another query letter to an agent you&#39;ve already contacted, but also to follow up if you haven&#39;t heard back in the time they say they will take to look over your work. Many agents will say that they simply won&#39;t reply if they&#39;re not interested, but if you haven&#39;t heard back, it can&#39;t hurt to nudge, in case your submission slipped through the cracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t assume that the first agent who is interested in looking at your manuscript is the right one for you. Working with a literary agent is a two-way relationship, and, even if you find one agent who likes your manuscript, you need to figure out if they are the right fit. You will eventually have some telephone or zoom conversations, and you&#39;ll be able to tell if this agent is someone that you would like to work with. Remember, if you find the right agent, you will be working with them for your entire career. This isn&#39;t exactly like a marriage, but it is a long-term relationship, so it&#39;s important that you be compatible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the right literary agent is important for your book, and for your potential writing career. Make sure you research agents carefully, pinpoint the ones that seem appropriate for your work, and send out query letters. You may get rejections, you may even get lots of rejections, but if your work is good enough, you will find an agent.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

Fear you won&rsquo;t be able to do justice to the story you&rsquo;ve perfected in your head. Fear you won&rsquo;t be able to finish the project, so why bother continuing?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When that all-too-familiar creative paralysis hits, it can feel as though your own mind is stonewalling you. Like a petulant child with a pout, crossed arms and a fierce scowl, your mind doesn&rsquo;t want to play. You plead with it for one teeny tiny fruitful idea. One solution to a creative problem. One way to neatly sew up a nagging plot hole. But nothing is working. The child has plonked themselves down on the ground, refusing to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As frustrating as <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/overcoming-writers-block-how-to-rekindle-your-creativity" target="_blank">writer&rsquo;s block</a> can be, it can sometimes be a sign you shouldn&rsquo;t ignore. A sign you need to step away from your current writing project and try something different. Enter: flash fiction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the words just won&rsquo;t come, here are 5 ways flash fiction can help you overcome that mental block.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/dreamstime-m-30990304.jpg" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <strong>1. Get a quick win</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>With its short length, anything from&nbsp;<a href="https://writers.com/how-to-write-flash-fiction" target="_blank">a few words or paragraphs up to 1,500 words</a>, it&rsquo;s easier to start and finish a flash piece than a short story or an even larger project like a novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting a new short-short story finished quickly will give you a satisfying dose of closure and boost your confidence. It&rsquo;ll give you a quick win to reaffirm your faith in your writing abilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with a large writing project, you could try writing a tangential flash story. Step away from the lengthy plot and character development work you&rsquo;re thinking about. Focus instead on one particular moment or significant memory from your character&rsquo;s past.&nbsp;This will help you get back into the writing style and feverish creativity you started with before endless drafting and editing pulled you into a problem-solving mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Mental reset&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever wished you could capture that flow state where an initial idea arrives? That moment of magic where the words come pouring out and more ideas come to flesh out the first idea, where you&rsquo;re typing with fury to capture it all before, inevitably, it disappears like smoke into the ether.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, scientists haven&rsquo;t yet figured out a way to bottle that state to allow you to take regular sips at every dip in an ambitious writing project. But taking regular breaks to write a piece of flash fiction could be the elixir you&rsquo;re looking for. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve been staring at that blinking cursor for so long you&rsquo;re starting to resent your writing project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/walk-away-from-your-writing/#:~:text=Sometimes%20simply%20walking%20away%20for,two%2C%20perhaps%20over%20the%20weekend." target="_blank">taking time away can give your mind the reset</a>&nbsp;it desperately needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By providing a constructive distraction from the boredom, frustration and mental fatigue of writing something ambitious, this practice will get you back to basics. It&rsquo;ll let you come back to your main writing project with fresh eyes and, hopefully, a mind fizzing with fresh ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Sharpen your skills&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Flash forces you to be concise. When you don&rsquo;t have the space to wander off exploring a major dramatic scene or hour-long pivotal conversation in your story,&nbsp;<a href="https://ounews.co/arts-social-sciences/the-art-of-brevity-5-benefits-of-writing-flash-fiction/#:~:text=Flash%2Dfiction%20teaches%20those%20very,on%20the%20most%20salient%20points." target="_blank">flash fiction gives you the creative constraint you need to get straight to the point</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the ideal form to experiment with if you&rsquo;re struggling to kill your darlings. Flash pushes you to kill, bury and walk away from those darlings and focus solely on one key moment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This practice will help you take a whetstone to your writing skills. You can also use the form to focus on specific elements of your writing. For example, you could write a flash piece that is entirely dialogue and use the exercise to get to the root of the way your characters communicate and who dominates the conversation and why.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>4.&nbsp;Develop a regular writing routine</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as writing flash can give you a quick win, it can also help you develop a&nbsp;<a href="https://writingcooperative.com/9-important-ways-you-will-benefit-from-writing-every-day-c5766b47b14c" target="_blank">regular writing routine</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no strict word count, you can create a low-pressure writing routine around flash fiction. Especially if you&rsquo;re between projects and want to hold off on the urge to jump into a new novel draft, regularly writing flash fiction will keep your writing brain active and sharp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if your daily target was one flash story, you could write a few sentences one day, 1,000 words the next and 100 words the day after that. With the fluidity of this form, you can remove intimidating word counts and give yourself the freedom to pause, create and slowly chip away at loftier goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Inspiration for future writing projects&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to start a new writing project but you&rsquo;re lacking inspiration,&nbsp;<a href="https://jerichowriters.com/flash-fiction-prompts/" target="_blank">flash fiction is a great way to tease out those ideas</a>&nbsp;buried in the back of your mind and put some meat on their bones before you dive into a short story or novel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you write flash fiction and explore different characters, styles, techniques and genres, the more likely one of those pieces will naturally grow. If you set yourself a challenge to write X number of flash stories in X amount of time, the likelihood is one of those pieces will stick with you.&nbsp;When this happens, return to that story and write more flash pieces on it. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll have a new story with legs that will start to carry you towards a much higher word count.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re stuck in the middle of a novel draft or desperately trying to streamline the plot of your short story, sometimes the best thing to do is take a break. Try experimenting with flash fiction to either flesh out an element of your current story or write about something completely unrelated. This bite-sized form can work wonders for your creativity.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Sophie Campbell is a fiction writer and freelance creative copywriter and content writer.

You&#39;ve written a book, gone through several drafts, <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ebook-by-compiling-your-scrivener-project" target="_blank">compiled your Scrivener project</a>, and you&#39;re ready to self publish your book. This is a big accomplishment; you know how much creative work it took to get you to this point. There&#39;s just one more thing you need to do: create a cover for your book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener can produce a file that you can upload to ebook providers, such as Kindle Direct Publishing, Apple Books, Kobo, Barnes and Noble, and aggregators such as BookBaby and IngramSpark. Scrivener can also <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-front-and-back-matter-when-you-compile-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">include a cover when you compile this file</a> as part of the book&#39;s front matter. If you have the budget, a professional designer can help make the book cover that you really want. But if not, there are ways that you can create a cover yourself.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat should be on a book cover\r\n\r\n<p>A book cover really needs only two things: a title and an author&#39;s name. If a book is published by a publisher, their name should be on the cover, but if you&#39;re self-publishing a book, you don&#39;t need this. In some European countries, there is a tradition of minimalist book covers, where publishers use the same colors and fonts to show that books belong to that publisher&#39;s catalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you might want a minimalist book cover, with just text, most books need more than the basics to stand out in the self-publishing landscape. There should be an eye-catching composition, either through the fonts used or an image. If you use an image on the cover, it should give a hint about the book&#39;s content, and help situate it in its genre. Covers are often what attracts people first to a book, so it&#39;s important that yours has&nbsp;a cover that gets noticed.</p>\r\n\r\nGenre cover conventions\r\n\r\n<p>Certain genres have developed conventions for cover styles. For example, mysteries and thrillers often feature bold sans-serif fonts. If the author is well known, their name is at the top of the cover, usually larger than the title, and there are dark colors or photos for the background. Here are two examples of popular mysteries at the time of this writing, in November 2023.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/mystery-covers.png" alt="" width="600" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Romance novels often have serif cursive style fonts, and have brighter colors. They try to present a happy image, though not all romance novels are romcoms, and many use different types of design.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/romance-covers.png" alt="" width="600" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>The most popular novels in these and other genres use professional designs that separate them from the majority of other books. Since certain styles have become so common, this helps them stand out. But if you&#39;re self-publishing, it can be helpful to use covers similar to what is trending in your genre, so people can spot them in long lists of books.</p>\r\n\r\nHow to design a cover\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you&#39;re not a designer, there are easy ways to create a book cover. Many book covers use background images, and there are plenty of websites that offer stock images, like <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a>. These include images of places, objects, and people. You find a photo that you want to use, then pay to license the image. In some cases, you pay a single license for a royalty-free image (which means you can use it for multiple purposes, such as the book cover and marketing materials), but this may have limitations. It&#39;s also possible that someone else will use the same image for their book, or for another purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also rights-managed images, where you buy the rights to use an image exclusively, but may be limited as to how many copies of a book it can be used with, and for what purposes. If that is the case, you&#39;ll have to pay more if you sell a lot, or if you want to create assets for social media, print ads, and other uses. However, these images are exclusive, so you won&#39;t find another book using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have found an image, you still need to design the cover. You decide which fonts to use, in which colors and sizes, and how you crop the image. Services like <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> and <a href="https://www.coverjig.com" target="_blank">Coverjig</a> offer template-based services that make cover design easy. They include templates organized by genre, with a wide range of fonts and styles, and plenty of images you can use as well. Some of the templates on <a href="https://www.canva.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Canva are free, and others require a pro account</a>. <a href="https://www.coverjig.com/pricing" target="_blank">Coverjig charges per cover</a>, and has different tiers depending on whether you want to create marketing assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One important thing to consider when designing a cover is how readable it is in different sizes. People often see book covers on smartphones, where they are the size of postage stamps, if not smaller. Always design covers so they are readable at any size, and so they don&#39;t depend on small details that might not be visible when shrunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your skills are in writing a novel, not necessarily in designing a cover. But with the tools available today, you can make a professional-looking cover at a low cost.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

It sets the scene, introduces characters, and gives the reader a taste of what is to come. This is the most important part of a story, because it needs to hook the reader, to convince them to spend their time reading the rest of the story. Ideally, there is a hook at the very beginning of the opening, or at the end of the first chapter, to draw the reader in and make them want to turn pages.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/skier.png" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                The inciting incident\r\n\r\n<p>This&nbsp;marks the beginning of a story. In <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, this is when Ruth Wonderly comes into Sam Spade&#39;s office, claiming that she wants the detectives to find her missing sister. In <em>Breaking Bad</em>, the inciting incident occurs when Walter White receives a lung cancer diagnosis. In most murder mysteries, the inciting incident is when a body is found. And in romances, the inciting incident is often the <strong>meet cute,</strong> when the two main characters, who will hopefully fall in love, meet for the first time. Sometimes the inciting incident occurs on the very first page; sometimes it takes one or two chapters to occur.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Rising action&nbsp;or crises\r\n\r\n<p>This section forms&nbsp;the &#39;meat&#39; of a story, when the detective investigates a crime, when, in a romance novel, the main characters have their ups and downs, and, in an adventure story, this is when the hero is searching for the treasure. During this part of a story, readers discover more about the characters, and see them in conflict. The protagonist must resolve this conflict to move forward, trying to reach their goal, but there are hurdles that they must overcome. In <em>Thelma and Louise</em>, the rising action includes the attempted rape of Thelma, the murder of the rapist by Louise, Thelma&#39;s armed robbery of a store, and the characters&#39; attempt to reach Mexico. Each of these incidents shows the characters and their actions, as they confront problems and overcome them. During the rising action, characters are seen to change and grow.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                The climax\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the moment when the story reaches its paroxysm. The detective confronts the murderer, the couple get together, and treasure hunter finds the treasure. The climax can take place at the end of a crisis scene, when James Bond defeats the villain, and, in thrillers or adventure fiction, the climax is often a life-or-death scene. It can be catharsis, when a character understands that they need to change to grow and move on in their life. Or it can be revelation, such as in a mystery, when a killer is unmasked. In <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, the climax occurs when a wounded man stumbles into Sam Spade&#39;s office, and gives him a package, which turns out to be the falcon statute that others are looking for, allowing Sam Spade to work out how to deal with the people who killed his partner.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Falling action\r\n\r\n<p>This part takes place just after the climax, and leads up to the denouement. Things are slowing down, characters are catching their breath, plot threads are connecting, and characters are preparing for the next stage, the denouement. In <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, the falling action is the Hobbits&#39; journey back to the Shire, after the One Ring has been destroyed.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Resolution (and / or denouement)\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>denouement</strong>&nbsp;(French for untying) and <strong>resolution</strong>&nbsp;can be two separate events, or they can be combined. In a murder mystery, the denouement is when the detective finds the murderer; sometimes, this scene may also be a resolution, and we see what will happen to characters immediately following. In a romance, the denouement is often the first kiss, when two lovers find themselves, or when they find themselves again, after many vicissitudes. In many romances, there is no actual resolution: it&#39;s up to readers to imagine if the characters live happily ever after.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>resolution</strong>&nbsp;is sometimes what happens after the climax and denouement. We see how a protagonist has grown, or we feel their satisfaction at having achieved a goal. In <em>Romeo and Juliet,</em> after the denouement (the double suicide), the two families realize that their feud led to the death of their children, and they decide to end their disagreements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories don&#39;t always need a denouement and resolution. For example, in <em>Thelma and Louise</em>&nbsp;and <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>, there is no denouement or resolution. The endings of both these films are climaxes, and they end with the characters just about to die. In <em>Citizen Kane</em>, the climax occurs when we see Kane&#39;s childhood sled, bearing the word Rosebud, burning in a fire. There is no resolution for the journalist who had been seeking the truth about Charles Foster Kane.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many stories end with a cliffhanger, if they are episodes of a TV series, or films that invite sequels. In this case, there is a climax, and perhaps a denouement for the current story, but no resolution, as the future of the characters is left open for the next episode or the sequel.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/scrivener-story-structure1.png" alt="" width="75%" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Putting it into practice\r\n\r\n<p>When working in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank">Scrivener,</a> you can prepare your project to take these story structure elements into account.

You can go the traditional route and submit it to a publisher, or you can self-publish your book. The self-publishing process is fairly recent, and it allows authors to take full control of the life of their book, from writing to sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these processes, and the choice you make may affect not only the sales of one book, but also your potential career as an author.</p>\r\n\r\nTraditional publishing\r\n\r\n<p>Most authors are familiar with the traditional publishing process. You write a book, then seek out a potential literary agent or publisher. Most large publishers don&#39;t accept un-agented manuscripts, so getting an agent is essential. This means that there are two gatekeepers who will choose if your book is worthy of publication: first, an agent, who only earns money if they sell your book, will decide whether it is worth their time. Second, they have to convince a publisher to take the next step and actually publish the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once an agent has sold a book to a publisher, the production process begins. This includes developmental editing, which edits and makes suggestions for plot, character, style, pacing, and other large issues, though an agent may already have worked with an author on this. The publisher then moves on to line editing and copy editing, handles layout, cover design, and production, then prints books and generates ebooks. They then handle the distribution and sale of books to wholesalers and distributors, and, in some cases, work to promote books through ads, social media, book tours, and other means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All publishers list books on Amazon and other online retailers, but larger publishers have more weight on sell-in, getting bookstores to buy copies of books when they are first released. Larger publishers leverage their reputations to convince booksellers to champion new titles, while smaller publishers often have to rely on word of mouth to get books into retail stores. Larger publishers are also much more likely to place popular books in locations like airports and supermarkets, which can greatly improve sales of best sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main disadvantage of traditional publishing is that you give up control of your book. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing; having professional editors and designers can help improve your book and make it sell better. But there are many steps involved in the traditional publishing process, and you don&#39;t always have much say in how your book is handled. In addition, you generally have to wait about a year from the time your manuscript is accepted until it is published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don&#39;t forget the financial aspect. Literary agents generally take about a 15% commission, and, while royalties on sales vary, they generally don&#39;t exceed 10% for new authors. This doesn&#39;t mean that the publisher keeps 90% of the retail price; they sell the book to wholesalers at roughly 50% discount, and they bear the cost of producing, printing, and shipping finished books.</p>\r\n\r\nSelf-publishing\r\n\r\n<p>When you self-publish a book, you are in control of everything. This includes writing, editing, designing, and producing your book, as well as marketing it and getting it into bookstores. Most authors realize that their prose will not be perfect, so it can be advantageous to hire a professional editor to go over the book before it&#39;s finalized. Unless you&#39;re an artist, you should probably hire a cover designer as well. If you only plan to sell your book as an e-book, you don&#39;t need to worry about production, but if you do want printed copies, you can go through one of the many print-on-demand services to have books printed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since ebooks represent from 10 to 50% of fiction sales, depending on genre, most self-published books are published that way, and, if you write a book in a genre where ebooks sales are high, you may not even offer print books. You can <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ebook-by-compiling-your-scrivener-project" target="_blank">use Scrivener to easily produce ebooks from your manuscript</a>, and you can use a self-publishing platform like Amazon <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com" target="_blank">Kindle Direct Publishing</a> (KDP) or <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/plan-your-book/print/print-on-demand" target="_blank">Ingram Spark</a> to publish both ebooks and print-on-demand books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to being responsible for the production process, you are in charge of marketing your book. Hiring a publicist to assist with this is an additional expense, though many self-published authors promote their work through social media, online book clubs, and other channels. You can also try out different types of marketing, whereas traditional publishers tend to use marketing strategies they are familiar with. One thing that many self-published authors leverage is a mailing list, which they use to contact existing readers about new books they have published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you self-publish your books, you retain much more of the retail price, up to 70%, depending on the platform, and depending on whether you are selling print or ebooks. But these financial calculations need to take into account any costs you may have incurred to hire an editor, book designer, or publicist. You may end up earning as much from a self-published book as from the same book published traditionally, even if you sell far fewer copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when you self-publish, you are not just an author: you are also a business person. This means that you spend a fair amount of time on work that is not writing, and if that&#39;s not your thing, the traditional publishing route may be more appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\nHow to choose between traditional publishing and self-publishing\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, your decision comes down to several factors. Whether you want to spend the time producing and promoting a book, or whether you want to leverage the professional services of a publisher, and the potential that they have to help you build a more extensive career as an author. Whether you want to publish your book more quickly, versus the slower traditional publishing model. And whether you feel you can earn more from your book on your own or with a publisher who may be able to promote the book to channels that are harder for self-published authors to access.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

Television began nearly 100 years ago. &quot;In the middle of March 1925, a Scotsman called John Logie Baird takes this homespun apparatus to Selfridge&#39;s department store and does a fortnight of demonstrations in the electrical department, where he&#39;d been invited, with a piece of technology that could send really, really blurred, fuzzy images of geometrical shapes. I think it&#39;s legitimate to regard it as the origin moment of British television.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Television has made a great deal of progress over the years, from that simple eight-line display to HD and 4K television, but the production process hasn&#39;t changed much. &quot;The sophistication of the cameras that we use at Royal Shakespeare Company, the audio systems that we work with, the kind of definition, the quality of the image, the work that we can do in post-production, with the grading and all of that means, all of that is kind of unthinkable when you compare it to the early television. Technically,&nbsp;there&#39;s been a vast improvement in the system and profound change. But in some of the cultural forms and some of the ideas of language in some of the ways in which television speaks of what it is doing, there are really strong continuities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked John his opinion of the <em>Barbie</em> movie, which many media critics have dismissed. &quot;I think it&#39;s a masterpiece. I think it&#39;s an absolutely extraordinary achievement to make a film that effortlessly passes a billion dollars, within three weeks, that clearly appeals to and entertains a vast global audience,&nbsp;and yet is so complex and distinctive and interesting and challenging in terms of its politics of representation, its engagement with media theory, and its sophisticated argument about feminism, I think it&#39;s an absolutely brilliant achievement. It&#39;s also a complex piece of revolutionary pop propaganda.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John uses Scrivener for everything he writes: books, articles, and academic papers. &quot;It&#39;s completely my go-to writing tool. It&#39;s an absolutely essential piece of software. I use it for drafts, I use it for structuring and planning, and I use it to gather almost all of my research materials. So I will put a lot of PDFs, a lot of images, a lot of obviously a lot of notes that I take from books into a Scrivener project. And that&#39;s the way that I draft, write, and finish both books and journal articles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John stores lots of research in his Scrivener projects, information he has collected in a variety of locations. &quot;It&#39;s all available at the touch of a button as long as you&#39;ve got a subscription. So that&#39;s incredibly important. And pulling down PDFs of articles and loading them into the Research folder of Scrivener is really important, and equally, going through a lot of other academic books. Either taking photographs in the British Library or other libraries where one&#39;s able to take photographs of pages for your own research and load them into Scrivener. I really am an enthusiast, but one of the great things is being able to work with a horizontally split screen. In the lower screen, I&#39;ll have the text that I&#39;m typing, writing, compiling. And in the upper screen, I&#39;ll have a page of a PDF or a JPEG or whatever, which I can refer to, and that kind of really basic, comparative way of working is what I spend a great deal of my time doing. And it&#39;s a really good way of working.&quot;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

On the one hand, while writing, you need to focus on the content&mdash;worrying about formatting can be a distraction at this stage. On the other hand, formatting is important, whether you&rsquo;re self-publishing or submitting a manuscript to an editor, and putting it off until the end of the process can create more work later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we balance composition with presentation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to the relationship between the two, most writing apps fall into one of two categories: &ldquo;rich text&rdquo; and &ldquo;plain text&rdquo;. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Rich Text\r\n\r\n<p>Word processors such as Word use <i>rich text</i>: they give you complete control over all formatting right there in the editor. On the upside, this means your text looks great while you&rsquo;re writing and you know exactly how it will look on the page. On the downside, all that control requires a lot of UI: a ruler for tabs and indents, buttons for bold, italics, and alignment, menus for line spacing, and so on.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog-images/beta-testers-oct23/richtextword.png?border=1%2Cd5cfcd%2Coverlay" alt="Rich text in Microsoft Word."  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Rich text can also be somewhat inflexible if you need to share the text in different forms. While it might allow you to write using your favourite settings&mdash;blown up to 96-point Futura, say, or bold Comic Sans&mdash;all that formatting is baked into the text, so changing it later to something more suitable for your readers can be time-consuming;&nbsp;even more so if you need different formatting for, say, proof-reading and publishing.1</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Plain Text\r\n\r\n<p>In the opposite corner of the ring we find <i>plain text</i> editors that use Markdown. Plain text contains no formatting at all. This means fewer distractions while writing and, with no need of formatting buttons, allows for a more minimal interface. (This can be especially handy on mobile apps, where UI real estate is at a premium.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside is that you still need <i>some</i> way of telling the app how the final document should look, which is where Markdown comes in&mdash;you &ldquo;mark&rdquo; the text with symbols that act as placeholders for the formatting. To indicate a section of bold text, you wrap it in asterisks, **like this**; to indicate a block quote, you start each line with a &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;.2</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog-images/beta-testers-oct23/plaintextmarkdown.png?border=1%2Cd5cfcd%2Coverlay" alt="Markdown text."  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Aside from needing fewer buttons, the advantage of this approach is that the text isn&rsquo;t associated with any specific appearance (line spacing, font settings). Instead, users choose an appearance to be applied to the exported or printed document, and can often choose different appearances for different purposes (ebook, PDF, etc).3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach has plenty of adherents, but personally I find symbols in the text while I&rsquo;m writing more distracting than formatting buttons.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Cake Text?\r\n\r\n<p>Is there a way of having our cake and eating it? A text system that incorporates the advantages of both approaches? Rich text that still looks beautiful while writing, but without the necessity of so many buttons, with content mostly divorced from appearance, making it simple to switch between different sets of formatting?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to <i>reading</i>, this isn&rsquo;t uncommon: many e-readers, for example, are &ldquo;rich text&rdquo; in appearance (featuring bold text, indented quotes and so on) but let the user switch between various font and line spacing options that alter the presentation of the entire book on the fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This works because the text itself only knows that <i>this</i> paragraph is a title, <i>those</i> paragraphs are a quote, and <i>these</i> words are bold&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t know the formatting specifics. Those specifics are applied using a &ldquo;style sheet&rdquo;, which tells the text to, say, use a 12pt Sabon font with 1.2 line spacing, make titles bigger, and indent quotes. Switch to a different style sheet and the whole book looks different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think that with some tweaking, a similar approach could work beautifully for prose <i>writing</i> too, allowing for versatile formatting with fewer distractions. Which is why I set about coding a new text system based on these ideas. This was the starting point for our new app, which has been in the works now for nearly three years.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog-images/beta-testers-oct23/sidebyside.jpg?border=1%2Cd5cfcd%2Coverlay" alt="Different text appearances."  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                This Isn&rsquo;t Scrivener\r\n\r\n<p>With a more minimal text system came the opportunity for an app with a more minimal interface, something that could be much the same on desktop and mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked ourselves, would this be Scrivener 4? The answer was a resounding no. No one liked the idea of making Scrivener more minimal (except perhaps me, but only for selfish code maintenance reasons). That would mean tearing out features&mdash;and by what criteria?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created Scrivener around a fairly small set of features that I consider &ldquo;core&rdquo;. But from discussions among the team and from the 2020 user survey, we know that the features <i>users</i> consider &ldquo;core&rdquo; differ greatly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener has always been inclusive: its ability to handle so many different writing tasks and its vast array of tools are why so many users love it. It&rsquo;s why <i>we</i> love it. Making Scrivener more minimal wasn&rsquo;t an option. No one&rsquo;s favourite feature should have to face the chopping block, especially when there are no real alternatives out there that do all that Scrivener does. When we eventually start thinking about Scrivener 4, then, it should remain inclusive; our more minimal writing app would need to be something different.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Not Scrivener then: something new. But not <i>entirely</i> new. I&rsquo;d long been toying with the idea of an alternative, more minimal take on Scrivener. This was a chance to create an app pared back to hone in on the principles on which Scrivener was originally built:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	Work on a long text by splitting it into smaller sections.\r\n	Use an integrated outline for an overview and easy restructuring.\r\n	View research alongside writing.\r\n	Export or print with the option of changing the document&rsquo;s appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No corkboard, no scriptwriting mode, no distinction between titles and synopses, no collections, no multi-column outline, no custom metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, a pure concentration of writing and structure: an outline containing titles or descriptions tied to sections of text, a clean space to write, a place for notes, and an area to refer to research if you need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a laser-like focus keeps the UI light while still delivering a powerful writing experience tailored for long texts.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog-images/beta-testers-oct23/minimalapp.jpg" alt="Our new app."  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>So this isn&rsquo;t Scrivener; it contains only a fraction of Scrivener&rsquo;s features, and that fraction often works differently. It&rsquo;s a scalpel to Scrivener&rsquo;s Swiss army knife. And because it uses a different text system (and thus a different file format) and steers its own course, this isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;Scrivener Lite&rdquo;, either. It is its own thing. (Its own thing with iCloud sync.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who rely on Scrivener&rsquo;s deep feature set may find our new app too limiting, and that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;Scrivener will continue to be the powerhouse writing app it&#39;s always been. It&#39;s just being joined by a new member in our family of writing apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for those who use Scrivener mainly for the core principles above, or those who like the idea of Scrivener but find it too much for their needs&mdash;our new app might be right up your street.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                We Need You\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re now at the stage where we need to open up the macOS and iOS versions to a pool of testers. We&rsquo;re also looking for Windows testers to register interest for when the Windows beta is ready sometime in the first quarter of 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If any of the above strikes a chord, follow the link below to sign up for beta testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/beta_registration/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>Register to Become a Beta Tester</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Please note that this is a private beta, so if you&rsquo;re selected from the waiting list, you will be asked to keep quiet about the app until we say.

We&rsquo;ll have plenty more to say at some point next year, when beta testing nears completion and we can start thinking about the launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until then, happy writing&mdash;whether in Scrivener or in the beta of our new app.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \r\n<p>1&nbsp;Scrivener solves this problem by allowing formatting to be overridden when printing or exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2 Technically&nbsp;Markdown symbols are more about semantics than formatting, and double asterisks denote &ldquo;strong&rdquo; rather than bold, but this simplified description will suffice&nbsp;for our purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 Again, Scrivener&rsquo;s &ldquo;Compile&rdquo; feature achieves something similar by overriding formatting on export or print.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-25 14:00:00','Literature & a Latte blog','',NULL,'2023-12-02 02:47:03','read');

The narration of a novel is always told in a specific point of view: first person, second person, or third person. The same story told from a different point of view is a different story because the reader experiences it differently.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of points of view, and how to choose which one to use for a novel or short story.</p>\r\n\r\nThe three points of view\r\n\r\n<p>The three points of view in fiction correspond to the way we perceive the world. The story can be told through the eyes of I or we (the person telling the story, first person), you (second person), or them (third person). There can be variants for some of these points of view, but these are the three options available when writing fiction.</p>\r\n\r\nFirst person\r\n\r\n<p>First-person point of view is quite common. It brings a sense of intimacy and immediacy to a story. When the narrator tells a story using I, me, and we, it feels as though they are recounting the story directly to you, more so than second or third person. This point of view lets the reader experience the narrator&#39;s thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and is very useful in stories where character growth is a main focus. But there is a limit to first-person point of view: the reader only knows what the narrator knows, and only experiences what they experience. They are shut out from other characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, first-person point of view is very effective in certain genres. Mysteries, particularly hard-boiled mysteries, often use a first-person point of view to heighten suspense and to bring out the unique natures of the investigators who are conducting quests in this sort of novel. Linear stories like this tend to work well with this point of view. The narrator of a novel in first person may be the protagonist, but they don&#39;t have to be. For example, all the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels are told by his sidekick Dr. Watson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This point of view also allows the author to create an unreliable narrator. One example of this is the novel, <em>Gone Girl</em>, which features an interesting twist on the idea of first-person narrative. Other well-known novels told in first-person include <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, Marcel Proust&#39;s 3,000-page <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, and an interesting use of the first person is Stephen King&#39;s <em>From a Buick 8</em>, which is told in first person by multiple characters.</p>\r\n\r\nSecond person\r\n\r\n<p>The second-person point of view is relatively rare, and for good reason. Reading a book with the narrator saying &quot;you,&quot; can become tedious after a while. This approach is fairly common with gaming narratives or choose-your-own-adventure stories, but it is rare in standard fiction. There are exceptions, of course, one notably being <em>Bright Lights, Big City</em>, by Jay McInerney, which opens with the lines:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s no mean feat to pull off, writing an entire novel in the second person, but it can be an interesting experiment to try.</p>\r\n\r\nThird person\r\n\r\n<p>Third person is, by far, the most common point of view in fiction. It has the advantage of allowing writers to shape a story around one or more protagonists, but still remain distant enough to note what happens around the characters. Close or limited third-person point of view is when an author tells a story from the point of view of a single character, yet can also introduce things around them, such as the things they see, hear, and smell, giving more flexibility through description than would be the case in a first-person narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But third-person narrative is not limited to a single character. It is possible to change point-of-view characters in different chapters, even in different scenes, where each one is told in a limited third-person point of view. One example of this is the <em>Game of Thrones</em> cycle, where there are a dozen or more point-of-view characters in each novel. In stories with large scope, multiple point-of-view characters allow the story to be told across different times and different locations, though if there are too many point-of-view characters, it can be hard for the reader to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When writing a novel with multiple point-of-view characters in Scrivener, you can <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/5-tips-for-using-labels-in-scrivener" target="_blank">use labels for each chapter or scene according to the point-of-view characters</a>. Setting the Binder to show label colors allows you to easily spot which elements are told from which point of view, and this is also reflected in the Corkboard and Outliner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Omniscient third-person point of view takes the narrator to a birds-eye view where they know all of the characters and their thoughts, feelings, and actions. This was very common before the 20th century, but the narrator can seem detached. While they can swoop into the mind of any character, at any time, they tend not to focus on a single character enough for that character to necessarily feel alive. Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Leo Tolstoy used third-person omniscient narration, as did James Joyce in much of <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>\r\n\r\nWhich point of view to choose\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of fiction is written in third-person point of view, but first-person can be quite powerful. If you want to write a novel where the narrator has a distinctive voice, first-person is an excellent choice. Some genres are more adapted to first-person point of view: mysteries, thrillers, romance, young adult fiction, and others benefit from its immediacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be an interesting exercise to write several scenes or chapters from one point of view, and then rewrite them from a different point of view. If you&#39;re unsure which point of view to use for a novel, you might want to try this and see, which feels more comfortable.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

Not an easy task but an absolutely possible one.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="_kac9fqu763a2"></a>Why Take Part in NaNoWriMo?\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to finally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/stop-procrastinating-write">stop procrastinating and write</a>&nbsp;your novel, NaNoWriMo could be the dose of high intensity endurance training your creative brain needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While NaNoWriMo is designed for you to start and finish a novel around the length of books like&nbsp;<em>Sula</em>&nbsp;by Toni Morrison,&nbsp;<em>The Notebook</em>&nbsp;by Nicholas Sparks and&nbsp;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>&nbsp;by F. Scott Fitzgerald, writers use the challenge for a variety of writing goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could use the month of November to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">● plan a trilogy of&nbsp;epic fantasy novels, then write the first part</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">● finally finish a novel draft you&rsquo;ve been tinkering with for years</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36.0pt;">● produce the first draft of your memoir or nonfiction book</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can personalise NaNoWriMo to your specific goal, no matter what it is.

Whether you&rsquo;re a plotter (someone who maps out their story in detail before they start writing) or a pantser (someone who does little to no planning and flies by the seat of their pants), this will be a great help to your writing process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use Scrivener&#39;s <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo">extended trial and&nbsp;NaNoWriMo template</a> to collate your notes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-characters-in-scrivener">create character profiles</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/different-ways-of-setting-up-scriveners-binder-for-your-projects">use the Binder feature to plot out scenes, chapters or the whole novel</a>. Whether you like to flesh out all the details or simply have a loose outline, creating a clear path forward will give you a headstart when the writing challenge starts and hopefully save you from agonising over a blank page come November 1st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also use your prep time to plan your writing routine. Consider when, where and how you like to write. Think about the circumstances that allow you to be the most productive. If you have a full-time job and a stack of responsibilities, you might like to write first thing in the morning before the rest of your household wakes up. Or perhaps carving out an hour or two later in the evening will work best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re an early bird or a night owl, create a writing schedule to work around your life and be strict about sticking with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="_ujzn07g7az9d"></a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find a NaNoWriMo cheerleader to write with\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.writersdigest.com/be-inspired/how-to-avoid-lonely-writer-syndrome">writing can be lonely</a>. You can start off with the best intentions and lofty goals. But if you&rsquo;re working alone and not sharing your progress or challenges with anyone else, it&rsquo;s easier to talk yourself into giving up altogether when it gets difficult.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a> can fill writers with dread. It&rsquo;s a big, daunting task and nobody else can do the work for you. But you can find an abundance of encouragement, sustained motivation and support from another writer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an IRL friend also doing NaNoWriMo this year, make a plan to check in with each other regularly. You could even meet up with them in-person once a week to do writing sprints together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t personally know anyone embarking on the challenge, make an internet friend! Find someone in a NaNoWriMo group or online writing community and work with them to hold each other accountable. You can hold&nbsp;co-writing sessions over video calls, send each other voice notes on how each writing session is going, and talk each other through those crisis moments where the target seems impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="_arz302irobn"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the words into a numbers game\r\n\r\n<p>50,000 words in 30 days is a huge target to shoot for. And fixating on the big number may not set you up for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of looking up at the summit, focus on the steps in front of you. Spread over the full 30 days, the daily goal for NaNoWriMo is 1,667 words. Thinking only of the daily goal will help you break down the seemingly impossible task into small, manageable chunks. And when you finish each writing session and log it on your NaNoWriMo word counter, you&rsquo;ll get fresh motivation every day to keep going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know there are some days in November where you can&rsquo;t or simply don&rsquo;t want to write (birthdays, special events, weekend breaks, etc.), you can create a schedule that allows you to have some writing-free days throughout the month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some more strategies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those days where the words are flowing, allow yourself to go over your daily goal to give yourself a head start the next day. This will work in your favour on those days where writing feels like a slog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can easily write a few thousand words in one sitting and you want some breaks during NaNoWriMo, write 2,273 words per weekday and take the weekends off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However works best for you, find ways to segment the overarching goal into achievable baby steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, whether this is your first time taking part in NanoWriMo or you&rsquo;re a seasoned pro, tell yourself you can win. 51,670 writers did it in 2022. There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from being a winner this year and walking away with a full or partial first draft of your novel. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p><em>Sophie Campbell is a fiction writer and freelance creative copywriter and content writer.

At the most basic level, you need a situation, a problem, and a solution. A protagonist is in a certain situation, a problem arises, and they have to solve it. Novels require that a problem be solved, or that conflict be resolved. The protagonist, or hero/heroine, overcomes some difficulty to achieve a goal. (To be fair, experimental fiction exists without these elements.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, achieving a goal might not be enough for a good story. For a novel to be satisfying, the protagonist has to change, to grow, to learn from their experiences. They have to interact with other characters, sometimes an antagonist, and they have to make discoveries and have adventures. These adventures don&rsquo;t have to be the kind where they have to take a ring of power to a mountain to destroy it; an adventure in a romance novel can be a relationship, which may or may not work out.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Read our article <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/10-steps-to-get-started-with-scrivener-for-nanowrimo" target="_blank">10 Tips to Get Started with Scrivener for NanoWrimo</a>.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                The key elements of plot\r\n\r\n<p>A novel begins with a character in a situation. The character may be in stasis at the beginning of a novel, and what is needed for a story to begin is an inciting incident. This is the moment that a story begins. The inciting incident pulls the protagonist out of the status quo and plunges them into the world of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the inciting incident is in the first line of a novel, such as in Paul Auster&rsquo;s <em>City of Glass</em>, where the inciting incident occurs in the first sentence, and the author tells us so. &ldquo;It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.&rdquo; In <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, the inciting incident occurs on the first page, when Sam Spade&rsquo;s secretary, Effie Ferine, comes into his office and says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl wants to see you. Her name&rsquo;s Wonderly.&rdquo; In romance fiction, the inciting incident could be a meet-cute that occurs on the first page, or in the first chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a lot of setup is needed before the inciting incident. For some stories, there needs to be enough exposition so, when the inciting incident occurs, readers understand everything needed to make the story flow. In the first <em>Die Hard</em> movie, the inciting incident occurs about 23 minutes into the film (the entire runtime is 132 minutes). We see the main characters, John McClane and his wife, we learn about their estrangement, we see the Christmas party at the Nakatomi offices, and all of this builds up so, when Hans Gruber and his henchmen arrive, we&rsquo;re familiar with the layout of the building and many of the minor characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this point, the plot develops through a series of events, most of which contain exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Depending on the length of a novel, there can be one set of these events or many. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has dozens of events during this phase, but most novels only have a few. Thrillers tend to have many such elements, whereas some novels spread this section out more slowly, allowing there to be more time to discover characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, a novel leads to its crisis. This is the do-or-die moment (literally or figuratively), where the protagonist has to make decisions that lead to the resolution, or d&eacute;nouement, where plot threads are tied up, and the protagonist realizes what they have achieved, both externally and internally.</p>\r\n\r\nPreparing a plot in a Scrivener project\r\n\r\n<p>When preparing a Scrivener project for a plot structure, you can use the <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-folders-and-texts-to-power-up-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Binder</a>, <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">Outliner</a>, or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard" target="_blank">Corkboard</a>, or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner" target="_blank">combine all three</a>. You can plan ahead, as in this example using the Save the Cat story structure:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/save-the-cat.png" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>You can prepare each element of your plot, with the understanding that these may change, and you may add, remove, or rearrange the different sections as you progress. But if you are a planner, having your Binder set up in advance can help you move ahead more quickly as you write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, you may decide that you don&rsquo;t feel ready to write certain scenes of your novel. Since you&rsquo;ve already prepared the Binder for your overall structure, you can go ahead in the story and write a different scene, then come back when you&rsquo;re ready to the one you skipped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are doing NaNoWriMo, remember that the goal is not to write a finished novel in one month. What you do in November is write as much as you can, every day if possible, and try to attain 50,000 words. But you don&rsquo;t have to write from beginning to end, and Scrivener allows you to move around in your manuscript, according to what you want to write, and still have a solid plot structure serving as a skeleton for your novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And check out our recent episode of the <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/write-now-with-scrivener-episode-no-32-mary-robinette-kowal-science-fiction-and-fantasy-author" target="_blank">Write Now with Scrivener podcast</a>, where fantasy and science fiction author Mary Robinette Kowal talks about how she starts all her novels during NaNoWriMo, and <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/write-now-with-scrivener-episode-no-19-grant-faulkner-executive-director-of-nanowrimo" target="_blank">our episode where we interviewed Grant Faulkner, Executive Director of NaNoWriMo</a>.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

The idea arrives in their mind before they start writing or in the early stages of drafting. Like a eureka moment, they welcome the title with a strange familiarity. &#39;<em>There you are. Of course, it&rsquo;s you. Come on in and get settled.&#39;</em>&nbsp;But for most writers, titling their book leaves them lost for words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve changed the name of your book countless times since you started. Or you have a name that kind of works but doesn&rsquo;t put a fire in your belly. If the task has become agonising, here are some tips to help you find the words.</p>\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about your favourite books and their titles\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s books you&rsquo;ve enjoyed recently or old time favourites you reread over and over again, look at their titles. What made you pick them up from the shelf in a book shop even though countless other covers were trying to catch your eye? What titles do you love and why?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do your favourite titles include vivid imagery, emotion, clever wordplay or contradictory words that don&rsquo;t go together but somehow&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;go together? Look through the titles on your own bookshelves and in bookshops. Take a magnifying glass to what works and what falls flat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like you need to be a critical reader to be a great writer, think about titles critically to come up with a great name for your book.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/titlearticle.jpg" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                2. &nbsp; Brainstorm, brainstorm, brainstorm&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>Set aside a distraction and interruption-free block of time,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-daydreaming-can-enhance-creativity-for-fiction-writers">allow yourself to daydream</a>&nbsp;and free write a list of as many titles for your book as possible. Don&rsquo;t edit as you go or pause to cringe at what you just wrote. There will be terrible titles. But there will also be golden nuggets, one of which could become your final book title.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After brainstorming as many as you can, hide the list away. Leave it out of sight and out of mind for a few days or a week. Come back to the list with fresh eyes and start culling. Go through carefully and score out of the ones that are definite noes. What you should be left with is a list of maybes. At this stage, you can consider the remaining potential titles and tinker with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep shortening the list until you have a top 5. If you&rsquo;re still struggling to choose one, ask your friends, family and other writers which version they prefer best. From these focus group results, you could land on your perfect title.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="_463e0h3x08on"></a>\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research your genre and target readers\r\n\r\n<p>Having someone &ndash; a friend, beta reader, fellow writer or agent &ndash; say something negative about the name of your title might be hard to hear. A key part of finding the best fit for your book title is to consider your specific market, genre and audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a horror novel will have a much different style of title than a romance. The name of a collection of essays will vary greatly from a short story collection. A memoir will follow a different titling process compared to a sci-fi novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re stumped with what to name your book, do some digging into other titles in your genre and find out what grabs readers. We all know we shouldn&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover. But when your book is fighting for attention with agents, publishers and readers, your title needs to hook, intrigue and engage &ndash; fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name="_hcdmsz2xdbqs"></a>\r\n\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider literary devices and quirks\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of different ways you can approach naming your book. You could&nbsp;<a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/22-essential-literary-devices">employ literary devices</a>&nbsp;within your title like a metaphor, symbolism, paradox or alliteration. If you&rsquo;re struggling to figure out what style you want your title to have, here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to use your protagonist&#39;s name for your book title? Think&nbsp;<em>Olive Kitteridge</em>&nbsp;by Elizabeth Strout or&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>&nbsp;by Mary Shelley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a title that tells the reader something about the plot like&nbsp;<em>My Year of Rest and Relaxation</em>&nbsp;by Ottessa Moshfegh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you want to shock or perplex people with your title, creating intrigue to lure them in. Think&nbsp;<em>I&#39;m Glad My Mom Died&nbsp;</em>by Jennette McCurdy or&nbsp;<em>How the Dead Speak</em>&nbsp;By Val McDermid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a wordier title like&nbsp;<em>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine</em>&nbsp;by Gail Honeyman is more your style.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:36pt;">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do you want to add some specificity to your title with, for example, numbers? Think&nbsp;<em>Five Tuesdays in Winter</em>&nbsp;by Lily King or&nbsp;<em>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</em>&nbsp;by Taylor Jenkins Reid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crafting the perfect book title is more of an art than a science, like writing itself. So don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if settling on a name for your book is proving difficult. And if you&rsquo;re still in the early stages of writing your book, don&rsquo;t let yourself use &lsquo;untitled&rsquo; as an excuse to delay your writing process. The writing will show up if you do and so will the title.&nbsp;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Sophie Campbell is a fiction writer and freelance creative copywriter and content writer.

Many of these are very useful, but there&#39;s something special when you read a book about writing by a well-known writer whose work you appreciate. Some authors write books that talk about the tools and the trades of writing; others talk about the writing life. But all these authors have long experience filling pages with words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, I&#39;m going to look at four books on writing written by famous authors, and one bonus selection of interviews with great writers.</p>\r\n\r\nStephen King, On Writing\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best known books about writing is Stephen King&#39;s <a href="https://stephenking.com/works/nonfiction/on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft.html" target="_blank">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a>. Written in this best selling author&#39;s inhibitable style, this book is half memoir, half guide to being a better writer. First published in 2000, it is the first book that King published after he had a near-death experience. On, June 19, 1999 he was hit by a van when walking along a road near his home in Maine. (Stephen King fans will notice the numerological significance of this date.) He had started it a couple of years earlier, and used this book as a way to get back into writing as he healed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of On Writing is a memoir of King&#39;s experiences as he became a published writer. He talks about the frustrations of getting published, the excitement of selling his first novel <em>Carrie</em>, and his experiences with substance abuse. The second part of the book discusses the tools of writing: language, vocabulary, and grammar. He then goes on to talk about the art of writing. His most important advice is probably:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There&rsquo;s no way around these two things that I&rsquo;m aware of, no shortcut.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a book that spends a lot of time talking about plotting, dialogue, or the small details of writing. But it does give you a glimpse into the mind of one of America&#39;s most prolific and imaginative authors.</p>\r\n\r\nWalter Mosley, This Year You Write Your Novel\r\n\r\n<p>Author of dozens of novels of crime fiction, Walter Mosley is an astute teacher. His book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/walter-mosley/this-year-you-write-your-novel/9780316065498/" target="_blank">This Year You Write Your Novel</a> is written to motivate those people who want to write, and just can&#39;t get themselves to start writing. He begins by saying that this book is &quot;a guide for anyone who wishes to commit themselves to the task of beginning and completing a novel within a year&rsquo;s time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a short book, and doesn&#39;t go into the kind of detail that is common in toolbox books for writers, but is excellent as an overview for someone who wants to write a novel and doesn&#39;t know where to begin. There are no recipes, no structural outlines to follow, but rather tips about the basics of writing: narrative voice, character development, plot and structure, and more. As with the section on craft in King&#39;s book, this is more like an author chatting with you about the fundamentals of writing than a book of rules to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like King, Mosley points out that, &quot;The first thing you have to know about writing is that it is something you must do every day.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\nGeorge Saunders, A Swim in a Pond in the Rain\r\n\r\n<p>This book by George Saunders, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609280/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders/" target="_blank">A Swim in a Pond in the Rain</a>, is a discussion of short stories by Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Gogol, and is based on a course that Saunders has been teaching to university students for twenty years. This hefty tome reads like a university level discussion of literature, looks into the details of how stories work. Analyzing seven stories - all included in the book in English translation - Saunders discusses character, narrative, description, and the expectations we have when reading stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saunders says that &quot;For a young writer, reading the Russian stories of this period is akin to a young composer studying Bach,&quot; and, while many writers may never have read short stories by Russian authors of the 19th century, the principles presented through these stories are universal. This is less a book to motivate you writing and more a book that makes you dig deep into stories to look at the way writers create their worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He points out in the introduction that, &quot;A story is a linear-temporal phenomenon. It proceeds, and charms us (or doesn&rsquo;t), a line at a time. We have to keep being pulled into a story in order for it to do anything to us.&quot; And his goal is to show how you can keep readers reading, one line at a time.</p>\r\n\r\nMarguerite Duras, Writing\r\n\r\n<p>When she was in her late seventies, French author Marguerite Duras wrote a brief book called <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/writing" target="_blank">Writing</a>.\r\nIt is a stream of consciousness collection of essays, of fragments about writing and solitude. As an author of several dozen novels, and having lived a life full of adventure, Duras muses on what inspired her to write, and how writing requires that one be alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All writers know that writing a book is not something that is shared; it is a one-person process, and you spend months or years alone with your ideas. Many people, like Duras, find that &quot;Writing was the only thing that populated my life and made it magic. I did it. Writing never left me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duras writes about solitude, about how the death of a young English pilot inspired her writing, and talks of a painter at work. She shows how small events can be the germs of stories. This book won&#39;t tell you how to write, but it may help you understand the writer&#39;s life.</p>\r\n\r\nBonus selection: The Paris Review Book of Interviews, Vols. 1-4\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews" target="_blank">Paris Review</a> has long published interviews with authors, and four collections of these interviews are available in volumes around 500 pages each. <a href="https://canongate.co.uk/books/472-the-paris-review-interviews-vol-1/" target="_blank">The first volume</a> alone contains interviews with authors like Dorothy Parker, Ernest Hemingway, T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, Billy Wilder, and Joan Didion. Read these books to be inspired, and to learn about how great writers work.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

At the end of the show, a professional puppeteer came up to see me and I was like, wait a minute, someone will give you money to do this? And I basically changed career choices on the spot. I did that for about 20 years, mostly touring, and a little bit of film and television.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked if puppetry informs her writing, in the sense that she makes characters act. &quot;Absolutely. I have 20 years of working with an audience and seeing how they react to body language, character, all of that.&quot; She then talked about the four principles that bring a character to life, which are &quot;focus, breath, muscle and meaningful movement. Focus is what they notice, it&#39;s the same thing on the page, what your character notices and pays attention to, those are the things that indicate what they&#39;re thinking about. Breath is replicated by your punctuation. Writing developed to convey the spoken language, and punctuation is the way we encode our pauses. You can manipulate that, not only in the language of the character, but also in the language of the narration, to indicate something about the mood of the piece. Breath and rhythm are closely related. The longer a character lingers on something, the longer they&#39;re thinking about it, the more emotionally invested they are in it. And in writing, if I do narrative description, I look for the natural pauses in the flow of a scene to put that description.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked why Mary Robinette writes fantasy and science fiction. &quot;It&#39;s what I read. I love the way it takes the natural world and tips it on the side so you can kind of see the interstitial pieces. I like the way it invites the reader to have a conversation. Much like puppetry, science fiction and fantasy have metaphor built into it. I like that additional expressive freedom. And also like dragons and spaceships are cool.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Robinette has been using Scrivener for about a decade. &quot;When I started using it, I thought, this is going to be too complicated. So I took a novella that I needed to revise and put it into Scrivener, and then broke it into scenes as a way to ease myself into it. And now I compose directly in it. I use it for my outlining. I start using it from early in a project, as part of the brainstorming phase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Robinette has developed a process over these ten years, which leverages Scrivener&#39;s unique features. &quot;My basic process is that I do a single document where I come up with a synopsis. Then I break it apart into individual lines and use the [Split at Selection] feature to break those individual lines into individual files. Then I take those files, which is my general idea of what I think is the shape of the novel, and set them up in the&nbsp;Binder, using something like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmiqQ9NpPE&amp;list=PLzfRuHa21NIzQFrQ6FAq8Pj2IA_SXiwrN" target="_blank">Seven Point Story Structure</a>. Then I take that list of beats that happen in the novel and plug those into the appropriate spots, and then I look for holes. That allows me to think about the balance of the novel really early.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Robinette has started writing most of her novels during <a href="https://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>. &quot;I usually write the first two-thirds to three-quarters of a novel during NaNo. The pressure helps me, the community helps me. I do pre-planning. Before I get in, I come up with my outline, I have my tent posts, I do some exploratory free writing before I get in, so that I have a sense of voice. If it were my first NaNo, I would do that exploratory free writing as part of NaNo just to count for words. But I try to have a really good sense of what the project is so that when I start, I can go and I have momentum, and I don&#39;t have to stop to figure things out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked her for tips on what people should do to get ready for NaNoWriMo. &quot;One of the things that you should think about before you sit down to do NaNo is, why are you doing it? Are you doing it because you want to participate in the community, in which case, make sure you hop on to the forums and find out where meetups are. Are you doing it because you want to finish a book? If I&#39;m doing it to see if I can write 50,000 words, then I would think about what areas of craft I want to explore. I would say, okay, today I&#39;m just going to write that scene that I was planning, but I&#39;m going to really think about dialogue. And the next day, I&#39;d concentrate on description and just shorthand my dialogue. If it&#39;s not beautiful prose, I&#39;ll fix it later. But mostly, what I would say is just think about what is going to be joyful for you and then chase that. Marie Kondo your way through NaNoWriMo.&quot;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a &nbsp;<a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://glass.photo/mcelhearn" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-daydreaming-can-enhance-creativity-for-fiction-writers','How Daydreaming Can Enhance Creativity for Fiction Writers',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>I remember, back in second grade, my teacher chastising me because I was daydreaming. She rapped a ruler on my desk and told me to come back to the world. I don&#39;t recall what sort of thing I was thinking about at that young age. Fantasies about animals or monsters? Thoughts about getting let out of class to play? Or perhaps something related to a book I had been reading recently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the youngest age, at school, we&#39;re forced to pay attention, we&#39;re told not to daydream because it&#39;s bad. If you spend too much time staring out a window and daydreaming at work, you&#39;ll be reprimanded by your boss. Yet it has been shown that daydreaming can enhance creativity, and help us maintain good mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we daydream, our minds wander, letting seemingly random thoughts take over from the rigid goal-based ideas that we have most of the time. Daydreaming is defined as &quot;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/daydream" target="_blank">a pleasant visionary usually wishful creation of the imagination</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/daydream" target="_blank">a series of pleasant thoughts, usually about things that you would like to happen</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?scope=Entries&amp;q=daydream" target="_blank">A series of thoughts or yearnings that distract one&#39;s attention (esp. pleasantly) from the present</a>.&quot; Note the use of the word <em>pleasant</em> in all those definitions. Daydreaming is an enjoyable, satisfying event that takes us away from the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daydreaming is a door opened, just a bit, to the part of the brain that imagines and creates. And it&#39;s not hard to start daydreaming. Often, looking out a window allows us to make a break with reality. Instead of looking at our computers or our desks, we relax our eyes as they no longer focus on things close at hand, and allow our minds to also relax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many studies have shown that daydreaming can help enhance creativity and problem solving. When we daydream, our brains slip into a state where we don&#39;t need to accomplish anything, but where the mind can wander from thought to thought. As we follow these trains of thought in daydreams, the brain makes connections that we might miss when thinking intentionally. This is why we often come up with ideas when in the shower, <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/got-the-blank-page-blues-take-a-walk-how-walking-boosts-creativity" target="_blank">or when walking</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jerome L. Singer explains in his book <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Daydreaming_and_Fantasy_Psychology_Reviv/MU_XAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Daydreaming+and+fantasy+psychology+revivals+pdf+free&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">Daydreaming and Fantasy</a>, &quot;daydreaming represents a shift of attention <em>away</em> from some primary physical or mental task we have set for ourselves, or <em>away</em> from directly looking at or listening to something in the external environment, <em>toward</em> an unfolding sequence of private responses made to some internal stimulus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\nDaydreaming and writing fiction\r\n\r\n<p>When you write a novel, you make things up, you invent, you create worlds and characters and situations where they interact. You create a story out of thin air, out of your mind, your unconscious. The characters aren&#39;t real, the plot is made up, and the events of the story never happened. Yet when someone reads them, they can believe that they just might be real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href="https://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F" target="_blank">Where do you get your ideas?</a>, Neil Gaiman says, &quot;You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we&#39;re doing it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you work on a novel, daydreaming can help you create those worlds and characters, and open us up to ideas that we wouldn&#39;t discover when we try to solve problems. When you get stuck and don&#39;t know which way to go, when you don&#39;t know what your characters should do, take a break and daydream.</p>\r\n\r\nHow to daydream\r\n\r\n<p>It may seem like everyone knows how to daydream, but that may not be the case. We&#39;re so used to not daydreaming - because we&#39;re told not to at work and at school - that we may have lost the habit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest impediment to daydreaming is our smartphones. We used to have plenty of opportunities to daydream: on busses or trains, in waiting rooms, and when standing in line at banks. As <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n15/jenny-diski/on-the-beach" target="_blank">Jenny Diski has pointed out</a>, &quot;Travelling alone on a train was no longer a space to read or daydream, but a boredom hole to be filled with phone conversations.&quot; She wrote this before the advent of the smartphone, and that boredom hole is now filled with social media and games. Instead of taking out your phone when you have nothing to do, why not try to daydream instead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the classic ways to daydream is to look out a window. As <a href="https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/the-importance-of-staring-out-the-window/" target="_blank">a video from The School of Life</a> explains, &quot;The point of staring out of a window is, paradoxically, not to find out what is going on outside. It is, rather, an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds.&quot; If you have a window whose view is uncluttered, this can be helpful. But even if you are in a city, and your only view is other buildings, looking out a window with the intention to not look at anything can spur daydreaming. You could do this on a bus or train, just watching the world go by. (Get the window seat if you can.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember when you were a kid, you looked up in the sky and imagined what the clouds looked like? You can still do that as an adult. Clouds flowing slowly against a blue sky can help put you in a state of daydreaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could sit on a park bench or in nature, and look out at the plants and trees, but without paying too much attention to them. If you can&#39;t do that, lie in bed or on the floor, relax, and think of a beautiful place you have been to or you would like to visit. Or find a beautiful painting or photograph and look at it for a few minutes, then look out a window or lie down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any of these methods can help you slip into that state where your mind conjures up new ideas, often ideas that have been lurking in your subconscious. When you are writing fiction, many of these ideas may be related to your novel, and you can use these to move ahead and send your characters in new directions. Try daydreaming when you&#39;ve hit a wall in your writing; it could free you and open up new ideas.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-09-27 06:00:00','Literature & a Latte blog','',NULL,'2023-12-02 02:47:03','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/different-ways-of-setting-up-scriveners-binder-for-your-projects','Different Ways of Setting Up Scrivener’s Binder for Your Projects',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>While you do all of your writing in Scrivener&rsquo;s Editor, the Binder is where you organize your projects. The main advantages of Scrivener&rsquo;s Binder are the ability to move elements around as you develop a project, and the ability to quickly view any section or chapter; no scrolling required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can organize the Binder in several different ways, and the organization you choose for your project affects how you build it as you move ahead with your writing. In this article, I will look at several options to make the Binder work for you.</p>\r\n\r\nA brief overview of the Binder\r\n\r\n<p>The Binder is where Scrivener organizes all the elements of your project. It holds both texts that will be a part of your finished, compiled project, and other items, such as research, character and setting sketches, and notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top section of the Binder is where you organize your project&rsquo;s sections, chapters, and scenes. This organization begins in the Draft or Manuscript folder (in fiction templates) and develops from there. Sub-items are indented, and this shows the hierarchical organization of your project. We explain the basics of using the Binder in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-folders-and-texts-to-power-up-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Use Folders and Texts to Power Up the Scrivener Binder</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener&rsquo;s Binder lets you write your project in as granular a fashion as you want. You could use one file per chapter, or each chapter could contain a dozen files, each file being a scene or a part of a scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a relationship between the Binder, Outliner, and Corkboard. Everything you create in the Binder is also visible in these other views, and any changes you make to your project&rsquo;s organization in one of them is reflected in all three. This means that you can change your project&rsquo;s organization in the Outliner or Corkboard, if that is more appropriate to the way you think, then go back to the Binder and continue writing. See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner" target="_blank">Integrating Scrivener&rsquo;s Binder, Corkboard, and Outliner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are several ways you can organize the Binder.</p>\r\n\r\n1. Chapter folders and scenes\r\n\r\n<p>The first, and simplest, method of organizing Scrivener&rsquo;s Binder is to use chapter folders and scenes. You see this structure if you create a new project using the novel template.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org1.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>As you progress in your writing, add new files for additional scenes, and add new folders for chapters. For some writers, the scene file will be the entire text of a chapter. Others will break down their chapters into multiple scenes. The latter approach is especially useful if you are not sure where specific scenes will end up in your manuscript. It&rsquo;s easier to move them around that way, rather than cut them out of longer chapter files.</p>\r\n\r\n2. Part folders, chapter folders, and scenes\r\n\r\n<p>Another approach, if you divide your manuscript into parts or sections, is to use folders for each part, sub-folders for each chapter, and scenes within the chapter folders. You can drag and drop items in the Binder, and organize these as you wish.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org2.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Scenes are appropriate for fiction, but also for academic writing, where a chapter may contain several sub-sections.</p>\r\n\r\n3. Chapter files\r\n\r\n<p>Some people compose their manuscripts with just one file for each chapter. In this case, you may simply want to create multiple chapter files within the Manuscript or Draft folder; you don&rsquo;t need to have any other folders. This still allows you to move around individual chapters, if you wish to change the organization.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org3.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>You can always split chapter files if you want to move parts of them around. See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/merge-and-split-files-in-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Merge and Split Files in the Scrivener Binder</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n4. File groups\r\n\r\n<p>While folders and files are good visual reminders that correspond to the way you organize items on your computer, you can also organize your Binder in file groups. In Scrivener, a file can be a folder and a folder can be a file. This may seem counterintuitive, but you can drag a file onto another file to create a <em>file group</em>. You may want to structure your entire manuscript in file groups, or you may want to use them occasionally. For example, in a chapter with multiple scenes, you can group scenes by putting them in file groups. If you want to move all the scenes in that group, just move the file group, and if you just want to move one scene, you can move that individual file.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org4.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Or, you can use file groups within chapter folders, for scenes that are more complex, and that need to be broken down into their constituent parts. This is especially useful if you are writing a script, and have acts and scenes, and want to break the scenes down into smaller beats.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org5.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                5. Collections\r\n\r\n<p>Another way of organizing the Binder is to use collections. These are groups of files, which you create either by searching for specific terms or by adding files manually. Collections offer an alternate view of Binder elements, so you still need to use one of the above approaches to organize your manuscript. But collections are useful in specific cases when writing fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have multiple timelines in a story, with chapters and scenes throughout a novel that shift in the timeline, collections allow you to organize all the elements of each timeline to view them sequentially. The same is true if you write a novel with different point of view characters, which alternate as the story progresses. You can create collections for each character, so you can easily view all the chapters and scenes that are told from their point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the screenshot below, I&rsquo;ve created two collections for two point of view characters, Alice and Bob. You can drag any items from the Binder onto the collection names, then click a collection to see just those chapters or scenes.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/binder-org6.png" alt="" width="252" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>For more on using collections, see <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-scriveners-collections-to-access-groups-of-files-or-search-results-quickly" target="_blank">How to Use Scrivener&rsquo;s Collections to Access Groups of Files or Search Results Quickly</a></p>\r\n\r\nWhich Binder organization is right for your project?\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener is flexible enough to give you multiple options, and, in the end, it comes down to personal preference. You may want to have one file for each chapter, or you may want to break down your project into smaller parts. It&rsquo;s useful to be aware of the many options, so you can develop your projects in the way that works best for you.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

This is especially useful if you need to set off text in a block quote, or to create tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Header Bar tells you which document you&#39;re editing, lets you navigate forward and backwards, and has some tools to work with the editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s how to use the Format Bar and Ruler in Scrivener.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Three Bars\r\n\r\n<p>Above the Editor, the pane where you write text in Scrivener, are three bars.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/bars-format-bar-and-ruler.png" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \r\n	The <strong>Format Bar</strong> is at the top.\r\n	The <strong>Header Bar</strong>, surrounded by a green box, is in the middle.\r\n	The <strong>Ruler</strong> is at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All of these bars display by default, but you can hide each of them if you don&#39;t need them visible. Choose:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Hide Format Bar\r\n	View &gt; Editor Layout &gt; Hide Header View\r\n	View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Hide Ruler\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make them visible again, choose the same menu items, which now display Show instead of Hide.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Format Bar\r\n\r\n<p>The Format Bar gives you quick access to a number of formatting options. You can change the font, size, color, line spacing, and more of the text in your document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener supports styles; these are groups of formatting settings, which allow you to quickly format different elements of your documents. Click the leftmost dropdown menu, and you see these default styles:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/bars-style-menu.png" alt="" width="242" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>You can define your own styles, and it&#39;s a good idea to learn how to use styles; they can save a lot of time, and ensure consistency when formatting documents. For more on using styles in Scrivener, see <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/customize-the-scrivener-editor-3-use-styles-to-format-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">Customize the Scrivener Editor 3 - Use Styles to Format your Scrivener Projects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next three menus are easy to understand. The first lets you choose a font, the second the font variant (bold, italic, bold italic), and the third lets you choose the font size. To apply any of these settings, select the text you want to change, then click a menu and select your option. If you make changes when not selecting text, the options you select will apply from the point where your cursor is located. For example, if you&#39;ve finished a paragraph, and want the next paragraph to be bold, press Return, then choose Bold. The text will remain bold until you choose Regular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, you can set paragraph alignment here. Choose from left, center, right and justified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next section lets you choose text and highlight color. Each of these works a bit differently. If you want to change the color of text, select it, then right-click on the text color box and choose a color. To revert to black, click the text color box again. To highlight text, select text then click the highlight box. To change the highlight color, right click the highlight box and choose another color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can set line spacing with the next dropdown menu, and the final menu lets you choose from a number of list formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of these options are also available from Scrivener&#39;s menus, and many writers will choose to hide the Format Bar (View &gt; Text Editing &gt; Hide Format Bar) when writing. You can see that the Format menu contains most of the options you see on the Format Bar. If you&#39;re making a lot of changes, it can be more practicle to use the Format Bar. Also, note the many keyboard shortcuts available from the Format menu and its sub-menus.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/bars-format-menu.png" alt="" width="308" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>See chapter 15.7.2 of the Scrivener manual for more on using the Format Bar.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Header Bar\r\n\r\n<p>The most obvious element of the Header Bar is the name of the document you are currently viewing or editing. Here, I&#39;ve chosen an untitled document, before adding any text. You can name or rename a document by clicking the name in the Header Bar and typing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the left&nbsp;are &lt; back and &gt; forward buttons; these work like in a web browser, taking you back and ahead in documents you have viewed in your manuscript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the right, the &and; and &or; buttons let you view the documents above and below the current document in the Binder. These buttons are useful if you&#39;re checking or editing documents, and want to move sequentially ahead or back in your manuscript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The icon at the far right lets you split the Editor, so you can view two or four documents at the same time. Read <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/see-more-of-your-project-splitting-the-scrivener-editor" target="_blank">See More of Your Project: Splitting the Scrivener Editor</a> to learn how to split the Editor, use Copyholders, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, there&#39;s a lot more going on with the Header Bar. Chapter 8.1.1 of the Scrivener manual goes into more detail.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Ruler\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re familiar with word processors and text editors, you have probably used a ruler before. You use this to set margins, insert tabs, and set the indent or outdent for the first line of your paragraphs. As you can see, Scrivener has already set a number of tabs by default; they show as ▶︎ characters in the Ruler. Margins display as ▼ characters at the left and right of the ruler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These defaults display in Scrivener&#39;s settings. Choose Scrivener &gt; Settings &gt; Editor (Mac) or Scrivener &gt; Options &gt; Editor (Windows), then click Formatting.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/bars-formatting-options.png" alt="" width="767" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>If you want to make changes to the ruler, you can do so by selecting text in your document, then dragging the tabs, or clicking to add new ones. But there&#39;s an easier way to manage tabs: choose Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Tabs and Indents. The dialog that displays lets you define tab and indents using digits, so you can make them more even.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/bars-tabs-indents.png" alt="" width="362" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

One interesting thing about quantum physics is that some experts say that no one really understands it. Sean Carroll says, &quot;it&#39;s not that no one person understands it, but that no one person thinks that anyone else understands it. We don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics at a deep level yet. I don&#39;t want to give the wrong impression: we can use quantum mechanics extremely well, we can make predictions, we can verify them. We just don&#39;t agree on what&#39;s going on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pointed out that my cat Titus was irked by the many quantum physicists who like to put cats in boxes and either kill them or not kill them. (Referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat" target="_blank">Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s cat</a> thought experiment.) Sean said, &quot;my friend, Jim Hartle, who is a famous quantum physicist, had dinner with one of Erwin Schrodinger&#39;s daughters. His daughter said, &#39;I think my father just didn&#39;t like cats.&#39; When I present the thought experiment, I change it to one where the cat is in a superposition of being awake and being asleep. The physics setup is exactly the same, but you don&#39;t have to kill the cat, even if it&#39;s just a thought experiment cat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sean&#39;s book, <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/somethingdeeplyhidden/" target="_blank">Something Deeply Hidden</a>, he says that &quot;The enigma at the heart of quantum reality can be summed up in a simple motto: what we see when we look at the world seems to be fundamentally different from what actually <em>is</em>.&quot; I suggested that this suggests that quantum mechanics is also a form of philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Philosophy is certainly very helpful in trying to understand it,&quot; Sean said. &quot;I think that there&#39;s always a role for philosophy in certain kinds of scientific experiments or certain kinds of scientific inquiry. When we think about deep questions: how did the universe begin? What are space and time? Why is there a difference between the past and the future? What is quantum mechanics really telling us about reality? These are questions that are 100% scientific, but they&#39;re also 100% philosophical. So I think that the smart attitude here is to take the best of both approaches and see if we can make progress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean&#39;s latest book is - <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/biggestideas/" target="_blank">The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Vol. 1: Space, Time, and Motion</a>. One of the selling points for this book is that it contains equations in opposition to Stephen Hawking&#39;s famous book, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, which was advertised &quot;contains no equations, easy to read.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean said, &quot;The goal is to show you the real equations that physicists actually use and talk you through them, explain what all the symbols mean, explain what concepts they refer to, so that you can really understand at a literal level, not just a metaphorical level, what&#39;s going on with these ideas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean has been using Scrivener for a long time. &quot;I wrote my first ever popular book, <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/eternitytohere/" target="_blank">From Eternity to Here</a>, without Scrivener. And it was just a nightmare. Then I discovered Scrivener and my life has been completely changed. There&#39;s two things that I love. One is that I have one document with all my different files in it, all my different chapters, all my different notes. It&#39;s so easy - because I do this - to move around a chapter, to realize that chapter ten&nbsp;really should be chapter eight. A book, when you&#39;re writing it, is too large to fit in your brain all at once. There&#39;s just too much stuff. So you need that ability to switch things around. And the other thing, of course, is that my books involve research. So there&#39;s papers, there&#39;s figures, and I can store them there in the same Scrivener document, look at them without searching. When you write my kinds of books&nbsp;that are big and complicated and involve a lot of moving parts, Scrivener is absolutely a godsend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked Sean what he thinks of science fiction movies, especially those involving time travel, if the science is wrong. &quot;I don&#39;t mind people bending the laws of physics, I do mind them bending the laws of logic. I think that you should tell a good story. That&#39;s what I think is the primary goal of making a movie or writing a novel. And I also think that the best stories make sense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he said that he&#39;s ever thought of writing a novel. &quot;I would love to do it someday. I do have daydreams about it. I also have various nonfiction books I&#39;ve got to get out of the way first.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sean Carroll&nbsp;is Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy at&nbsp;<a href="https://jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>, and Fractal Faculty at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a>.</em></p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/working-with-images-in-scrivener-projects','Working with Images in Scrivener Projects',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>As a writing app, Scrivener is mainly designed to work with words, but many books and long documents also need to have images and graphics. You may want to use drawings to illustrate a novel or children&#39;s book; you may need to add images of tables or graphs to a thesis or dissertation; or you may want to include a map of your world at the beginning of a fantasy novel. Scrivener can manage these images, and include them in the final output when you compile your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s how to work with images in Scrivener projects.</p>\r\n\r\nAdding images to the Research folder\r\n\r\n<p>One of Scrivener&rsquo;s unique features is the <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-scriveners-research-folder-to-store-information-about-your-project" target="_blank">Research folder</a>, located in the Binder, and accessible at all times. This folder is where you place any documents that you use as source or reference material for your projects: text files, PDFs, images, videos, audio files, and more. When you want to add images to the Research folder, just drag them from your computer to that folder. To view an image in the Research folder, just click it, and Scrivener displays it in the Editor.</p>\r\n\r\nInserting images in a document\r\n\r\n<p>You can insert images in any document in your Scrivener project: text files, but also character and settings sketches. Just drag an image to the location in a file where you want to place it. You cannot add an image on its own to the Draft or Manuscript folder of the Binder; if you try this, you&#39;ll see the following dialogue:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/image-dialogue.png" alt="" width="372" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>In some cases, you may want to store an image in the Binder. For example, if you have a map that appears at the beginning of a novel, and want to be able to view it often, and have it included when you compile your manuscript, you can store it in a text file. To do this, create a new, blank document (Project &gt; New Text) then drag your image there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also add images by choosing Insert &gt; Image from File. This menu item is only available if your cursor is in a document. When you insert an image this way, it gets added at the location of the cursor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you add images to your Scrivener project, Scrivener copies the images. Once they are in the project, you can delete them from your computer, if you don&#39;t need to keep them there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to add images to your Scrivener project is to use linked images. To do this, choose Insert &gt; Image Linked to File. When you do this, Scrivener does not copy an image, but stores the path of the image file on your computer. There are two advantages to this. First, Scrivener creates a preview of the image, rather than copying what could be a large file. This is especially useful if you have high-resolution images, and want to prevent your projects from getting too large. The second benefit is that if you edit a linked image on your computer, Scrivener displays the updated version of that image. Scrivener updates image previews each time you launch your project, but you can force it to update an image by right-clicking an image, then choosing Reload from Original Image.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/image-reload.png" alt="" width="290" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>This menu also lets you open the image in an external editor - whichever app is the default editor for that image format - and convert the image to an embedded image (Mac only), if you decide you want to maintain it in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that when you use a linked image in your project, the image must be in the same location on your computer as it was when you added it, and have the same name as when you added it. If not, Scrivener will not be able to find the image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if you choose Insert &gt; Image Linked to Document, you can choose from images already in your project, either images you&#39;ve added to your Research folder, or images in web pages that you&#39;ve imported to the Research folder.</p>\r\n\r\nUsing images for ebook covers\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re planning to self publish an ebook, you will want to include a cover image in your project so it is added to the file when you compile. Put the cover graphic in the Front Matter folder in the Binder. When you compile, Scrivener uses the first graphic in that folder for your ebook&#39;s cover by default, but you can change which image is used in the Compile settings. For more on cover options for ebooks, see chapter 23.4.5 of the Scrivener manual. And see <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-front-and-back-matter-when-you-compile-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">How to Use Front and Back Matter when You Compile Your Scrivener Projects</a> to learn how to use front matter.</p>\r\n\r\nResizing images\r\n\r\n<p>When you add an image to your Scrivener project, the image displays at its original resolution.

In most cases, you want to leave Lock Aspect Ratio checked. This links the Horizontal and Vertical sliders, and the two Points fields, so if you change one, both change proportionally. Note that points are not pixels; Scrivener sets images to 300 DPI, which is ideal for professional printing, and this equates to 300 pixels per inch. A4 pages are 595 &times; 842 points, and Letter size pages are 612 &times; 792 points, and you can calculate the size to use for images based on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener&#39;s Editor is not WYSIWIG, and when you compile a project, much of the formatting and spacing may change. ￼It&rsquo;s a good idea to compile to PDF to check image sizes before finalizing your project.

Some talks were recorded on video, but mine wasn’t, and I thought at least some of this information was worth sharing with the world at large. These written notes are, of course, far from my exact words, but they are roughly my recollection of what I said, at the very least.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide02.jpeg" alt="Twine: Past, Present, Future: Chris Klimas"></p>\n<p>This talk is mostly about the present state of Twine and what I think about when I think about its future, both short- and long-term. I’ll talk a little about its origins just to set the stage and provide some context, but the history of Twine is really a talk unto itself.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide03.jpeg" alt="Or: the Twine State of the Union"></p>\n<p>In other words– this is a Twine State of the Union. We have a tradition in the United States where every year our president gives a speech on the state of the country, and of course they always say that the state of the union has never been stronger. So either the United States has never had a bad year, or maybe some of our presidents lie to us.</p>\n<p>So I have to say: the state of Twine has never been stronger.</p>\n<p>This is <em>a</em> state of the Twine union, not <em>the</em> state of the Twine union. This is my own point of view on Twine, which is of course incomplete.</p>\n<p>I’ll also do my best to keep to 45 minutes so that we have time to have a discussion about Twine. Believe it or not, I rarely get to talk to people who use Twine in person, and so this is a nice opportunity to do just that.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide04.jpeg" alt="Twine is 10 years old this year"></p>\n<p>By way of introduction, Twine is a decade old this year, which is a kind of milestone, especially for software, which often has a short life.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide05.jpeg" alt="Storyspace is 32 years old; Judy Malloy’s Narrabase is 33 years old; It has been 51 years since Douglas Englebart’s “mother of all demos”"></p>\n<p>That said, it exists in a broader context. Storyspace, the software that was used to create many hypertext works in the 90s, is now 32 years old. Judy Malloy, another early hypertext artist, has been working on her own system, Narrabase, since the 1980s. And Douglas Englebart’s “mother of all demos”, which was not where hypertext was invented but where it was introduced to a broader world, took place half a century ago now.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide06.jpeg" alt="The Past"></p>\n<p>So, let’s talk briefly about Twine’s past.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide07.jpeg" alt="I wrote several parser games (Mercy, Blue Chairs) but found myself frustrated by the conventions of the genre"></p>\n<p>I entered the IF world writing a few parser games, but I found that what I wanted to write didn’t mesh well with the conventions of that medium. This is nothing against parser as a medium, of course; it just wasn’t what I needed for then.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide08.jpeg" alt="I discovered TiddlyWiki and started experimenting with writing with it"></p>\n<p>I found a funny little piece of software, TiddlyWiki, which was a web page you could download and then edit directly in your web browser. It fascinated me as a piece of software because I didn’t think a web page sitting on your computer could do that. We’d now call this a security hole. But it’s funny, how so many interesting things come out of security holes, out of things that weren’t intended to be possible.</p>\n<p>Anway, I began writing hypertext stories with TiddlyWiki, though I don’t think I exactly thought of them as hypertext.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide09.jpeg" alt="I got frustrated with the UI and came up with a simple markup language for TiddlyWiki in 2006: Twee"></p>\n<p>At the same time, the process of writing in TiddlyWiki was cumbersome for me at times. It was a little like designing a labyrinth while you were inside it–easy to get lost. So I came up with a simple markup language that I could use to create TiddlyWiki files using a text editor, and I called it Twee.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide10.jpeg" alt="Twee was immediately not very popular"></p>\n<p>It didn’t take off really at all.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide11.jpeg" alt="I created a graphical version of Twee called Twine in 2009"></p>\n<p>So—fast forwarding quite a bit–I created a GUI to create stories of course called Twine three years later.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide12.jpeg" alt="Twine was immediately not very popular"></p>\n<p>Twine, too, didn’t take off– not at first.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide13.jpeg" alt="The indie game creator community, specifically Anna Anthropy, found Twine"></p>\n<p>It wasn’t until a community that I wasn’t even aware of at the time, the indie game community, adopted it, that it really took off. That too is a story in itself.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide14.jpeg" alt="In 2014, Twine 2, fully web-based, was released"></p>\n<p>And fast forwarding quite a bit again, five years after the first release of Twine, we migrated it to a fully web-based version called Twine 2. I decided this needed to happen because at that point, tablets had just been introduced and I thought that they might become the main way we compute, and I didn’t want to deal with app stores or other things. I saw moving Twine to the web as a way to work around those limitations.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide15.jpeg" alt="The Present"></p>\n<p>Which brings us to now…</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide16.jpeg" alt="Who uses Twine?"></p>\n<p>I first want to talk about who uses Twine.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide17.jpeg" alt="Twine 2.3.1 (released April 21) has been downloaded about 25,000 times"></p>\n<p>Twine 2.3.1 is not the most recent release --that happened Monday, five days before this presentation (which was June 10)-- but the second most recent release’s desktop app version has been downloaded around 25,000 times. That’s not 25,000 people; it just means that the software has been downloaded that many times. And this number doesn’t include people who use Twine on the web.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide18.jpeg" alt="Two pie charts comparing Twine usage against global OS usage"></p>\n<p>Breaking the desktop app downloads down by operating system, it roughly follows global statistics but with a larger Linux and Mac contingent.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide19.jpeg" alt="Twinery.org had about 50,000 distinct visitors in May 2019"></p>\n<p>On the web side, the official web site for Twine had about 50,000 people visit it in May.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide20.jpeg" alt="This link was clicked about 40,000 times in May 2019"></p>\n<p>And the link to work with Twine online has been clicked 40,000 times. That isn’t 40,000 people–that is 40,000 clicks—and it doesn’t include anyone who has bookmarked the web editor directly. We intentionally do not collect any analytics about what happens when people actually use the web version of Twine; it''s completely private.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide21.jpeg" alt="All these numbers can’t be directly compared, but what it does tell me is that the desktop app version is just as important as the web-based version, and they both seem to have dedicated audiences."></p>\n<p>All these numbers can’t be directly compared, but what it does tell me is that the desktop app version is just as important as the web-based version, and they both seem to have dedicated audiences.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide22.jpeg" alt="~ 3,000 members of the official Discord. ~ 2,300 subscribers to the unofficial subreddit"></p>\n<p>Another way to measure the size of the overall community is to look at the official Discord server, and the unofficial subreddit. Of course, these also are subsets of a much larger population.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide23.jpeg" alt="Anecdotally, there appear to be three major groups of people using Twine"></p>\n<p>Here we exit the part of the presentation based on actual evidence, and move into observations I’ve had online. Roughly speaking, there appear to be three major groups of people who use Twine.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide24.jpeg" alt="1. Creative professionals, mostly game designers, both as a prototyping tool and armature for narrative "></p>\n<p>A year ago I might have written game designers instead of creative professionals, but it seems that people use Twine to create more than just digital games. For these folks, Twine is a prototyping tool, to test out interactions or a narrative structure. It sometimes is a starting point, where what they create is added to to create a full experience. For example, the prologue to <em>Firewatch</em> began as a Twine game that the team created for internal use, to help flesh out the main character, and they liked it so much that it appears in the final game. It’s not Twine underneath in the actual game, I don’t think, however.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide25.jpeg" alt="Firewatch, Bandersnatch, To Be Or Not To Be"></p>\n<p>As I said, it’s more than just digital games being created with Twine– Charlie Brooker wrote the treatment for Bandersnatch using Twine, and Ryan North charted out a Choose Your Own Adventure flavored take on Romeo and Juliet with Twine that was published as a physical book.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide26.jpeg" alt="2. Educators, both in game design programs and out"></p>\n<p>The second group I see are educators, sometimes in game design programs, sometimes not. In game design programs, Twine is often used as a prototyping tool, or a way to introduce game design to students, in the same way that introductory courses have students designing board games. Outside of game design programs, Twine is sometimes used by teachers themselves, who design interactive activities for students to complete or experience, but more often it’s the students who are creating things with Twine, sometimes as a way to engage with computer science topics, sometimes as a way for them to demonstrate their knowledge of a topic—instead of writing a book report, they might create an interactive activity. When students are told they get to create a game, they often get very excited.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide27.jpeg" alt="A teacher showing young children Twine in a classroom"></p>\n<p>This is one of my favorite pictures related to Twine. It’s a classroom in India where the children are being taught to build a story with Twine. I like it not only because it reminds me of how far Twine’s reach has been, but also because Twine may be one of the first experiences that a child has with computing. It''s a big responsibility.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide28.jpeg" alt="3. Indie creators"></p>\n<p>The third group I see of Twine users are indie creators, who for me are the hardest to keep tabs on—they often live and communicate in very different spaces than me online and in real life. They’re cool and I’m not particularly. At the same time, often the most interesting and groundbreaking things are created by folks in this group.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide29.jpeg" alt="A screenshot from itch.io and a guide to the Whitney Biennial 2017"></p>\n<p>It really runs the gamut. On the left is a screenshot of the itch.io digital marketplace where I did a search for Twine games, and on the right is an exhibit listing for the Whitney Biennial two years ago, where some of Porpentine’s work was exhibited. It says something to me that Twine is appearing in spaces like art galleries, that it''s being recognized in spheres outside of digital games.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide30.jpeg" alt="What work is going on?"></p>\n<p>Moving from the people using Twine to the people developing it– what are we working on right now?</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide31.jpeg" alt="Twine adopted by the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation"></p>\n<p>Firstly, Twine has been adopted by the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org">IFTF</a>. What this means is not that the technical direction that Twine goes in is determined by IFTF. Instead, it means that IFTF provides technology and funding to Twine and its surrounding community. One example is, the main official site for Twine is now hosted by IFTF. Another concrete thing that has occurred due to IFTF’s involvement is that we now have monthly archive backups of <a href="http://philome.la/">Philome.la</a>, an immensely popular free site for hosting Twine stories that has tens of thousands of them hosted there. IFTF’s archives will ensure that these stories will be preserved for a long time.<img src="../images/Slide32.jpeg" alt="Twine committee: Leon Arnott, Dan Cox, M. C. DeMarco, Thomas Michael Edwards, David ‘Greyelf’ Tarrant,Chris Klimas, Colin Marc"></p>\n<p>IFTF has formed a Twine committee to manage and guide these efforts–I’ll talk about Leon and Thomas a bit later in this presentation. But by way of introduction of these members—</p>\n<p>Dan Cox has created hours of tutorial videos of how to use Twine. When people ask me what the best way to learn Twine is, I point them to Dan’s videos.</p>\n<p>M.C. DeMarco has been a mainstay of the community since nearly the beginning. She’s created several story formats for Twine, too.</p>\n<p>David ‘Greyelf’ Tarrant is also a venerable part of the Twine community. If you’ve ever asked a question on Twine’s Q&amp;A web site, he probably answered it. The site assigns points to people who provide answers marked as correct by the user posting the question–David’s score on this site is several times larger than my own.</p>\n<p>Finally, Colin Marc is the current maintainer of Philomela.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide33.jpeg" alt="Twine Cookbook"></p>\n<p>Two recent things that the committee has worked on: first, the <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook">Twine Cookbook</a>, which is a shameless ripoff of Inform’s recipe book. It covers topics that aren’t easily handled in reference documentation. For example, a question that gets asked a lot is how to build an RPG battle system inside of Twine. This isn’t a great fit for reference documentation, since it involves a couple different topics, but it is a good fit for the cookbook. The cookbook is now published at regular intervals.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide34.jpeg" alt="Twee specs now available for public comment"></p>\n<p>Secondly, the committe is working on <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs">a formal spec for Twee</a>, the text-based markup for Twine. I didn’t write one back when I first created Twee, and so there have been several compilers that all handle the basics correctly, but we haven’t so far been able to agree on a common way to extend what I originally came up with, which of course could be improved. The spec is an effort to get everyone on the same page. Right now it is open for public comment, and likely later this summer we’ll finalize it.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide35.jpeg" alt="Chapbook story format: Easier to write, mobile friendly, multimedia friendly"></p>\n<p>Outside of the committee, two major recent efforts have been made related to story formats. First, I’ve been spending a lot of time on <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook">Chapbook</a>, a new story format. People always ask– we already have three built-in formats, why do we need another one? A lot of Chapbook came out of my own experience teaching Twine. I found that in order to show people how to do certain things, especially related to multimedia, I had to bring in heavier-weight concepts than felt necessary. It also stemmed from my own experience writing Twine– I write longhand a lot, on paper. And so I adopted some of the shorthands I found intuitive on paper, too.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide36.jpeg" alt="Sample Chapbook code"></p>\n<p>Here’s a sample of Chapbook code, to give you an idea of what it looks like. Chapbook is currently on a beta 1 release; the goal is to release 1.0 in July.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide37.jpeg" alt=""></p>\n<p>Leon has also recently released <a href="https://twine2.neocities.org/#changes_3.0.0-changes">version 3.0 of Harlowe</a>, the default story format of Twine 2. I have this link to the release notes because there is no one major feature that has been added, in my opinion—it’s been a lot of small ones that add up in terms of the authoring experience.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide38.jpeg" alt="Who works on Twine?"></p>\n<p>So who is doing all this work?</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide39.jpeg" alt="&quot;they&quot;"></p>\n<p>I really wanted to include this section because one of the things I really hate is people assuming that Twine is developed by a single mysterious entity. ‘They’ changed my favorite feature, ‘they’ broke Twine. In reality, of course we are individual people. We disagree with each other, and we’re imperfect. But we’re people, not a ‘they.''</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide40.jpeg" alt="It’s hard to define a ‘core’ team"></p>\n<p>People often ask what the size of the “core” Twine team is, and it’s hard to define what that means. There are a lot of people who contribute to Twine through a single pull request, for example. For the purposes of today, I’ll talk about myself, and the two other people who work on the default story formats of Twine, the things that take over once you play your story in a browser. Neither of them unfortunately could be here today, but I asked them what they would like to share about themselves with the world.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide41.jpeg" alt="Leon Arnott: Creator and maintainer of Harlowe, the default story format for Twine 2"></p>\n<p>Leon created Harlowe, which is the default story format for Twine. If you’ve casually created a quick story with Twine on the web site, you probably have used his work.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide42.jpeg" alt="Leon Arnott: Lives in Australia, Builds web and Twine games, Interested in programming language design and preservation of digital games, Created macOS ports of popular GameMaker games"></p>\n<p>Leon lives in Australia, builds web and twine games, and is very interested in programming language design—which is very evident in Harlowe–and preservation of digital games. As part of that preservation effort, he’s ported several games to the Mac that were originally created in GameMaker, which is Windows-only– for example, the original Spelunky.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide43.jpeg" alt="Thomas Michael Edwards: Creator and maintainer of SugarCube, a very popular Twine story format, and Tweego, a CLI compiler for Twee"></p>\n<p>Thomas Michael Edwards created and maintains <a href="http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/">SugarCube</a>, a very popular story format that has been around for quite a long time too. He’s also the creator of <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/">Tweego</a>, a command-line compiler for Twee.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide44.jpeg" alt="Thomas Michael Edwards: Lives in Louisiana, A network/systems administrator and programmer who “has dabbled in web development since it became a thing (i.e. the early 90s)”"></p>\n<p>He’s a Lousiana-based network sysadmin and programmer who has done a fair bit of web development too.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide45.jpeg" alt="Chris Klimas: Creator and maintainer of Twine"></p>\n<p>Finally, myself.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide46.jpeg" alt="Chris Klimas: A Baltimore-based web developer, Board member of IFTF, Cofounder of an indie game studio, Unmapped Path, Teaches in Maryland Institute College of Art’s game design program"></p>\n<p>I live in Baltimore and work fulltime as a web developer. I’m on the board of the Interactive Fiction Foundation and am also a cofounder of a small indie game studio called <a href="https://unmappedpath.com">Unmapped Path</a> that creates Twine-based games. We’re going to be releasing our first game this year (we showed it in Narrascope’s demo room). And just this past spring, I began teaching at <a href="http://gamelab.mica.edu/">MICA’s game design program</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide47.jpeg" alt="We wear many hats; None of us work on Twine fulltime"></p>\n<p>So besides trying to humanize the team behind Twine a little bit, the other point I want to make is that Twine is not a fulltime job for any of us. We wear a lot of different hats, and Twine is just one of them.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide48.jpeg" alt="A short digression on the economics of open source; This is not a guilt trip"></p>\n<p>Which makes for a good jumping-off point for talking about the economics of open source. People always get a bit nervous when you bring up money, so I want to stress that this isn’t intended as a guilt trip. I’m not going to pass around a collection plate.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide49.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of my Patreon, showing I have raised $775 out of $2,500 per release, a goal I set for working on Twine fulltime"></p>\n<p>When I set up <a href="https://patreon.com/klembot">my Patreon</a>, one of the hardest thing was trying to come up with a dollar amount that, if I was able to bring in that much, I would go fulltime on Twine. I came up with this $2,500 figure that I’ll talk about in a moment, but you can see, I haven’t really come even close to meeting that number. It might sound a bit high…</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide50.jpeg" alt="A calculation showing $2500/release on Patreon equates to $23,000 annual salary"></p>\n<p>… but the thing about that $2,500 number is, if you assume I do a Twine-related release every month, that equates to an annual salary that’s a hair above minimum wage in the state in which I live, once you take out Patreon fees and self-employment tax.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide49.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of my Patreon, showing I have raised $775 out of $2,500 per release, a goal I set for working on Twine fulltime"></p>\n<p>But the other thing about that number is, I’m at $774 a release…</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide52.jpeg" alt="Chart showing how many people are making different monthly income ranges on Patreon"></p>\n<p>… but that is actually really good by Patreon standards. This chart is from last year, so bear that in mind, but the amount of money I’m currently raising is currently right at the start of that long tail, the last red block that equates to below minimum wage.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide53.jpeg" alt="This is not a guilt trip (really!), But how do we make this sustainable?"></p>\n<p>The point of talking about all this is not to make you feel guilty for not giving money to me, if you haven’t. Really!</p>\n<p>The point is, is it possible to make developing Twine sustainable…</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide54.jpeg" alt="This is not a guilt trip (really!), but how do we make this sustainable for not just me?"></p>\n<p>… not just for me, but for everyone working on it? Because Twine is not just me. There are so many other people who make it happen.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide55.jpeg" alt="The Future"></p>\n<p>Which brings us to the stage in this talk where I ask questions that I don’t know the answer to.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide56.jpeg" alt="The Twine development roadmap is on GitHub"></p>\n<p>But before I jump into those, I want to point out that the Twine development roadmap is on <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs">GitHub</a>. If you go into the <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/projects">Projects tab</a>, you can see what issues are going into the next release, and what progress has been made on them. If you look right now, there’s not that much to see, though– we just did a release and I need to lay out what’s coming next.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide57.jpeg" alt="… but there are some things not on that roadmap"></p>\n<p>That said, there are some things not on that roadmap.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide58.jpeg" alt="Becoming a signed app"></p>\n<p>First, Twine needs to become a signed app. Right now if you run the desktop app, especially on Windows, your computer will warn you that it’ll crash your computer, steal your data, and eat your children. The way around that is to code-sign the app. I don’t exactly know how this works yet on Windows, but on Macs it means paying Apple $100 a year to become a recognized developer.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this is an easy problem to solve. IFTF will be able to help with this.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean necessarily that Twine will appear in any app stores. I don’t know how much effort is involved with that yet.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide59.jpeg" alt="Adding a package manager"></p>\n<p>Secondly, Twine will hopefully soon gain a package manager. The problem that this solves is, if you want to extend Harlowe or SugarCube or anything else really, right now the most common way to do that is by copying and pasting code from someone else. This is problematic on a lot of different levels– a package manager allows things to work a lot more seamlessly, and in a more trustworthy way.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide60.jpeg" alt="Adding collaborative features"></p>\n<p>Finally, something I have wanted to add to Twine for a long time but haven’t been able to get to yet is adding collaborative features to Twine. Right now, collaborating with Twine is annoying. You have to trade files back and forth, and heaven help you if you end up making changes to an old file and have to figure out how to merge those changes back in. It ought to work more like Google Docs. You should be able to edit a story at the same time as multiple other people.</p>\n<p>Adding this not only takes development time, but it also may end up requiring support in terms of a back end server to manage this collaboration.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide61.jpeg" alt="Some things I think about:"></p>\n<p>I’ll close with some more questions I don’t know the answer to that I alluded to before.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide62.jpeg" alt="The future of the official Q&amp;A"></p>\n<p>First, a small thing. Our Q&amp;A site is full of spam and it has been for quite a long time. We’ve tried different technical approaches to solving the problem but none have been successful. What do we do with this site? It serves a real need in our user population, but it sucks up headspace from people who could otherwise be doing more interesting and valuable work.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide63.jpeg" alt="The future of the source code"></p>\n<p>Secondly, what do we want to do about the source code of Twine? It’s been suggested that its copyright should be owned by an organization, not a collection of people. But in order to make that happen, we have to track down all the people who have already contributed to Twine and get their permission. Everyone involved has to agree or it won’t work. We’d also need to create a CLA–a contributor’s license agreement.</p>\n<p>The thing I wonder about is, if we go to all this effort, will it be worth it when all is said and done?</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide64.jpeg" alt="How do we make decisions that reflect the entire Twine community?"></p>\n<p>(This wasn’t a slide I showed in the talk, because it was a thought that crystallized the morning of the talk. I said this at the talk, but didn’t have a slide to match it.)</p>\n<p>And finally, how do we make decisions that reflect the entire Twine community? A lot of development discussion happens on GitHub, but so many of our users don’t use GitHub and maybe don’t even know what GitHub is. How do we make decisions that don’t ignore their needs?</p>\n<p><img src="../images/Slide65.jpeg" alt="Let’s talk! hello at chrisklimas.com;klembot on Twitter; https://chrisklimas.com"></p>\n<p>(Here’s where my talk ended, and we indeed had some discussion with the audience. I won’t try to capture that here, but I will add that if you too have thoughts about these questions, feel free to reach out at the info listed above.)</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

In fact, I have a lot of news, so I''ll summarize everything first, then go point by point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have a new story format, Chapbook, that is in prerelease state.</li>\n<li>I’m going to involve Patreon backers in the Chapbook development process, and have added reward tiers and a goal.</li>\n<li>I am getting more transparent about my Twine development process.</li>\n<li>I am seeking someone (ideally, some people) to take over ownership of the Snowman story format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Told you it was a lot! Let''s start at the top.</p>\n<p><strong>I have a new story format, Chapbook, that is in prerelease state.</strong></p>\n<p>This is probably the most exciting bit of news to most of you reading this. I am pleased to announce <a href="https://github.com/klembot/chapbook">Chapbook</a>, which is a story format whose origins began in two separate, quite different projects: writing up a guide to Snowman, the story format I created for Twine 2, and collaborating on a Twine game.</p>\n<p>My Snowman guide idea was in theory noble: to teach people the rudiments of front-end development--HTML, JavaScript, and CSS--on the way to building stories in Snowman. I still think it would be an interesting book to write, but I quickly realized as I began to outline it: <em>this is way too much to learn just to write a story with some links</em>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I had been working with my creative partner Joel on a game we were creating with Snowman-- hopefully more about that soon. After much back-and-forth, the workflow we decided on was that he would pseudocode out the functionality he needed in each passage and I’d actually write the JavaScript to make it happen. As I was typing away, I thought: <em>why can’t we make the pseudocode actual code?</em></p>\n<p>I’ll let the rest of <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/guide/">the Chapbook guide</a>explain where I went to from there. I consider Chapbook to be in a state that you can at least build small stories with it. I have, for example, built out <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.html">a Cloak of Darkness example with Chapbook that you can play around</a>. But there is a lot left to be done, and many design decisions to make, which brings us to…</p>\n<p><strong>I’m going to involve Patreon backers in the Chapbook development process, and have added reward tiers and a goal.</strong></p>\n<p>I want to try an experiment with Chapbook. Right now, I am not accepting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests on Chapbook from the general public. When it reaches version 1.0, I will. Before then, I want to allow Patreon backers to collaborate with me on the shape it takes.</p>\n<p>What this means in practice is that I will begin postly weekly patron-only updates on Chapbook and Twine development, and I’ll use these posts as a way to gather feedback and suggestions as I work on Chapbook. If you pledge $5 or more per release, you’ll receive access to these posts, and have the ability to share your feedback there. I can’t promise that I’ll incorporate every idea, of course, but I will promise that I will read everything and do my best to respond in the comment thread.</p>\n<p>If you pledge $10 or more per release, I’ll also add your name to the Patron page of the Chapbook guide, and if you pledge $20 or more, I’ll also give you access to a monthly one-hour livestream. The livestream will be an experiment! I’d like to use the stream as a chance to talk about what I’m working on, talk about IF, and answer questions from patrons. I’ll even do my best to give advice on building stories with Twine! I really mean that it will be an experiment, because I’ve never tried anything like this before.</p>\n<p>Just as a reminder, my Patreon is based on releases, but I only charge patrons at most once a month. If I don’t do any work on Twine or Chapbook, I don’t charge patrons. And although I am building Patreon into my Chapbook development process, you can use Chapbook right now without having to be a Patreon backer, and you always will be able to.</p>\n<p>On a final Patreon note, I’ve added a goal: the amount of money pledged I’d need in order to work on Twine fulltime. The number I’ve come up with is also a bit experimental, to be honest. It represents how much I think it would take for my Patreon to become a primary source of income, though not my only one. I’ve been doing a lot of back-of-the-envelope math about my living expenses, and so in a lot of ways the goal is also a back-of-the-envelope number.</p>\n<p>But… even so, reaching that goal would be a life-changing moment for me. I hope that doesn’t sound too overdramatic, but I mean it. I love working on Twine and everything surrounding it, and I constantly wish that I had more time to do so. Reaching this goal would allow me to reorder my working time to better reflect what I want to do. And--if you want to be a bit selfish about it, it’d mean more regular Twine updates.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to…</p>\n<p><strong>I am getting more transparent about my Twine development process.</strong></p>\n<p>If you pop over to the <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs">Twine source code repository</a>and click on the Projects tab, you’ll see that I’ve laid out the roadmap for the next release of Twine, which will be 2.3.0. Right now everything is sitting in the To Do column; as I work on things, I’ll move them forward to In Progress, and finally Done. This way, everyone can get a sense of what’s on deck for the next version, and how close we are to a release.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning. I think as I get more experience with GitHub projects, I’m likely to add multiple projects, so that the roadmap goes further out than just the next release.</p>\n<p>Finally, a slightly sad note.</p>\n<p><strong>I am seeking someone (ideally, some people) to take over ownership of the Snowman story format.</strong></p>\n<p>I know I can’t maintain two story formats, so I am looking for people to take up the mantle of ownership of the Snowman format. If you’re interested in this, please <a href="http://chrisklimas.com/contact/">drop me a line</a>. Snowman as-is will remain an option for use in Twine, but I don''t have the time to devote to it right now.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

It was written in that shallowly friendly tone that customer-facing tech companies have nearly universally adopted as their style guide, that regardless of its actual content aims to disarm you. It took until I read <a href="http://www.filfre.net/2017/12/changes-to-the-patreon-billing-model/">Jimmy Maher''s explanation</a> that I saw what was afoot. It''s a one-two punch.</p>\n<p>First, patrons will pay the transaction fees for their pledges instead of the burden being shared between myself and Patreon. I can see arguments both for and against making this change. Personally, I always looked at the fees as the cost of doing business here. I certainly wasn''t losing sleep over them.</p>\n<p>Second, patrons will be charged fees on each individual pledge, not on every credit card charge. These fees no longer have a direct connection to payment processing fees.

Right now, I am considering my options carefully. I had actually been thinking of adding reward tiers to this Patreon, and had been brainstorming what those could be in the context of open-source development.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://chrisklimas.com/blog/2017-12-06-observations-on-mosaic','Observations on Mosaic',replace('<p>After trying out Steven Soderbergh''s interactive movie <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mosaic-from-steven-soderbergh/id1294357111?mt=8"><em>Mosaic</em></a>, I was surprised to find that there are very few reviews of it online, only puff pieces promoting it before it was released. So, some observations.</p>\n<p>First, although nearly every piece in the press describes it as in the vein of Choose Your Own Adventure, <em>Mosaic</em> is not a CYOA. It''s a movie that allows you to leap between points of view as you move through the story, with additional segments and background documents revealed as you progress. You can move backwards chronologically as much as you''d like, but you may only plod forward in time-- so as not to spoil the surprises of the story, I would guess.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at it: if <em>Mosaic</em> was a written work, we''d comfortably call it hypertext. I think the reason for the Choose Your Own Adventure comparison is that it''s the one thing the mainstream press understands is a form of narrative that requires reader participation to progress-- that isn''t a video game, anyhow. I suspect no one is brave enough to compare <em>Mosaic</em> to a video game to Soderbergh''s face.</p>\n<p>I don''t understand exactly why, but <em>Mosaic</em> is being released as both interactive app (on iOS) and linear TV series (on HBO). It seems extraordinarily challenging to design a narrative that will work in both contexts, and perhaps that''s why despite <em>Mosaic</em> holding my interest as I watched it, I came away a little disappointed. As I watched the final scenes (unlike many hypertexts, there really is a dénouement), I thought: &quot;I guess we are wrapping it up here?&quot;</p>\n<p>I believe I am paraphrasing someone, though I can''t exactly place who right now, when I write that the two main problems hypertext readers have to grapple with are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where am I in the story?</li>\n<li>Am I done reading?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So as a debut work of interactive narrative, it is not surprising that <em>Mosaic</em> ran headlong into problem #2. <em>Mosaic</em>''s ending is a bit <em>Chinatown</em>, so part of it was that I felt emotionally unsatisfied--but more than that, I wished that there was more <em>there</em> there. The digressions provide more explanation behind some of the actions of the characters, but they felt like browsing the appendices of a book, and not the cool kind of appendices. You also don''t have to do anything to unlock the extra video segments, so there isn''t much of a thrill of discovery. Maybe if <em>Mosaic</em> didn''t wrap up all the loose ends I saw, left some mystery for me to untangle, I would''ve found the extra material more engaging.</p>\n<p>The story itself? Interesting in parts, cliché in others. I found Joel''s segments the most interesting, but I hesitated a bit even there. He''s depicted as suffering from mental illness, and though I am far from an expert on these things, as I spent more time in his perspective it began to feel like a cartoony, larger-than-life version of mental illness. He also commits nearly every clichéd action a person in his position should never do. You''ll understand what I mean when you get there.</p>\n<p>I think the most daring part of <em>Mosaic</em> is that most video segments are 20 minutes or longer--which sounds like damning with faint praise, doesn''t it? But I think it worked. It gave me space to get comfortable and slip into a reflective state of mind instead of an active one (the kind you need to play, say-- a video game).</p>\n<p><em>Mosaic</em> also requires you to set up an account to experience it, but all it''s ever done with it is email me a few days after I finished the storyline to remind me, a little pedantically, that there was to more look at. I opened the app again, but nothing seemed different--it was just a stack of videos that would elaborate on, but not transform what I had already seen.</p>\n<p>p.s. It is always sort of funny to see James Ransone onscreen. He and I went to high school together--he was a friend-of-a-friend--so I have a strange, asymmetrical familiarity with his face.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

DeMarco</a> on Sunday to an issue with twinery.org. Namely, the home page was serving up malware in one of its JavaScript files-- the little script that shows the screenshots at full size when you select a thumbnail. That''s pretty bad. (To be honest, I am not sure of all the bad things that malware may have done. You can examine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721220759js_/http://twinery.org/js/lightbox.min.js">a copy of it on the Wayback Machine</a>. What I saw it do was, after I clicked a link on the home page, pop open an ad under my browser window.)</p>\n<p>After investigating things, a number of other things accelerated things from pretty bad to intensely bad:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Judging from the Wayback Machine, the twinery.org home page began serving malware sometime in July of this year.</li>\n<li>I could not determine exactly how the malware got on the site in the first place. My best guess currently is that I didn''t update one of the software packages on the site in a timely enough fashion and someone took advantage of that, but I don''t know for sure, and I don''t know how to be sure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The one silver lining was that the issue appeared to be contained to just the home page. The online Twine editor, in particular, was untouched. The downloadable versions of Twine 2 are hosted at Bitbucket.org, so those were not in any danger, and I''ve run virus scans on the Twine 1 installers hosted on the site, which have come up clean.</p>\n<p>I deleted the malware that same day, but given that <em>someone</em> had the ability to edit files at will on the web site for several months, stronger measures were called for. Conventional wisdom holds that the only way to be sure that there were no nasty surprises in store was to rebuild the server from trusted sources.</p>\n<p>This caused some plans I had been making to accelerate. For the past several months, I''ve been discussing the possibility of moving twinery.org to an Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation server with <a href="http://iftechfoundation.org/directors-advisory-board/">the rest of the IFTF board</a> (I am also a member). Up until now, the web site had been hosted on Dreamhost shared hosting. Dreamhost has been generally great--in particular, I am a fan of how easy they make it to enable Let''s Encrypt on a web site--but occasionally the site would go down for 15 minutes or so, and the best answer customer support could give me was that it was consuming too many resources and had been shut off temporarily.</p>\n<p>So, I reasoned, if I''m going to rebuild the server, I may as well do it once, not twice. Tonight, we switched twinery.org from Dreamhost to a server that IFTF operates.</p>\n<p>It has, unfortunately, not been a completely smooth transition. We weren''t yet prepared to migrate the active email addresses on twinery.org (I have a couple for administrative purposes). In order to make this kind of halfway change, I had to first turn off the Dreamhost site hosting, then point the domain name to the new server in Dreamhost''s control panel.</p>\n<p>The upshot of this is that for a while, you may see twinery.org displaying a cute Dreamhost robot that''s fallen over. Hopefully the change will propagate quickly, but if it hasn''t, your patience is appreciated. I wasn''t expecting this to happen--I thought the cutover would be seamless--but I hope this won''t cause too many problems for anyone.</p>\n<p>If you do see other issues with the web site, please drop a line to <a href="https://twitter.com/twinethreads">@twinethreads</a>.

If you eventually add some kind of mobile system for this, it would be almost needed to sync between devices. As is, I''d use it to work with others, and sync between my work and home computer. With the ability to sync in some way, you might be able to use the mobile platform instead of having a dedicated mobile version for iOS and Android.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One great weakness of Twine is that it has no real way to collaborate with other authors. When I originally created Twine as a desktop app, sharing a Twine story meant sharing the file through whatever means at hand-- email, a network share, Dropbox, what have-you.</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, this option remains in the Twine 2 era. But in the era of Google Docs and Office 365, expectations have changed. Not only do people not want to mess around with file sharing -- the expectation is that data lives in the cloud, which is to say &quot;someone else''s server&quot; -- but there''s also an expectation that multiple people should be able to edit simultaneously. These are not unfair expectations to have! In particular, the idea of simultaneous editing just makes sense. But they impose additional levels of complexity on an application.</p>\n<p>(It reminds me of the shift from modal, text-based applications to event-driven GUI apps. I am not old enough to have actually worked on an app back then, but I remember reading about this in programming books I devoured as a kid. In both cases, a fundamental change in perspective was required.)</p>\n<p>I decided very early on in the Twine 2 design process that I did not want to be responsible for storing stories on a server I controlled. I''ve seen other systems -- and continue to see new ones crop up -- that do this, and when this happens, authors become captive audiences of those who run the servers. Without some kind of financial means to keep the lights on, these services only exist so long as their maintainers have interest -- and in most cases, that can be measured in years, sometimes months. Imagine writing a story that just disappeared five years later! It would be a strange, even outrageous idea in the physical world. And yet we accept such ideas without much more than a sigh when they occur online.</p>\n<p>There were other concerns to running a centralized Twine server, too. I believe that as long as you house content, you share responsibility for it -- though this does not seem to be an attitude that everyone shares these days. I''m speaking here in moral terms, not really legal ones. I understand what safe harbor provisions are. Policing content for odious stuff like racism, pedophilia, and so on is not something I want to do. It''s a thankless but necessary job.</p>\n<p>I also looked into integrating with services like Dropbox, but in my limited exploration, I found that they expected you to have your own server backend that will talk to their services, not have clients speak directly to them. Twine 2 doesn''t have a backend. In this respect, it still resembles its TiddlyWiki parentage. An important cavest -- my understanding of this might be outdated. It''s been some time since I did that exploration.</p>\n<p>In short, I would very much like to work on a collaborative Twine server but I don''t have the time or resources to do so right now. And before I started working on it, I''d need a real plan for sustainability that I was confident in. It would only be fair to people using it.</p>\n<p>That said, I consider this subject an open question, not a sad conclusion.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

Initially, the test suite used a tool called Selenium that scripted actions in a web browser and verified the results. The problem with this approach is that it has turned out to be both brittle and flaky. Brittle because I would make a change to a small part of the code and 5 tests would break sometimes, and flaky because there were often difficult-to-debug timing issues with the tests that would cause them to succeed some of the time, and not others -- on the same code. Not ideal.</p>\n<p>(I know there are lots of happy users of Selenium, to which I say: good on you. But it hasn''t been good to me.)</p>\n<p>With the Twine 2.1 series, I''ve been focusing on unit testing, which isolates each part of the code and tests each bit of it individually. It''s been a lot more reliable thus far, but it takes time to write all the tests. I''ve been focusing unit tests on the data layer, because bugs that cause data corruption are the worst in the world. They trash users'' work and leave me feeling horribly guilty. I''m the dog that ate your homework.</p>\n<p>The bug that was in 2.1.2 didn''t have any testing associated with it. It was a sin of omission: if a grid spacing wasn''t specified when snapping passages to the grid, passages that are automatically created as you edit your story (e.g. when you type [[A link]]) would be assigned nonsense coordinates onscreen (NaN, if you speak JavaScript), which firstly caused them to not be displayed, and secondly could cause other passages to get their coordinates trashed, as Twine tries to keep passages from overlapping each other.</p>\n<p>(No, there isn''t any way for an end user to change grid spacing, because it''s always felt unnecessary to me... but it''s always good to leave ourselves that option should we want it someday.)</p>\n<p>Now the offending code has checks for grid spacing, and there is a specific test to check that it handles those situations correctly.

You can download it from <a href="https://twinery.org/">the main site</a> ; I''ve also posted <a href="http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:release_notes">release notes</a>  to the wiki. This release <em>should</em> fix a nasty bug affecting non-English speakers and also clean up some issues related to story format versions.</p>\n<p>The localization issue was particularly insidious. What was happening was:</p>\n<p>1. The app would do its initial startup and load in stories from the Twine/Stories directory, creating it if needed. This step would ask the localization code to translate the name &quot;Stories&quot;, but because localization data hadn''t been loaded yet, it would fall back to translating it to &quot;Stories&quot;, no matter what langauge you wanted to use.</p>\n<p>(The reason for this fallback is so that if something gets really messed up, you can still at least get some words on the screen, even if they''re in a language you don''t speak.)</p>\n<p>2. The rest of the app initialization would occur, including loading localization data.</p>\n<p>3. A user would make a change and Twine would try to save it to that Twine/Stories directory... only this time, it <em>would</em> translate the folder name. So if you speak French, for example, it would try to save to a nonexistent Twine/Histoires directory and fail.</p>\n<p>The solution was simple -- load the localization data as early as possible -- but it was tricky to diagnose.</p>\n<p>Looking at the release notes page tonight, I realized the last release was about three months ago. I think we''re on that pace, roughly, for future releases as well -- perhaps a little bit faster.</p>\n<p>I''m also working on Snowman 2.0 and am close to a release on that, which is exciting. It''s not too too different, but I am changing some syntax, most notably the way you create <div>s and <span>s (which is buggy in the 1.x series).</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since [the story format] Harlowe is the default [in Twine 2], I am using Harlowe and I understand that SugarCube [another story format bundled with Twine 2] is a bridge from Twine 1.x.  I have scoured the net for a description of the strengths of Harlowe and why it is now default, but I don''t seem to be able to find anything. The few comparisons of Harlowe and SugarCube seem to favor the latter -- though here and there are comments that Harlowe is more robust. I''m guessing (and hoping) that Harlowe will continue to develop and continue to be the default, but am I right in that? There seems to be a fair amount of resistance. Since I''m teaching Harlowe to others in hopes they will continue to use it, I''d be grateful for a quick insight. Right now I am under the vague impression that you and Mr. Arnott intend for Harlowe to be the standard from here on. Is that true and is there a quick reason why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A quick explanation: a story format is essentially a runtime engine for works built in Twine. It takes the passages created in Twine and displays them in a Web browser. I intended the name ''story format'' to a bit friendlier than ''engine,'' and formats in Twine 1 were indeed more about formatting than behavior. In Twine 2, the situation has become a bit more complex, and thus the term ''story format'' a bit dicier. Instead of choosing colors and whether clicking a link causes the story to expand or instead replace the existing text with new text, changing story formats in Twine 2 changes the entire approach an author takes to interactivity.</p>\n<p>There are three story formats bundled with Twine 2. People tend to think of Twine and its story formats as a monolithic development effort, but that isn''t the case -- each one is developed by different people on a volunteer basis. The formats are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/">SugarCube</a>, maintained by Thomas Michael Edwards. As Jeremiah alludes to, this is also available for Twine 1, is very mature, and has a ton of documentation, official and otherwise.</li>\n<li><a href="https://twine2.neocities.org/">Harlowe</a>, maintained by Leon Arnott. In my opinion, it''s a daring re-imagining of how to add interactivity to text that leverages a generous spoonful of functional programming. It''s a lot younger than SugarCube, which means that there isn''t as much documentation on how to do stuff with it.</li>\n<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2">Snowman</a>, maintained by me. It does the absolute minimum in terms of functionality, instead leaving that to the stalwart libraries <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>. It''s great if you already know JavaScript and CSS, or are interested in learning them. If you aren''t, it''s a terrible choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(By the way, anyone can create a story format for Twine, and adding one is as easy as copying and pasting a URL. I really enjoy <a href="http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/">Illume</a>, for example, when proofing work.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, Harlowe is the default story format in Twine 2. I decided to make it the default for Twine 2 not only because I had, and continue to have confidence in Leon''s skills and vision, but I also saw Twine 2 as a chance to re-examine the assumptions Twine 1 made.</p>\n<p>There are two things in particular that I think Harlowe gets right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It''s succinct and readable. I think Leon has worked out a very simple syntax for code that doesn''t interfere with the flow of reading passage text.</li>\n<li>It allows you to separate code from text. Harlowe allows you to mark a section of text as a &quot;hook&quot; which then can have code applied to it. This means that you can keep text and code compartmentalized -- which I find really handy, because the mindset I bring to writing and editing prose is vastly different from the one I bring to code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harlowe may be the default, but in my opinion, it''s not a standard. I say that because there is no standard. I realize this makes Twine a little bit confusing; a system like Undum has a distinct, singular look and feel. But right now, I think the compromise is worth it. SugarCube, Harlowe, and Snowman serve different audiences, which means that Twine as a whole can be useful to that many more people.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

It''s one of those gamebooks, like the <em>Fighting Fantasy</em> or the <em>Lone Wolf</em> series, where each passage is only about a paragraph long, so you''re constantly changing pages. Even reading on an iPad, where you can flip through pages rapidly, felt awkward.</p>\n<p>S. C. Cunningham, the author of <em>Colefax Manor</em>, does something a little bit odd with their book. Perhaps 80% of it, where you-the-protagonist explores a manor in the English countryside in the wake of a murder, is nearly static. There are characters -- suspects, I suppose -- who can be questioned but never move from their initial location or take any meaningful action at all. The butler is always polishing a bust in the library; the maid is always seated on a bed in the service hall; the gamekeeper is always napping in the stables. There are boxes you tick in your detective''s notebook that keep track of various clues you''ve found, similar to the approach the <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> gamebooks take, but they serve almost exclusively to unlock dialogue.</p>\n<p>It''s impossible, so far as I know, to make anyone confess. Instead, like the <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> board game, I think you''re meant to put together the means/motive/opportunity in your mind and then call back to headquarters with your solution, and you find out whether your case is strongly-supported.</p>\n<p>It feels a little like a thinly-implemented parser game, which in my opinion plays against the strengths of the gamebook genre. A gamebook will never be able to match the simulation possible in a parser game, so why not lean hard into plot and character?</p>\n<p>There is also a finale -- perhaps one could regard it as the Best Ending -- where you can take a more active role in resolving the murder mystery. It drops the investigative mood for more of a straight adventure feel, but it still feels parserlike -- the main decisions to make are avoiding instant-kill situations (which are adequately clued) and how long of a fuse to use on a bomb (the answer to which you can guess right now).</p>\n<p>Despite the shortcomings I found in it, I would recommend <em>Colefax Manor</em> to someone designing choice-based interactive fiction, particularly if they''re working in the gamebook genre. To me, it represents a particular school of thought of design; one I don''t agree with, but one that helped bring my own beliefs into sharper relief.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

In short, it''s a set of utilities that will help people who are a bit more technically savvy, or who are building larger stories.</p>\n<p>With it, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a single story from several story files, like StoryIncludes in Twine 1</li>\n<li>Write CSS and JavaScript outside Twine</li>\n<li>Add Twee code to a Twine story, or build stories entirely from Twee code</li>\n<li>Use Git or other source control systems in conjunction with Twine</li>\n<li>Build desktop app versions of Twine stories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started, visit <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/grunt-entwine-quickstart">the project page</a> and follow the instructions there.

Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twine-utils">twine-utils</a> instead and you''ll get a <em>entwine</em> command and associated Node module.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is the first public release, so there may be bugs lurking here. If you do run into problems, please add a bug report to the project page. There''s also room to grow here, too.

I have to remind myself how long it''s been, because it''s just a fact to me. I have a lot of difficulty imagining otherwise.</p>\n<p>We had always talked about building games, but it wasn''t until I found <a href="http://www.flixel.org/">Flixel</a>, which abstracted away all of the housekeeping and ceremony you''d normally need to get a game up and running, that we actually built them and released them to the world. There''s a symmetry there with my work on Twine, I think.</p>\n<p>We invented a studio name for ourselves, <a href="http://twofoldsecret.com/">Twofold Secret</a>, after much hand-wringing. We built a web site for ourselves and probably argued over the page design more than any actual work we did on the games. We released five games, all of which I''m very proud of-- even the early ones, with their warts. <em><a href="http://twofoldsecret.com/alight/">Alight</a></em> landed a sponsorship on Newgrounds homepage. When Flash''s popularity began to wane, we moved into downloadable games with <em><a href="http://twofoldsecret.com/sought/">Sought</a></em> and <a href="http://twofoldsecret.com/campkeepalive/"><em>Camp Keepalive</em></a>. We put on a gallery show that made the cover of the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bthesite/bs-b-0312-cover-indie-games-20140311-story.html"><em>Baltimore Sun</em>''s companion tabloid <em>b</em></a>.</p>\n<p>And then there was a space in our work. We tinkered with game concepts but never fell in love with one enough to fully follow through on it. We never gave up on the idea of building games -- just, we weren''t sure what to build next. We had both changed.</p>\n<p>It took some time to figure things out, but I think we have our bearings once again.</p>\n<p>We''ve decided to change our focus to be more squarely on interactive narrative, and our name to <a href="https://unmappedpath.com/">Unmapped Path</a>. Joel and I both have always thought of ourselves as writers, but our Twofold games belong to genres like <em>strategy game</em> and <em>platformer</em>. You can see our interests poke out of the dark clouds of <em>Alight</em> and the terminals of <em><a href="http://twofoldsecret.com/sanctuary17/">Sanctuary 17</a>__,</em> but someone giving them a quick glance would surely think <em>retro</em> before they thought <em>literary</em>.</p>\n<p>It''s time to let our writing play a larger role. We want to build games that engage more fully with storytelling, and we''re going to leverage our experience with Twine to do it. We''ve developed an in-house engine called Disbound (which, of course, has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/disbound">an etymology</a>) that makes building polished experiences for mobile and desktop with Twine extremely easy.</p>\n<p>The other reason why we''ve changed names is that we''re actively pursuing client work, and Twofold was more a garage band for us than a professional enterprise. Our first client project, <a href="http://asides.shakespearetheatre.org/undoothello/"><em>Undo Othello</em></a>, debuted in March. We built this for the Shakespeare Theater Company in nearby Washington DC, and it was a real pleasure working on it. I''ve always liked working in the nonprofit space, and especially the education space. I''m hopeful <em>Undo Othello</em> is just the beginning of our work there.</p>\n<p>We''re also working with Andrew Schneider to bring his game <a href="http://www.nockedthegame.com/"><em>Nocked! True Tales of Robin Hood</em></a> to iOS using Disbound. You can get a taste of the storyline by playing the version Andrew entered into the <a href="http://www.springthing.net/2016/play.html">Back Garden of this year''s Spring Thing interactive fiction festival</a>. I can promise, though -- the Spring Thing version is just a preview of what''s to come.</p>\n<p>And there is a third project Joel and I are working on ourselves that I can''t tell you about yet. There have to be some secrets for us to keep, right? If you''d like to know when we do announce it, <a href="https://twitter.com/unmappedpath">follow us on Twitter</a> or sign up for <a href="https://tinyletter.com/unmappedpath">our monthly newsletter</a>.

It will appear in print later this month, at which point I will gush with excitement all over again.</p>\n<p>I''m excited both that this is the first book I''ve ever tech edited, and that it''s the second book I know about that is specifically about Twine. (There''s <em><a href="http://amazon.com/Rise-Videogame-Zinesters-Drop-outs-Housewives-ebook/dp/B005K98PTO">Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</a></em> too, of course -- but while it talks a lot about Twine, I think the ambitions of the book extend past Twine, to a larger creative movement.)

I think that''s just right for a book about Twine, and for that matter, interactive fiction in general. I think it''s easy to fall into the trap of gee-whiz technical tricks without considering what story purposes they might serve. Melissa dodges that quite deftly.</p>\n<p>(By the way, the book also devotes many chapters to a gentle introduction to Harlowe, the default story format in Twine 2 -- so if you''re used to SugarCube but are curious what Harlowe''s all about, the book is a great way to try it.)</p>\n<p>Tech editing was more intimidating than I expected.

You should <a href="https://pacian.itch.io/superluminal-vagrant-twin">try it out</a>.</p>\n<p>What I especially liked, and I think distinguishes it from other, shorter Pacian games I''ve played (and would also recommend -- especially <a href="http://gamesforcrows.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/castle-of-red-prince.html">Castle of the Red Prince</a>), is the sense of depth to the world. Where Red Prince feels allusive, SVT is expository. For example, there are some characters who exist only to point the player to other locations to visit, from a mechanical point of view. And yet, the few sentences they''re given often give a sense not only of the politics and culture of the world, but also of the characters themselves. It''s pretty masterful to be able to do so much with so few words.</p>\n<p>It reminds me a little bit of how the exposition in <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a> is parceled out in bite-size morsels, though it doesn''t make as much sense in SVT. Shouldn''t the protagonist know at least most of their homeworlds? The &quot;Visited Worlds&quot; list only contains the one you''re standing on when you begin the game. But, this was the kind of quarrel I only thought of after I had finished -- I was willing to accept the artifice while I played.</p>\n<p>The only other criticism I have is that I felt the end arrived a little too abruptly. I had found one tool of what looked to be several that I''d need to reach the end, and then by pursuing a different thread, ended up bypassing the process completely. And I was actually looking forward to hunting for tools!</p>\n<p>I was OK with the limited parser vocabulary. It felt accommodating rather than restrictive, the same way it did in <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=2cuwjlvpybg8oaf0">Midnight. Swordfight.</a> The act of typing felt unnecessary, though, because there are so few verbs, and there are no hidden objects (so far that I found, anyway). I''ve played some of <a href="http://versificator.net/draculaland/">Draculaland</a> (warning: autoplays music), and it seems like this kind of verb-buttons-next-to-nouns interface would suit SVT well. But I also understand that the tooling to create those interfaces isn''t quite as mature as Inform. It struck me as a practical choice, to privilege narrative and mechanics over interface in development time.</p>\n<p>(By the way, I named my spaceship <em>The Zoombeast,</em> in case you''re shopping for a spaceship for me and are wondering what to christen it_._ Another grace note in the game is when the moment you get to name your ship occurs-- not right at the start, as is typical for roguelikes, but in the mid-game, after you''ve had time to build a mental picture of it through gameplay.)</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

If you notice a bug, please <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/issues">report it</a>!</p>\n<p>I''ll write a little bit about why there''s been a longer gap between this release than there typically has been, because I think it''s a useful cautionary tale. Over 2015, I was proud to hit a release about every month and a half. The slowdown was basically a case of pulling one thread in the codebase and all kinds of thing untangling.</p>\n<p>I had some free time around the holidays, so I decided to try using a CSS preprocessor for the code, and also to try to improve the code structure. That is to say, to try to pay down some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>. What ended up happening was that using a preprocessor triggered a general rethink of the Twine UI, to try to make it more consistent, and improving the code structure led me down the road to major refactoring, which also implies major retesting. Both these things took up the time I had charted out in my head, and went well beyond. It was clear to me that getting this branch of the source tree (which I had named, with increasing dismay, refactor-2k15) in shape that it could be merged back into the main line of development would take a long time, much longer than I (and many other contributors to the code) was comfortable with.</p>\n<p>So I''m taking a different tack now, prompted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF58ZJ1ZQxY">a talk by Ryan Florence called &quot;Don''t Refactor, React&quot;</a> that <a href="http://www.aimeemarieknight.com/">Aimee Knight</a> was kind enough to point me to. It''s well worth a watch if you''re trying to grapple with the dizzying carousel that is JavaScript development these days. (No, this does not mean I''m rewriting Twine in React -- though who knows what the future may bring, I guess? Right now I am finding I prefer Vue over React, for what it is worth, though this opinion is not informed by a lot of experience yet.)</p>\n<p>The point of the talk being, instead of refactoring from all the way at the top, start simply, and at the lowest level. Succeed early, and use momentum to your advantage.</p>\n<p>What this means in practice is that once 2.0.11 is out the door, I''m going to try to move over the changes from that ill-fated refactor-2k15 branch over in small, incremental steps. My hunch is that this will work a lot better. Here''s hoping!</p>\n<p>p.s. I''ve attached a screenshot of the revised UI, by the way. As you can see, it''s not radically different -- hopefully just refreshing. There''s a whole other post to be written about how I got there.</p>\n<p><a href="http://chrisklimas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2015-12-13-at-8.16.29-PM.png"><img src="../images/Screen-Shot-2015-12-13-at-8.16.29-PM-300x164.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-13 at 8.16.29 PM"></a></p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

So, there''s no point in charging for a GPL-licensed application, since anyone who ponies up whatever cash is allowed to then give it away to the entire world for free.</p>\n<p>Before I move on, I''ll also point out that works you create with Twine are <em>not</em> governed by the GPL. The story formats that your work is bound to -- Harlowe, Sugarcube, and Snowman -- have <a href="https://bitbucket.org/_L_/harlowe/src/55089892a489d05b98b32975e770b1154a750bcc/LICENSE?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default">more</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tmedwards/sugarcube/src/1c9389e113fb59228e009b81ad7c896639b213e6/LICENSE?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default">permissive</a> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2/src/a4b53ec81328baaf21607739920d00f0a1778bf9/LICENSE?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default">licenses</a> that largely only require you to credit them appropriately.</p>\n<p>That said, there''s something here that I especially don''t want to discourage, which is people asking for donations to expand Twine''s capabilities. It would be hypocritical to do otherwise, considering <a href="https://www.patreon.com/klembot">I''ve set up a Patreon to do exactly that</a>. Again, the GPL places limitations on this. If you create a derivative version of Twine, it must also be released under the GPL -- and ideally, you would contribute those changes to the main source repository. You are not permitted to take Twine, change it, and then offer it under a different license (in particular, a proprietary one).</p>\n<p>Obviously, you should use the same judgment that is appropriate when evaluating any crowdfunding campaign. I don''t know the person running the crowdfunding campaign nor have I spoken with them, as I mentioned above, so I can''t really speak to its viability. You''ll have to draw your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>I''ll close with why I haven''t put Twine in app stores like Steam, itch, the Mac App Store, and so on thus far. Right now, I have my hands full supporting mobile browsers and all three major desktop OSes -- producing separate versions for the various stores, let alone supporting them, is too much for me to consider right now. Though that may change in the future-- who knows?</p>\n<p>Speaking of, I''m looking for someone to assist with managing the Linux version of Twine. There were a number of Linux-specific bugs that made it into 2.0.10 because we didn''t test on that platform as much as we did Windows and OS X. If you''re interested, please <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Edited on 20 December 2015 to clarify that changes to Twine must remain under the GPL, as specified by the terms of the GPLv3.</em></p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

(Some people ran into permissions problems.)</li>\n<li>Corrects a problem where the desktop apps would complain incorrectly about the size of your story.</li>\n<li>A display glitch where you''d sometimes see two scroll bars in the passage editor has been fixed.</li>\n<li>Global variables no longer leak into test versions of stories. This you probably only noticed if you are a web developer kind of person -- what would happen is that certain libraries, like <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, would be available in test versions of stories but not the published ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the hood, the changes are bigger.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We now use Browserify to break up the code into more manageable modules.</li>\n<li>The Selenium IDE tests have been migrated to JavaScript, and make use of the Mocha test framework, so they''re easier to run.</li>\n<li>Switched from jslint to eslint.</li>\n<li>Switched from YUIDoc to JSDoc 3.</li>\n<li>Returned to Grunt for the build process after a flirtation with Gulp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are pretty big changes, and I''ll probably devote some words to why I made some of those decisions in the future.

We have three new languages that have already landed on the main development sourcebase: French, Dutch, and Brazilian Portuguese. There''s also a pull request for Russian that I''m excited about getting landed. I think there''s a sizeable interactive fiction community that speaks Russian, so it''ll be cool to give them something that works in their native language.</p>\n<p>The other big change I want to land is totally under the covers. After talking with some fellow developers at the <a href="http://charmcityjs.com/">CharmCityJS meetup</a> and getting advice on the workflow I''ve set up for myself, I''ve been working on refactoring the code structure a bit so that we use <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> to split the code up into more manageable modules. If I do this right, regular users won''t see any difference, but it will be way easier to work on the code. This not only makes my life easier, but will also make it easier for other developers to contribute to the other project. As of August, the work on this end is pretty much done, but I am waiting on the next part to land those changes...</p>\n<p>... which is that I''m overhauling the automated tests for Twine. Up until now, I''d been using <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a> to exercise Twine before release. It''s a Firefox plugin that automates browser actions and verifies they have the result you''d expect. Working with Selenium IDE has always been OK at best. I could never get a few tests to work predictably, so every time I did a release, I had to manually step through a few to make sure things would work correctly. This kind of friction always annoyed me, but I put up with it because it was the best way I knew how to do it.</p>\n<p>So, also at the suggestion of fellow CharmCityJS''ers, I''ve been working on moving the Selenium tests out of the IDE and into the build process I''ve been using, Gulp. This has the advantage of being more convenient to run -- a single command instead of having to navigate a GUI -- but also promises more reliability. We shall see. The JavaScript bindings for Selenium are pretty full-featured, but it''s taking me some time to translate the IDE tests into JS because the best documentation I''ve been able to find is the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/index.html">API docs</a>. It is a bit like trying to learn a language by skimming through a dictionary. Suggestions welcome!</p>\n<p>My theory is that I''ll use the revised browser tests to validate the code re-organization. A major refactor is always a little perilous. Perhaps your code was ugly, but it had been working right for several releases. The automated tests are a way to better guarantee that.</p>\n<p>That said, I''m still planning to do a prerelease test version to the world at large to catch anything that slips through the cracks. This release has been a bit slower to get out the door than others this year, mainly because I''m doing a lot of learning along the way. That said, I''m shooting for mid-September.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

The releases since then have all been what you''d call patch versions in the <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> universe -- hence we''re are 2.0.8, not 2.8. So once 2.0.9 is out the door, the question is: where to next?</p>\n<p>We certainly have <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/issues?kind=enhancement">a ton of feature enhancements</a> to consider. Right now I see a couple major things that need addressing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have no nice way for people to include multimedia in Twine stories. You can do it by pasting in Base64-encoded data into your passages, but this is a horrible user experience. I think about WordPress as an aspiration goal for the UI for this, but I''m curious if there are other models people would suggest looking at.</li>\n<li>We need better ways for story formats to augment Twine so that it can better understand links. For example. It would be nice if a passage whose macros reference another one had a line between them in the story map. I have a spec for how to do this in draft form, which also includes other kinds of hooks for story formats. This doesn''t have a huge benefit to users right away, but it will make life a lot better for story format authors.</li>\n<li>We need a better way to manage story map complexity. I''ve toyed with a lot of different ways to slice up a Twine story -- for example, splitting it out into tabs that you can swap between (though I''m not overly fond of that approach, because it''s not spatial in the same way that the rest of Twine is). I feel like prototypes will be needed in order to decide what the best course of action will be.</li>\n<li>I want to add support for locales that use right-to-left text.</li>\n<li>We haven''t looked into how accessible Twine is at all yet, which is a woeful omission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The interesting part to me will be making a decision as to what to prioritize. I''m not sure there is a wrong answer here -- more a question of what will benefit the largest part of the user population.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

(Mobile ones? Maybe someday.)</p>\n<p><strong>Prehistory (or: 2008)</strong></p>\n<p>When I first conceived Twine, it would have been possible to build it as a Web-based system-- and others had. The one I can recall from that time was called <a href="http://futureofthebook.org/blog/2008/03/03/hypertextopia/">Hypertextopia</a> (by the way, that Chris person in the comments of that blog entry sure does sound familiar -- and I wonder <a href="http://backbonejs.org">whatever</a> <a href="http://coffeescript.org">happened</a> to that <a href="https://twitter.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> fellow who made Hypertextopia). I chose to make Twine a desktop app because I was deeply paranoid about my own creative work. I didn''t want it bound up in Somebody Else''s Website, especially if there was no way for me to retrieve it and re-use as I like. I have somewhat mellowed in the belief since then, but I still hold to it. I think it''s a safe bet that most web sites you encounter will not exist in five years. Hypertextopia doesn''t.</p>\n<p>So -- to Python I went, and sweated out the details of producing cross-platform apps with wxWidgets. It was (and perhaps is-- I am not very well-informed in these matters) a fairly popular option, but it was never very fun. I spent way more time that I ever would have wanted learning the syntax of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System">NSIS</a> -- all just to allow people to install Twine on Windows. I would borrow other people''s laptops just to try to fix problems on operating systems I didn''t own (sometimes this was Windows; sometimes OS X). I never had the appetite to figure out how to package it appropriately for Linux, though it was entirely technically feasible to run it there.</p>\n<p>A lot of wasted time, in short.</p>\n<p><strong>History (or: two years ago)</strong></p>\n<p>When I began work on Twine 2, I knew I didn''t want to go back the direction I had taken before, or I would burn out just like before. I flirted with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR">Adobe AIR</a> but all news emanating from Adobe regarding it was ominous, so I decided: let''s do this as a pure web app. Once I understood <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html">local storage</a> and saw, miraculously, that JavaScript <a href="http://eligrey.com/blog/post/saving-generated-files-on-the-client-side/">can trigger downloads</a> (in most browsers, of course -- not all), it seemed possible to make a web-based, but not web-hosted version.</p>\n<p>That is, although you might use Twine in your web browser, the things you make with it stay on your machine.</p>\n<p>I''ll admit, the contradiction in this appealed to me. But it also confuses people who use Twine 2 online, and I think always will. We expect that when we go to http://somewhere, the things we type into our browser go to http://somewhere, and probably be saved there. We''ve been trained to think this way since the beginning.</p>\n<p>And, more urgently, because browsers expect web applications to stuff furtive and ephemeral things into local storage -- offline caches, user preferences -- they give no warning as to how grave it is to delete it.</p>\n<p>In <a href="http://twinery.org/2/#welcome">the onboarding page of Twine 2</a>, I wrote an explanation of what was going on; even so, I would overhear people on Twitter lamenting the loss of their data and feel like a horrible person. Later, I wrote <a href="http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:where_your_stories_are_saved">a whole page of the guide</a> on this topic alone and added large notes trying to draw attention to it.</p>\n<p>I think it was as I was wrapping up writing the guide page that I realized:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There''s always going to be someone who forgets these warnings or just never understands them, no matter how good a job I do.</li>\n<li>This is terrible user interface design.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I''m a firm believer that if you write sentences like, &quot;Never do this, or terrible terrible things will happen&quot; in your documentation, you should instead go back to the drawing board and redesign your application so that those terrible things can never happen.</p>\n<p><strong>The Present Day (or: last month)</strong></p>\n<p>So here we are: a native app courtesy <a href="http://nwjs.io">NW.js</a>. It looks exactly like the web version! All it does differently is put files in an obvious folder instead of saving to the browser''s invisible local storage. This is very intentional. I started down the path of adding things like a real File menu, where you would be able to open story files directly. But it was like tugging a loose thread on a sweater. An Open menu item begs for a Save option too -- except Twine 2 constantly saves your work. How would that even work?</p>\n<p>(There was <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/issue/123/add-last-saved-text-to-editor">a feature request</a> to show an indicator when Twine 2 saves your work, as assurance. What I found was that during any editing, that indicator flickered on nearly constantly. Of course it does it after you stop editing a passage-- but it also does it when you drag a passage, or add a new one, and on and on.)</p>\n<p>The idea of building a wholly separate desktop, filesystem-oriented Twine 2 in parallel to a web-based one is daunting to me. It would mean a lot of design work, and worse-- testing would become a lot harder, and stay difficult. I have automated <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org">Selenium</a> tests that exercise the entire web application, and religiously run through them previous to every release. They are annoying to create, but maintaining them is considerably less so. Creating a new set of tests for three separate platforms and keeping them in sync doesn''t seem fun at all.</p>\n<p>It''s easy to forget that this would also mean writing a whole other set of documentation, too.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, my plan for now is to make the native adaptations for Twine 2 as minimal as possible, so that the Selenium tests resemble the native experience. The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/src/d77157edd0072d770aedfe797e85e44ebc6f5dd6/js/nwui.js?at=default">native-specific code</a> right now stands at 535 lines long, with four bugs reported against it thus far. (There are probably more, of course.)</p>\n<p>I don''t see the online version going away anytime soon. It''s still the best method for people using tablets for now, and despite everything I just wrote, there is still something utterly compelling about being able to go to a web site, click a link, and just write. No password to remember, no terms of service to agree to without reading.

Partly this is because I haven''t had as much time in the past few months to work on Twine as I had earlier in the year, but it''s also because a lot of that work focused on a single bullet point there: &quot;Added experimental native app builds.&quot;</p>\n<p>There really ought to be a full-fledged README to go with <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/downloads">these builds</a>, but in lieu of that, here are some notes on what''s going on.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait, I thought Twine 2 was a browser thing?</strong> Yes, and it really still is. The app versions use a tool called <a href="http://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a> to bind the app into executable versions that are basically a stripped-down browser that only runs Twine.</p>\n<p>The main difference for now between the web version and these builds is that instead of storing your stories in a place you can''t easily see or get to (your web browser''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage">local storage</a>), it saves your stories to your Documents folder, under Twine &gt; Stories. Because of this, you won''t see an available space gauge in the story list. I trust your operating system will take care of letting you know if you start to run out of hard drive space.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is there no File menu? How do I open files or even save them?</strong> I want to keep the web and app versions as much as in sync as possible, because trying to maintain two separate versions of the app, let alone testing them on three separate platforms, is beyond my current capacity. I found it to be a slippery slope. I tried out adding an Open File menu item, but that begged for being able to open multiple files at once, and a Save option only makes sense if an individual story is in the frontmost window on OS X, which requires extra coding, and on and on.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I found testing even two platforms (sorry Linux users -- for the initial release I kept my focus on OS X and Windows, but I hope the binaries will work) exhausting. I used a VirtualBox VM to test Windows issues; despite NW.js promising a seamlessly cross-platform experience, the reality is not perfect. I still don''t understand why the menus in Windows do not show keyboard shortcuts, though they do seem to respond to them properly. (I fear I''m making some embarrassing elementary error -- this is my first rodeo with NW.js.) The experience is eerily similar to working with wxPython in the Twine 1.x series, I have to say. 95% of it works as advertised, but that other 5% is painful.</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that a Serious Local App is an unreasonable thing to try to strive for in the future, but I don''t see it happening in the near term. I am curious whether people who were holding out for a local app version will find this acceptable. I won''t be too offended if you hate it, promise.</p>\n<p>Anyway, for now I''m following the library metaphor similar to, say, iTunes. You can import stories into the editor from somewhere else, which copies them to the Stories folder. You cannot modify them externally while Twine is open, but you can copy them, rename them, and delete them while the app is closed.</p>\n<p>Just like the browser version (and for that matter, HyperCard), your work is automatically saved as you go. Incidentally, we''ve improved error reporting while saving in this version, and you can now verify that a story has been saved by pointing at the story menu -- the tooltip now shows when the last time it was successfully saved.</p>\n<p><strong>The app just ate all my work. Thanks a lot!</strong> These apps are experimental, so I would diligently keep copies of your work just in case. That said, I''ve been using the OS X version for several weeks now without any hitting any problems.</p>\n<p>But let''s say the impossible happens and something goes wrong -- you should report bugs <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/issues/new">here</a>.

After getting a little turned around coming out of the parking garage, I found the sometime-courthouse, sometime-<a href="https://twitter.com/thingstitute">Thingstitute</a>, that CoderDojoDC now calls home.</p>\n<p>It is quite something to enter a room and see a middle school-aged girl quietly working with software you created. Of course, at first I felt gratification and a sense of wonder at how far Twine''s reach had grown -- but it also left me a little detached. Twine is bigger than me. It just is, and it has been for some time now.</p>\n<p>I took a seat in the gallery. The workshop actually took place in the courtroom, no joke, with a giant screen mounted beside the judge''s bench (that no doubt shows Exhibit A on weekdays) repurposed as one kid''s workspace. The rest of the group worked at tables set up where the prosecution and defense would be. The kids ranged in ages from first grade (one girl, anyway, who wrote an adorable Twine story that began by interrogating the reader as to whether they liked cats or dogs) to perhaps late middle school, and at a rough count ran 55%/45% male-to-female.</p>\n<p>After some opening administrivia, Melissa, the session facilitator who was kind enough to reach out to me in the first place, gave a quick introduction to Twine to the kids.</p>\n<p><a href="http://chrisklimas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1153-e1424235956844.jpg"><img src="../images/IMG_1153-e1424235956844.jpg" alt="Twine Intro #1"></a> <a href="http://chrisklimas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1154-e1424236008508.jpg"><img src="../images/IMG_1154-e1424236008508.jpg" alt="Twine Intro #2"></a> <a href="http://chrisklimas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1155-e1424236030887.jpg"><img src="../images/IMG_1155-e1424236030887.jpg" alt="Twine Intro #3"></a> <a href="http://chrisklimas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1156-e1424236046999.jpg"><img src="../images/IMG_1156-e1424236046999.jpg" alt="Twine Intro #4"></a></p>\n<p>These were posters Melissa had created as reference points for the session. Again, a little strange to see design decisions you and others made long ago written out in schoolteacher handwriting as Fact. (Sure, I winced a little bit at the <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> tag, but can you really explain what <code>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;</code> does in five sentences or fewer?)</p>\n<p>I spoke to the group as a whole for a few minutes, prompted with questions from Melissa. One thing that was particularly nice to be able to say is that I originally wrote Twine in Python, the same language that the kids themselves had played with before. And then... we were off.</p>\n<p>The kids seemed to understand the concept of a Choose Your Own Adventure immediately. The last time I gave a workshop on Twine, I worried that no one would even know what I was talking about if I mentioned CYOAs -- not so here. I''m not sure if it''s because the interactivity of video games is easily translated to text, because of the recent CYOA reissues, or if somehow CYOAs have become part of our pop cultural genetic memory.</p>\n<p>The other concept they grasped easily, interestingly enough, was [[double bracketing]] links to create new passages. It only had to be explained to them once. This crowd was self-selected, of course-- these are kids who are learning programming languages, so the concept of using funny characters to add behavior would probably not be foreign to them.</p>\n<p>Still... one of the objectives I have had for Twine 2 for a long time was to implement a WYSIWYG editor. A first pass, where you click a button to turn text bold or italic, is easy enough to implement. But after playing with it myself, I''m not sure that it offers a significant improvement in ease-of-use, because macro code still remains. Take a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_sherman/status/568085869783068672">this screenshot</a>, for example. A standard WYSIWYG editor won''t help tame this kind of rat''s-nest (no offense meant, Mr. Sherman).</p>\n<p>The logical conclusion would be to build a graphical interface for macros, something akin to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, and doing that successfully strikes me as ambitious an undertaking as Twine itself. So I wonder if it is more effective for the time being to focus on making the process of writing code more pleasurable. A button to add bold formatting still seems useful to me even so, because even I have to look back at a Markdown cheatsheet occasionally. But we''ve never helped people create links with autocomplete, for example. Simple things you would expect out of any programming environment.</p>\n<p>But I digress a bit. At the end of the workshop, kids who were so inclined could demo their work to the rest of the group. They showed themselves to be merciless game designers, to a degree that surely would bring a tear of pride to the eye of any gamebook designer from the 80''s. Death was by far the preferred method of ending a non-optimal narrative branch. Memorably, one story asked if you would like to continue exploring the surface of Mars or return home (also located on Mars). If you choose to go home: (paraphrased) &quot;You return to your family and starve to death.&quot; No, food had not been previously mentioned as a problem. A few stories even taunted players when they first started that they most likely would end up dead in-story.</p>\n<p>Presumably no one attending that day had played <em>Dark Souls</em> yet -- so I wonder if it just a inherent property of choice-based games that death is the easiest route to the words THE END, or perhaps this is true of stories in general. Or maybe kids are just really bloody-minded. (Or... perhaps all these things are true.)</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful experience overall, of course. One kid told called me over as he was working and told me he named the main character of his story after me. His first choice? Whether to go to a DARPA robotics competition. I''m sure you can guess what the right answer was.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://chrisklimas.com/blog/2014-09-23-twine2-beta','Beta',replace('<p>At very long last, Twine 2.0 has entered beta. You can <a href="https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/downloads">download it from Bitbucket</a>, or play with it <a href="http://twinery.org/2">right now</a>.</p>\n<p>The word <em>beta</em> has been abused to the point that it is essentially meaningless, like <em>HD</em> or <em>cloud</em>, but I''m a bit of a traditionalist about it. To me, it means no more features until the real release, only fixes. It means we''re close to a final release. So it''s an exciting milestone for me.</p>\n<h2>The long road to now</h2>\n<p>I''ve been keeping mostly quiet about Twine 2 while things were in the design phase, so let me catch you up on what I''ve been working on. My first goal with Twine 2 has been to fix all of the infelicitous parts of Twine 1. <a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/twine/">Anna''s tutorial</a> was incredibly instructive, because all the things she warns you about shouldn''t be things you have to remember. That means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You no longer have to remember that to name your first passage Start -- you just click the little rocketship icon next to the passage you''d like to start with. (I remain unsure if <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/">another icon</a> would be more obvious, but my thought for now is that it''s lifting off the launchpad.)</li>\n<li>You no longer have to play hypertext janitor and add every new passage you link to. It''s pretty hard now to create broken links in a story, I think. As soon as you add a new link, Twine will create a passage for you.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to remember that CSS needs to go into passages tagged ''stylesheet,'' or JavaScript goes into ''script.'' There''s a separate place for each in the editor.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to remember that the name of your story has to go into a passage named StoryTitle. You just rename the story in the editor.</li>\n<li>You no longer have to capitalize passage names in links exactly right.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these changes are overdue and unexciting. The more interesting part is that it''s a browser-based application. <em>This does not mean it is necessarily web-based</em>. I''ll come back to this point in a moment. Going browser-based solves one of the biggest hassles I had with Twine 1: compatibility with the variety of Windows and OS X versions (and poor left-out Linux users, who I threw a vague bone to with some bare-bones instructions) that the world uses. I had hoped that <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> were ecumenical enough to allow me to ignore the differences between platforms, and that turned out to be mostly true. But when Twine crashed inexplicably on people''s computers, I had no idea how to figure it out, as inevitably they would be on a platform I didn''t have access to. Trying to debug an application over email is excruciating.</p>\n<p>So while a browser-based application still means experiencing the rich pageant known as browser compatibility testing, the truth is modern browsers aren''t vastly different anymore, and it''s a lot easier to get your hands on, say, <a href="https://modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">Internet Explorer 9</a> if you need to chase down a bug.</p>\n<p>Going browser-based also makes it much easier to get Twine onto other platforms. Linux is now a first-class citizen in Twineland, and there''s now support for writing Twine stories on a tablet, whether it''s running iOS, Android, or something stranger. (This still is a bit rough in places -- but we''ll get there by the time there''s a real release.) I even eventually would like to explore bringing Twine back in desktop application form via <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit">node-webkit</a>. So far as I can see, it''s the only good way to tackle multimedia. And who knows? Maybe Twine will end up as a Chrome Store or Firefox OS app too.</p>\n<p>Anyway, while I''ve been coding myself silly with the new Twine editor, Leon Arnott has been working on fixing all the infelicitous parts of the Twine runtime, and in fact adding a ton of new features. He''s been keeping his notes on what''s changed on his <a href="http://twine2.neocities.org/">Twine 2 site</a>.</p>\n<p>It is also be possible to create custom story formats for Twine 2, just the same as in Twine 1. I''m working on formal specs for people to follow right now. If you''re interested in creating a story format, then please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>\n<h2>About freedom</h2>\n<p>When people hear that Twine is browser-based, they often assume that it will require creating an account on a web site, with all of the nastiness related to ownership of content, terms of service, and so on that can ensue. I think that there''s definitely room for a server-based Twine, but I have been designing Twine 2.0 so that it will be completely functional if you download it to your computer and run it locally. It doesn''t require any kind of install procedure, even. (Lord knows how much fun I got out of writing NSIS installer scripts.) You just unzip the archive and open index.html inside.</p>\n<p>I believe that one of the core values of Twine is that your work belongs to you, and that shouldn''t ever change.</p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>If you love Twine as much as I do, please consider <a href="https://gratipay.com/Chris%20Klimas/">supporting its development</a>.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://chrisklimas.com/blog/2014-04-22-129','War, Pestilence, Famine, Death, and Twine',replace('<p><em>I originally wrote this post for <a href="http://storycade.com/war-pestilence-famine-death-twine/">StoryCade</a>.</em></p>\n<p>There’s something unusual about the announcement of <a href="http://xyzzyawards.org/?p=261">this year’s XYZZY Awards finalists</a>. For the first time since since Inform 7 was released in 2006, most of the XYZZY Awards finalists were not created with it. In fact, this is the first time in the entire seventeen-year history of the XYZZY Awards that the plurality of nominees were not created with some version of Inform.</p>\n<p>Instead, Twine has taken that title — admittedly, by a narrow margin of ten finalists to seven. But for those inclined to fear the demise of the parser form, this is one more portent of doom. The most recent Interactive Fiction Competition, the other major yearly event in the IF community, had more web-based games entered into it than parser-based ones. I think Carl Muckenhoupt, who maintains the venerable Baf’s Guide to the Interactive Fiction Archive, <a href="http://www.wurb.com/stack/archives/2632">describes the traditionalist position best</a>. To excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Magnus Olsson, in a memorable 1997 raif post, compared the IF community to a jazz club, and these bossy newcomers to someone who goes to the club to tell everyone in the club that jazz is dead and they should all be using pre-programmed synthesizers instead. No matter how good his arguments are, they’re going to be ignored by the people who showed up because they like jazz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no doubt that Twine and its kind represent a different paradigm of interactive fiction. But I think there’s more opportunity here for devotees of parser IF than there is ill omen. Easy for me to say, right? I created Twine. Of course I think this is a positive development. But I really do believe this, and I’ve got three arguments why.</p>\n<h2>1. It’s Safe To Rock The Boat Now</h2>\n<p>I think the growth of Twine and other parserless systems demonstrates a maturation of the interactive fiction community. When the IF community first coalesced online, we imitated our heroes: Infocom, Level 9, Magnetic Scrolls. Maybe even some weirdos still idolized <a href="http://www.msadams.com/">Scott Adams</a>. I think we did this out of a desire to preserve that which we loved and thought was quickly disappearing from the landscape of computer games. Recall that <a href="http://www.spagmag.org/">SPAG</a>, the longest-running net IF publication, was once titled the Society for the Preservation of Adventure Games. It was only in 1997, after the IF Competition had run for two years, that G. Kevin Wilson felt it was safe to re-acronymize as the Society for the Promotion of Adventure Games.</p>\n<p>An excerpt from his <em><a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/info/authorship-guide.base">Whizzard’s Guide to Text Adventure Authorship</a></em>, which he wrote in 1994, gives a good sense of what things were like back then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FOUND: One battered old text parser. It seems to somehow portray the lost innocence and fun in video games. Appears to have been carelessly tossed aside in the rush to appease mouse-hungry users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We believed that text-based games were a dying breed, and we were true believers awash in a sea of thoughtless, trivial games. Although there was some <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html">Amiga Persecution Complex</a> involved, it was a perception not completely removed from reality. Games came in boxes you plucked from store shelves, not in ZIP files you downloaded from the internet, and the selection was accordingly narrower. Even graphical adventures were beginning to wane.</p>\n<p>Of course, IF didn’t disappear the way we feared it would. People still write parser games — in fact, the tools to produce parser games have long since surpassed what was available during the commercial era — and people still play them. And now that we no longer feel this existential threat, we have the freedom to experiment.</p>\n<p>We’ve been experimenting all along, of course. One of the very first things we tinkered with was what a score meant in the context of a story-game. We asked ourselves, if we take points away from players, is it still a game that they are playing? (<em>I-0</em>) What if we take away puzzles to be solved (<em>In the End</em>), or verbs to be entered (<em>The Space Under the Window</em>)? What if the game consists of only a conversation in a single room? (<em>Galatea</em>) We played with alternate perspectives (<em>Muse: An Autumn Romance</em>) and narrators (<em>Rameses</em>).</p>\n<p>We have progressed to the point where we are brave enough to ask, if we take away the &gt; prompt, is it still interactive fiction that we are playing?</p>\n<p>Twine is just one way of asking this question. Inklewriter and ChoiceScript ask it in similar sorts of ways; StoryNexus, Versu, and Seltani come at different angles.</p>\n<p>For some, the answer to this latest question may in fact be no. For some, the answer to questions much earlier than now may have been no. And that’s fine. The point is that questioning the bounds of a medium is a sign of its strength and vivacity, not its frailty.</p>\n<h2>2. A Short Digression Featuring Disguised Infographics That Hint at the Fate of All Monocultures</h2>\n<p>Imagine a world where all music was composed for three instruments:</p>\n<p><img src="../images/2008_fake.png" alt="2008_fake"></p>\n<p>You can compose quite a lot of music for just three instruments, of course. Each of these are versatile. But wouldn’t you prefer to listen to music from a world that looks more like this?</p>\n<p><img src="../images/2013_fake.png" alt="2013_fake"></p>\n<p>You anticipate my point, I’m sure. These aren’t completely fabricated pie charts. The percentages match the systems used to build the XYZZY Awards nominees for 2008, five years ago, and 2013. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvudEBtsU4BMdFd1ZEpFR1MwVHBwRE11dzY4S3ZyTFE&amp;usp=sharing">Check my work</a> if you like.</p>\n<p><img src="../images/2008.png" alt="2008"> <img src="../images/2013.png" alt="2013"></p>\n<p>If you were a composer, which world would you prefer to live in?</p>\n<h2>3. Many People Will Eventually Want an Apple in a Knapsack</h2>\n<p>Let’s say, though, that all you care about in this wide world of interactive narrative gaming are parser games. Do not bother me with these point-and-clicks, you say. I shall not trifle with the vagaries of visual novels. Do not even mention the word Storytron in my house! You love the piano and no other instrument. Even for strange people like yourself, I think the influx of Twine games is good news.</p>\n<p>The reason why is that even I don’t believe that Twine is the best development system. I think that it’s good at what it was designed to be good at: hypertext. But I also think that if you stick with Twine long enough, you’ll eventually bump up against its limitations. Maybe someday, you’ll want to have the player put an apple inside a knapsack and then place that in a refrigerator the player can push around. Games have been created from stranger mechanics.</p>\n<p>Twine doesn’t have a world model. It has variables and flags, but those are tough tools to work with if you are trying to build a simulated world that can be toyed with in any real way.</p>\n<p>So eventually, after futzing helplessly around with <code>$appleInKnapsack</code>, <code>$knapsackInFridge and not $knapsackOnTopOfFridge</code>, and <code>$fridgeDoorClosed</code>, you might think to look for something better to realize your dream of objects containing objects containing objects. You might try Inform or TADS (or maybe even ADRIFT or Hugo, if you are well-read). You hopefully have heard of them in your short interactive fiction career. Ideally, you regard them as neighbors three doors down; you haven’t had a chance, or a really a reason to visit, but you wave to each other on the way to work. They’ve always seemed like friendly, good-natured people. Talking with them is a natural next step.</p>\n<p>I really do believe that a decent number of people now making Twine games would also enjoy trying their hand at parser. I also think there are many people in the parser IF community who are trying very hard to be good neighbors. The folks who run the IF Archive and IFDB, for example, have been welcoming to Twine games. The Twine app never appeared on the IF Archive until very recently because I thought it wouldn’t have been wanted there — but I was wrong.</p>\n<h2>The Long View</h2>\n<p>This year may turn out to be a blip in the history of interactive fiction. Twine became popular for reasons I didn’t predict, and if it becomes unpopular, it will probably do so for similarly unfathomable reasons. I’m not worried so much about that. What I do really hope happens is that colors keep getting added to that pie chart. More isn’t always better– but here, I really do believe, it is.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

If you''re not familiar with Mark, he''s the chief scientist at Eastgate Systems, which publishes hypertext works-- and more relevant to the discussion at hand, <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/storyspace/">Storyspace</a>, a hypertext authoring tool that was created in the 80s. Among his remarks was this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Twine has no model for building a literary economy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can imagine I have some things to say about this, but allow me to digress briefly to address a misconception that has bothered me for some time, on the subject of guard fields. Mark also said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not clear that Twine’s design fully appreciates the crucial role that Storyspace guard fields play in structuring large hypertext narrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I''ve never actually used Storyspace, only read works produced with it, but there seem to be ample explanations available online of what its guard fields are about. If I understand properly, a guard field puts conditional logic on whether a reader can visit a node (what Twine calls a passage).</p>\n<p>To which I''d like to retort: of course Twine is capable of guard field functionality. Let me direct you to the <a href="http://twinery.org/wiki/if">&lt;<if>&gt; macro documentation</a> on the Twine wiki. Not only can you block a reader from following a link without fulfulling certain conditions (e.g. <code>&lt;&lt;if $hasKey and $searchedRoom&gt;&gt;[[Open the hidden door]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;</code>), but you can also design passages whose contents change based on previous actions the reader has taken.</p>\n<p>I hope this doesn''t seem as though I''m quibbling. It''s just that this is not the first time I''ve seen someone suggest Twine couldn''t do guard fields.</p>\n<p>Now, as to whether Twine encourages or discourages a literary economy-- it''s a slightly odd idea to me. Did typewriters encourage a literary economy? How about pencils?</p>\n<p>I see two aspects of Twine that intersect with the notion of an economy, at least the sort of economy that conducts its business with dollars: first, that it''s open source and thus doesn''t require you to spend money to use it, and second, it produces HTML-formatted work that is easy to share and is difficult to sell. Perhaps if I had put a price tag on Twine, it would have encouraged people to try to sell their work to recoup their initial investment. More likely, it would have relegated Twine to a tiny userbase.</p>\n<p>But the real reason that I made Twine open source is that I believe that creative tools should be as accessible as possible. I remember being a high school student and wishing I could get my hands on a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director">Macromind Director</a>, for example. I wanted to make games like <em>Myst</em>. But how could I have possibly convinced my parents to lay down hundreds of dollars so I could maybe produce something interesting? I certainly wouldn''t have been able to sell my work.</p>\n<p>In a more enlightened/affluent time, perhaps my school system would have done the purchasing for me, or perhaps even my public library would have had a copy available to use. Instead, I downloaded <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/">Inform 5</a>. A year or two later, when I mentioned my Director-lust to a sympathetic online acquaintance, he mailed me (mailed me! can you imagine?) burned CD-ROMs of Director along with a serial number Sharpie''d on their surface. I never installed them.</p>\n<p>I understand that complicated tools take time to produce and that the people who work on them deserve to be paid for that time. I respect that decision, and I hope they''ll respect mine.</p>\n<p>The decision to output HTML was purely technical at the start of things. Twine was based on <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>, which lives and breathes HTML. I think it''s technical suicide to output any other format, regardless. HTML is our lingua franca, and I think it''s the file format capable of hypertext most likely to be readable five hundred years after I die. I worry about these things, and <a href="http://www.eliterature.org/pad/afb.html">so should you</a>.</p>\n<p>Is it hard to sell HTML files? Certainly. And yet people do. Zoe Quinn will soon be selling <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">Depression Quest</a> on Steam. Anna Anthropy sells <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/veryveryscary">a very very VERY scary house</a> on Gumroad. To me, this is no more difficult than selling a PDF, a file format people are not often in the habit of purchasing. But it happens -- witness <a href="http://dndclassics.com">dndclassics.com</a> or the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/">Nielsen Norman Group''s reports</a>. (I wonder what it says about me that those are the two examples that spring to mind.)</p>\n<p>The alternative, I suppose, is to output binary code, whether a desktop app or a mobile one. People expect to pay money for code, even if it''s just a thin veneer over content. I have no problem at all with anyone doing that with Twine stories. I don''t know much about how to do these things, but I would accept a pull request for Twine to add that functionality. Would I even be okay with someone building a tool to do this and charging money for it? Yes.</p>\n<p>I think there''s always room for open source and commercial interests to intermingle. I did this with <a href="http://libzoetrope.org/">Zoetrope</a>; anybody is free to use the library if they like, but I sell <a href="http://twofoldsecret.com">the creative work I made with it</a>.

If it’s text, it’s “Why doesn’t the parser understand me still?” So the core gameplay of adventure games is actually fumbling through something, right? And that’s true with modern [versions]. All the episodic stuff that’s coming out. And there’s a whole community that makes modern interactive fiction games and all this stuff. And it’s true for all these games.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He touches a nerve in the modern-day IF community. Bad parsers are what the heyday of interactive fiction is remembered for among mainstream gamers. Homestar Runner parodied this in Thy Dungeonman; lingering in the shadow of the first major East Coast IF meetup in years at PAX East was Action Castle, a live rendition of a text adventure which relished in classically hackneyed phrasings like “You see a thing here,” “Exits are west, east, and in,” and whose moderator gleefully retorted “I don’t know how to do that” or “You see no [whatever] here” whenever a player said a sentence more complicated than what a dog could comprehend. These parodies were affectionate, of course, but illustrative of a problem the IF community has struggled with since players first found themselves standing west of a white house with a small mailbox nearby. It’s not like that anymore.</p>\n<p>And it’s true. Great steps forward have been taken in the technology underpinning modern interactive fiction. Synonyms flower across these games with such density that if you wish to call the metal container of water at your feet a bucket, pail, or for that matter, just a container, you can use whichever word you wish. Likewise, you can dig, excavate, or burrow to your heart’s content. You’re even allowed conjunctions, so that you can open an airplane door, don a parachute, and leap out in one command. Mazes, the most infamously laborious and frustrating convention of the medium, are extinct. And there are drop-in extensions authors can add to their games that provide friendly, well-written introductions for new players that explain the basic commands needed to get around. Heck, there’s even an attractively-designed postcard that summarizes things for you.</p>\n<p>But even with all this progress, I would argue there are still awkward moments in these games. I recently played Sand-dancer by Aaron A. Reed, which is notable for not only being a well-paced, accessible bit of IF, but it’s also a worked exercise he created for a book that teaches one of the modern-day IF programming languages, Inform 7. Reed is an experienced author; Sand-dancer is well-paced and forgiving; I’ve had an enormous amount of experience playing IF games; and yet I was struggling to find a way to make the game let me pick up a tin can to use with another puzzle. It wasn’t that the game didn’t understand what I was trying to say. It was refusing to allow me to take that action. “You won’t be hungry again till morning,” it explained. But I didn’t want the can to eat its contents, I wanted to use it for another purpose.</p>\n<p>The reason for the problem was that the cans were meant to be ignored once a previous puzzle centering around them had been solved. I-as-a-player had come up with a potential line of attack that I-as-character (or perhaps he-as-author) didn’t conceive of.</p>\n<p>Such problems are inevitable, I believe, but they aren’t inherent to the medium of IF alone. I think Blow is correct to call IF games confusion, but then I think he ought to call every game a confusion. From a certain point of view, games are a struggle — a confusion, a fumbling — with an interface in order to accomplish a goal. We want Mario to jump across a gap. If we press the buttons correctly, he does. We want to shoot the other players before they shoot us. If we move the mouse precisely, we do. We want our city to flourish. If we use the zoning tools properly in our interface, we do.</p>\n<p>Where Jonathan Blow errs is implying that the struggles in adventure games are all elementary ones, where players cannot even begin to operate the interface. That era of interactive fiction, if it ever existed, is over. But there are still hiccups, and they’re part of the experience. I still yell, “I pressed the jump button!” at platformer games as my character plummets into a hole. I’d imagine most people who’ve played platformers for any length of time have had that experience, and we don’t fault the entire platformer genre for it.</p>\n<p>There is also a rarer type of frustration in the platformer genre that more closely matches the frustrations of IF: I want to get over there but I don’t know how. The best examples I can think of are the Kaizo Mario-style masocore platformers, where blocks and enemies are placed in such a way that you cannot proceed without doing exactly what the designer intended. You want to move to the right side of the screen in a platformer but get stymied by what appears to be unavoidable death; you want to open a door in an IF game but can’t find a key.</p>\n<p>The question, then, is if this confusion is unavoidable, is it pleasurable? And here I think IF is handicapped. IF proponents often argue that textual descriptions inspire the imagination more than graphics. That may be when you’re on the right track in  an IF game, but I think it’s different when you’re running into trouble. Whereas you at least have cheery graphics and music to content you while you work out the solution to a frustrating Mario level, grappling with an uncooperative IF game has about the same level of sensory engagement as compiling a Linux kernel.</p>\n<p>Even so, there are standouts. Jeremy Freese’s Violet does an admirable job of creating a narrative voice, for example. Instead of the standard response, “That’s not a verb I recognize,” it tells the player, “Sorry for being confused, budgie, but you’re going to have to use a different verb for me to follow you.” Even though the player isn’t making any progress in the game per se, the game is building engagement in the world.</p>\n<p>I think it’s ultimately a matter of taste. Do you enjoy honing your reflexes to seemingly inhuman levels? Then play I Wanna Be The Guy. But most people don’t; at least not to the level that game requires. Likewise, some people like reasoning things out by typing things on a keyboard. To each his own.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

If you turn on a Nintendo Entertainment System without inserting a cartridge first, its power light simply blinks on and off as your television set displays a gray screen. But — there is a subtlety here not often found in computers. If the NES senses a cartridge but cannot read its contents properly, it will sometimes show its initial screen but with corrupted graphics, or with the first note of its song strung out into an endless tone.</p>\n<p>This is a harmless occurrence whose traditional remedy is taking out the cartridge and blowing into its contacts, to clear out any dust. It’s a familiar, comfortable ritual to anyone who owned a NES in its heyday, like cleaning your glasses or trimming your fingernails.</p>\n<p>When I was a child, I once turned on my father’s Atari 2600 with a cartridge half-inserted by accident. Instead of displaying a message, an icon, or even corrupted graphics, it emitted an unholy, piercingly loud shriek.</p>\n<p>I found out later that this process is called frying, and that if you do it skillfully, you can alter gameplay — by causing sprites to act contrary to their programming, or the world of the game itself to warp.</p>\n<p>But as a kid, I was scared shitless by the sound.</p>\n<p>I scrambled to the 2600, turned it off, and didn’t touch it for the rest of the day, terrified of what might happen if I turned it on again. Such was my introduction to the world of secrets in video games.</p>\n<p>Modern consumers expect games to have secrets. The more accessible game series, like Lego Whatever and Rock Band, put them right on the main menu. You do a Web search for them, tap the buttons it tells you to, and then you are immortal, or you never have to worry about running out of ammunition, or a tank falls out of the sky in front of you. A strong argument can be made that these secrets add immeasurably to a game. They allow players to bypass a section of a game that’s poorly designed and much too difficult or frustrating as a result, or conversely they allow players who’ve mastered the game to try new variations on its mechanics. They also allow players who just want to raise hell in Grand Theft Auto to jump in a tank whenever they like.</p>\n<p>But there’s something that has changed as the conventions of games have solidified: intentionality. When you enter a cheat code in the new Goldeneye, you know that the game developers meant for you to do so. They may have specifically added the code for use by you, as opposed to cheats that were added to speed along the testing process during development. Secrets have become the equivalent of asking for something under-the-counter at a drugstore. They’re not officially on offer, but only in a wink-and-nod sort of way.</p>\n<p>The original Super Mario Brothers, as always, has instructive examples. The warp zones were intentionally placed into levels to make up for the fact that SMB had no save feature. If you’ve already mastered world 3, you can skip it by displaying an extra level of mastery in world 2. Compare warp zones to the infamous minus world. I’d be willing to bet that the majority of people who played SMB have at one point used a warp pipe, but that the number who have actually entered the minus world is very small. I’m not part of it, at least. There is an element of the inexplicable to the way players enter the minus world — crouch-jump while facing the wrong way? how do you do that? — and once entered, the level ends abruptly in a blank wall. In a game where there is genius in nearly every block placement, the apparent randomness of the minus world is a disconcerting aberration.</p>\n<p>The minus world disappeared from SMB sequels for obvious reasons. It was a glitch in game code. It was, to belabor the point, unintentional. But the question I want to pose is, which is a more interesting secret, a warp zone or a minus world? Which is more memorable?</p>\n<p>I think that the answer to both questions is the unintentional, because it adds richness to the relationship between player and game. Most games are, from a certain point of view, deeply predictable experiences. There are rules as to what can or cannot occur in the world of the game, and developers spend many man-hours to ensure that the game enforces these rules rigidly and consistently. Players learn these rules and how to manipulate them in interesting ways — but still they remain in a well-designed playpen. Good games make the playpen impressively grand (Minecraft), fool players into either believing that it’s bigger than it actually is (Mass Effect), or find a way to content players with a small but focused experience (Portal).</p>\n<p>But when someone enters the minus world or fries a 2600, something changes in our understanding of a game. We’re not sure if we’re meant to see this. We’re not sure if there are interesting things to be found. But we’re inquisitive. We want to go exploring.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

A postscript -- the piece in question was <a href="http://www.logolalia.com/hypertexts/a-kiss.html">A Kiss</a> by Dan Waber.</em></p>\n<p>To counterbalance the gloominess I’ve been posting about recently:</p>\n<p>Last month, I got an email asking for help with Twine. It was running really slowly, the writer said, and it was nearly intolerable, working with the story map. After trading emails back and forth, I asked if I could look at the story file he was trying to work with, and he obliged. (I always feel a little strange asking for these things — at least I feel quite protective of my own work — but people have always been willing to share so far.)</p>\n<p>I opened it to find a total spaghetti of nodes and links. All in all: 300-some passages, about a thousand links running between them. This was, to put it lightly, more than I had ever expected my poor little program to deal with. The lines running to the central node were so tightly clumped together, in fact, they formed a kind of moire pattern. This was the worst-case scenario made flesh. It took maybe two seconds to redraw the map — not that long in the grand scheme of things, but when you just trying to scroll around, get a sense of things, you know, actually do work — it was agonizing.</p>\n<p>What caught my interest, though, was the content. I did not go poking around in it deeply — again I felt odd doing so — but I did want to see what some of the really critical nodes, the ones that caused the frame rate to plummet as soon as they came onscreen, were doing. So I caught the drift of it.</p>\n<p>It was a love poem.</p>\n<p>I came up with some quick optimizations to help him out — I had missed some very obvious things. For example, if a passage linked to the same place twice, Twine would actually go to the trouble of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twee/source/diff?spec=svn230&amp;r=230&amp;format=side&amp;path=/twine/trunk/storypanel.py">drawing the same line twice</a>. This helped a little, but the final solution was to allow users to turn off some of the prettier features of the story map to get better performance.</p>\n<p>I have a better solution in the works for the next version of Twine that should solve the problem entirely. (Briefly: it will save offscreen the parts of the story map that never change, so that each redraw of the map only manually draws what has changed — e.g. the passage you are dragging around, or the marquee selection you are making. Again, fairly elementary stuff.) I still hold onto that story file, mainly to test out optimizations, but also to remember what I’m doing helps people do real things, to make poetry even. There aren’t that many developers out there making things that people make poetry with. I feel lucky.</p>\n<p>(<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html">Quoth jwz</a>: “Your ‘use case’ should be, there’s a 22 year old college student living in the dorms.

(To skip to that part, search for “every writer develops” on the page.) Basically, for her it seemed to amount to keeping a map. But… then what? How did she decide what branches to prune? Did she think about trying to keep characters consistent between branches? Lots of questions. Granted, all this happened more than twenty years ago, and memory often fails. But it’s this kind of inquiry that really piques my curiosity. There are tons of manuals on how to write — <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/3569">some of them</a> are even good. There are <a href="http://www.deenalarsen.net/fundamentals/">almost none</a> on how to write nonlinear text. (If you can think of exceptions or recommendations, please please please leave a comment.)</p>\n<p>So to try to remedy it a little, I’m going to try documenting my own process, as I work. It’s a little scary because a) it feels awfully narcissistic — but then this is the Internet b) what if I fail? What if I give up? How embarrassing would that be? But <a href="http://susangibb.net/blog2/2009/08/100-days-project-afterglow/">Susan Gibb’s recent foray</a> into writing a complete hypertext story every day… <em>for 100 days</em>… has inspired me to suck it up a bit.</p>\n<p>So, let me tell you about this story. For now it is called <em>mountain.tws</em>, because that’s the filename and I haven’t thought of a real title yet and won’t for a long time. Here’s the story map; if you click on it, it’ll show you an exact word count. I have the story map zoomed out to where the text is greeked out because I’m kinda modest about it for now. The orange exclamation-point emblems show where I have unfinished business — e.g. links that don’t go anywhere yet. The box hanging out in the upper-right is a custom CSS style I wrote, because I want to stack my choices vertically on top of each other, whereas normally they get shown side-by-side.</p>\n<p>Right now it is really linear — you can see the branches keep folding into each other. I am hoping that it will eventually become deceptively linear, because later on, the story paths will explode, and I feel like I need to give the reader a little grounding at first before throwing them into the deep end. Deceptive is actually a good word for this part of the story — on its face I think it will look like straight-up exposition to the reader, but I’m trying to embed lots of clues in the text for later on.</p>\n<p>I am thinking of the piece as kind of a riddle (though not a puzzle). I see four endings right now, none really superior to the other, just different. I imagine that the first time through, the reader will hit an ending without really meaning to, and then see the message: <em>You have found one of four endings so far. Restart?</em> And then hopefully this will inspire them to go back and try to influence the story more consciously. That’s the ideal case for now. Maybe more careful readers will figure it out right away.</p>\n<p>Things I’m worried about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My first passage is kind of long. I worry the rhythm of the story and click will be off. But I really like all the text, and again I think it helps root the reader. We shall see.</li>\n<li>Is Alice, one of the main characters, too nondescript at this point? I have to leave her ambiguous right now for an important structural reason (that I don’t want to talk about yet) but I need to give her some character. Female ciphers are lazy writing.</li>\n<li>Are my choices well-motivated? I have to cheat a little to keep the storyline braided the way it is, so things are not super-permanent in that a choice doesn’t cause a totally different thread of the story to occur. But I have to keep that as hidden from the reader as I can, to maintain the illusion. I’m tweaking things by having dialogue lines change based on choices, though the main line of narrative stays the same, which is cool — but I have to keep the characters in line without making them seem like they’re bumping up against <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">invisible walls</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things I’m thinking about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have a thought about how to render one character’s dialogue that will make it stand out from everyone else’s. I’m going to mock this up in a separate HTML page and then move the JavaScript into my story once I’m happy with it.</li>\n<li>I have a pair of sentences I’m working towards: “You had been told that everyone has strange dreams the night before they walk the Pass, but you have none at all. You have never been a dreamer.” It’s like a tiny milestone to reach.</li>\n</ul>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

It’s tiny-tiny but still, it’s kind of cool to be on the same, er, stage.</p>\n<p>So it turns out Chris Crawford’s up to his old tricks. He’s “commercializing” his old work with the <a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/">Erasmatron</a> with a new doodad called <a href="http://www.storytron.com/">Storytronics</a>. Now before I write anything else, I should warn you that <a href="http://www.storytron.com/overview/ov_approaches.html">Chris thinks</a> that <strong>Gimcrack</strong>’d is obsolete, and as such I am very inclined to go all <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html">Linus vs. Andy</a> on him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There have been three main approaches to creating interactive storytelling technology: the unsuccessful “Branching Narrative” and “Narrative Game”, and Storytronics…</p>\n<p>… Many of the choices offered to the reader lead to an uninteresting story; one that was cut too short, ran too long, repeated itself or made no sense. Second, this method imposed severe restrictions on the player’s freedom of choice. There is no practical way to construct a flow chart large enough to give the reader true control – such a flowchart would require literally billions of nodes, linked together in an astoundingly complex logical structure.</p>\n<p>Instead, Branching Narratives usually give one the feeling of choosing “the lesser of two evils” between two options, because one is not allowed to do what one really wants to. Furthermore, many such narratives employ a technique called “foldback”, where two or more options lead to the same practical result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, Chris postulates that a human being can’t begin to try to create a truly interactive story because there are too many possibilities to consider. I think that’s true. He then proposes that the way to solve this problem is to generate your storylines programmatically — you set up some initial conditions that predispose the characters of the story toward conflict (hopefully), and then let ‘er rip. The reader gets to be a character who can screw around with things and lead the story toward a particular outcome.</p>\n<p>I have two criticisms: first, I think he’s got the cart before the horse. Basically, these initial conditions boil down to working with <em>theme</em>. You make a story generator that deals with betrayal by making the characters more or less willing to screw each other over, depending on how much they trust the other person. You make a story generator about love by… well, I don’t know. How would you calculate your attraction to someone else?</p>\n<p>But my main point is that theme is something that floats in the background as I write, but it’s never what drives my creative process. I have a vague idea about what a story I’m working on is about, but that changes as I write. I think in my best writing, I may be able to see the end of the story as I work but only just; I’m not sure where I’m going on a conscious level, but there is something working itself out deep down.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think Chris puts a little too much stock in interactivity. — Which may be a weird thing for someone allegedly writing interactive stories to write. But I don’t think people really want a storyworld where anything is possible. For one, we already have real life. But it’s not the range of choices that really makes an interactive story compelling; it’s their significance. And I think that’s where human intelligence and <em>gasp</em> craft comes into play. Deciding what choices to offer the reader, what outcomes to write, is an artistic decision.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here are some interesting notes from Laura Mixon, who wrote the only story I know of with Chris’ system: <a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/PILGRIM2.html">An E-Pilgrim’s Progress</a>, <a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/SHATTERTOWNSKY.html">Shattertown Sky: A Post-Partum</a>, and <a href="http://www.erasmatazz.com/library/StS_Blunders.html">I Can’t Believe I Did That</a>.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

But there’s one word that doesn’t come up that often is <em>game</em>. This is probably for the same reason people invented the term <em>graphic novel</em> — <em>comic book</em> sounds a little too kidlike and, well, light-hearted. Games imply a certain superficiality… and for good reason. The overall audience for video games has aged a little bit, to the mid-twenties if not early thirties, but the bottom of the demographic is still somewhere around ten years old. Even so, it’s a pretty narrow range. You don’t really think of Dickens as a males 18-24 kind of writer.</p>\n<p>But you can’t really deny that video games provide a ton of examples of how interaction can work structurally. When I think about how I want a story to work, it’s games like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, where what seem like innocuous choices determine how the plot’s resolved, that give me signposts.</p>\n<p>(That’s another reason I think there’s a bias against games in serious analysis… you just sound dumb citing something like <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> in what’s supposed to be a serious paper.)</p>\n<p>The thing that video games have been consistently terrible at, though, is provoking an emotional response through interaction. Fanboys typically talk about <a href="http://www.bowenresearch.com/studies.php?id=3">Aeris biting the dust</a> in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> as a huge emotional moment… but hey, characters have been dying melodramatically since forever!

It sounds silly and it shouldn’t. It’s sort of a successor to the classic Atari 2600 game <a href="http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=964">Adventure</a>, where you play a humble squire whose goal is to retrieve an item (a chalice in Adventure, an amulet in Dragonstomper) from an evil dragon. The way there is unclear — there’s a whole countryside to explore, with castles to raid and evil spiders to slay, a town where supplies can be purchased, and finally a tunnel that is going to do its damnedest to kill you before you reach the dragon’s lair.</p>\n<p>My dad and I would play Atari games together all the time when I was a little kid. Simple lovely games like Ice Hockey and Grand Prix. But Dragonstomper was his game — it used an add-on for the 2600 called the <a href="http://www.atariage.com/company_page.html?SystemID=2600&amp;CompanyID=32">Supercharger</a> that stored games on audio cassettes, and only he knew how to hook it up correctly.</p>\n<p>So I got to play sidekick as my dad built up his character’s strength, recruited villagers for his quest, and eventually, after a lot of effort, reached the dragon. The dragon itself was terrifying — it was about three hundred times as big as your humble squire sprite and got to take three attacks for every one you got. Every step he took was accompanied by a menacing Atari 2600 ditty. It felt like every second counted when you fought the dragon.</p>\n<p>It fascinated me, the whole game. There seemed to be so many rules working behind the scenes, so many things I didn’t understand — I mean, when you drank a potion, all that would happen was a message reading “FEELS WEIRD” would appear on-screen. What was it doing to you? Could it kill you? Would something happen if you drank more potions?</p>\n<p>The thing was, though my dad could get to the dragon pretty reliably after maybe 45 minutes of playing, he always got dragon-stomped. Sometimes he lasted a long time in the battle — there was no way to tell how close he came to slaying the dragon, though. The brave, dumb warriors he had recruited from the town died off one by one, and then there was nothing to do but wait for the hollow dirge that accompanied the “YOU HAVE DIED” message.</p>\n<p>Maybe we would have just written it off if it hadn’t been for this sentence in the <a href="http://www.atariage.com/manual_page.html?SystemID=2600&amp;SoftwareLabelID=155&amp;ItemTypeID=&amp;currentPage=9&amp;maxPages=12">manual</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The clever Dragonstomper™</em> can prove he is smarter than the dragon by outwitting him and stealing the amulet. The dragon can then be rehabilitated instead of killed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The instructions also explained that the amulet was what turned the dragon evil, that somehow it affected its mind. So it obsessed us, the idea of winning without killing the dragon. It made sense — you couldn’t just kill your way through the first level, either. There was a guard blocking the way to the village who was too strong to be fought. You could either bribe him (so the manual claimed — we never did this) or you could present him with identity papers that were hidden in one of the castles. He would then let you through without a fight.</p>\n<p>My dad tried all kinds of things to get the dragon to snap out of the trance the amulet had put him under. He tried feeding it the medicine we were supposed to use to cure ourselves when we were hit by poison traps. He gave it elixir, too, because we never figured out what that did or how it was different from regular medicine. He tried to distract it with rubies and sapphires purchased in town. He tried avoiding fighting the dragon entirely and making a dash for the amulet.</p>\n<p>Nothing worked. And … eventually we gave up, and I grew up.</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s better to never find out what happens when you win. To dream what it would have meant instead of actually winning. To fall asleep and have that girl kiss you … the endings we invent may be better than the ones we live.</p>\n<p>The words seem hollow to me as I write them. The singsong of a loser who’s happy to be a loser.</p>\n<p>Today I opened an <a href="http://stella.sourceforge.net/">Atari 2600 emulator</a> and started playing for real. I was armed with the best tools the 21st century could give me. A <a href="http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/dragonstomper/dragonstomper.htm">halfway decent guide</a> on the Internet that explains what all the items do, and the ability to save my game at any point and reload every time I screwed up.</p>\n<p>Just a few minutes ago, the game told me “YOU KILLED THE DRAGON.” I moved my little squire avatar up the screen to claim the amulet, half-expecting one more challenge, one more monster, one final puzzle, and then …</p>\n<p>Well, I won.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://chrisklimas.com/blog/2004-11-15-the-otherworld-of-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas','The otherworld of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas',replace('<p><em>I originally wrote this post for <a href="http://crunchable.net/articles/?p=188">Crunchable.net</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The night I unlocked the second city of <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/grandtheftautosanandreas/">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, I dreamed of being a year younger, going to my sister’s college graduation. But it was in Baltimore City this time, and I wandered onto the streets into an apartment building just because it looked interesting to me.</p>\n<p>Inside, there was a man who was a painter, and he had three children to take care of — somehow I knew that none of them were biologically his, though I didn’t know how he had acquired these kids. He was kind of fat in that friendly sort of way, and had a beard, too. He seemed like he had never even thought of being worried about life. His painting was too important. He was teaching his oldest the beginnings of his craft; he gave him a bucket of red paint and let him do what we wanted to his studio walls.</p>\n<p>He took me to a room with a mirror and said: “This is what we call the otherworld.” And then the mirror was not a mirror anymore. It was a window.</p>\n<p>When you buy a video game, you are buying a world to live in. A separate one. People who are afraid of the concept call it escapism. But do you think the world could be better than it is right now? Do you think about how it could be better? (Do you already know?) Then you’re an escapist.</p>\n<p>What puzzles me sometimes is the worlds people choose to escape into. <a href="http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=240">Counter-Strike</a>, for instance — probably the most popular game people play online — is like a recurring nightmare. Either you are a terrorist without an ideal, just a desire to blow things up or hold people hostage, or you are a counter-terrorist that has at most 20 minutes (usually, anyway — it is up to God, should anyone choose to take that role actively, to decide) to prevent all these terrible things from happening. And your reward for saving the world, for being a hero? Better guns, being able to kill people more easily.</p>\n<p>The beginning of GTA: San Andreas could be called a nightmare too. You don’t realize it until you’ve left it behind, but the city you start in, Los Santos (a pastiche of Los Angeles), is permanently plagued by an awful orange filter. Smog. Buy yourself a bright red T-shirt, and it becomes the color of dried blood outside. You are brought here by your mother’s death. She was an innocent caught in the crossfire of a random gang shooting — or so you believe. Only two members of your family are still alive: your brother Sweet and your sister Kendl. The gang your brother runs has fallen on hard times — barely has enough territory to call home.</p>\n<p>The city is at war. Gang members are on nearly every street corner, and unless they are your blood brothers, they hate you. The beginning of the game is training in how to survive this war, and how to begin to fight back. Spending hours at a gym so that you can kill people quickly with your bare hands. Making contact with an old crazy guy who will outfit you with guns for free. Killing a gang member who has defected to your gang’s rival.</p>\n<p>You become used to the brutality of it. You embrace it, even. You plot how to take the block of town that contains both the gym and a fast food place from your enemies, because these things take on value to you. You lay traps, you stockpile weapons — you do drive-bys without any sense of irony. You own a beach house in the southwest corner of the city, away from the turf wars, but you don’t visit it very often. You can’t find a reason to.</p>\n<p>And then you are exiled, and then you are free in San Fierro. It’s meant to be a take-off on San Francisco: the hills are steep and the streets are, for the most part, laid out logically. Fast-food workers are polite and probably high as kites, and the prostitutes who wander the streets at night, the ones anti-escapists pin their hatred upon, look like Britney Spears. There seem to be gangs on the street — by now you have been trained in how to pick them out at a distance — but they don’t know who you are, and so they are happy to let you be an ordinary citizen.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know why I never came here before,” Carl, the person you become inside GTA: San Andreas, says. You are thinking the same exact thing.</p>\n<p>The GTA series has always been a mirror. But it isn’t a mirror of the real world. That’s what the <a href="http://www.halflife2.net/forums/archive/index.php/t-94088.html">anti-escapists</a> never figure out. It’s a mirror of your own self. You can kill prostitutes in this game. You can kill cops in this game. You can kill innocent old women just walking to the market. You can point guns at people and just wait as they stare at you, their hands in their air — and for no reason at all, you shoot them in the head, maybe take their money. You can rob people’s homes as they sleep. You can steal a car and improvise a roadblock on the highway. Wait for a bunch of cars to show up, all honking their horns at a driver they can’t see isn’t there. Toss a grenade into the middle and watch the mayhem.</p>\n<p>But it’s your choice to do all this.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can be a policeman. You can be a paramedic. You can even work as a valet, if you want, or a taxi cab driver. You can observe stop lights. You can run a triathlon. You can find mysterious things going on in the countryside. And — in the weirdest turn in the series so far — you can get a girlfriend whose trust must be earned slowly. You can take driving lessons, even.</p>\n<p>GTA: San Andreas has taken the series beyond the mirror: it is an otherworld. You can play it as a game, with missions to complete and secrets to catalog, but its true achievement is that you can be happy just playing, not worrying about points or progress. Just existing inside it is fascinating.</p>\n','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','','Chris Klimas blog (creator of Twine, an IF language)','',NULL,'2023-12-05 03:18:22','read');

That time when you&rsquo;re eagerly awaiting IFComp games, which can be frustrating, or *writing* your IFComp game, which is *work*. But it&rsquo;s also the time when we begin seeking donations for the Colossal Fund.<br/><br/>\n\nNow in its fifth year, the Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries (more on how that’s calculated below). Last year, our community donated $8500, $6800 of which was given to the authors of 68 IFComp entries. The remaining funds, last year and in the year to come, provide support for the programs and projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>We&rsquo;re now accepting donations for 2021!</b><br/>The donation button is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on <a href="https://ifcomp.org/about/colossal/">our donor page</a> (or listed as &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; if you prefer)! Our fundraising deadline is November 15th. As usual, 80% of the proceeds ($6800 if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. <br/><br/>\n\n<b>What does this mean for authors?</b><br/>Because we&rsquo;re dividing the money among the top finishers, the exact numbers depend on how many IFComp entries there are. If we figure on 100 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 66 of them. If we reach our target of $8500, the prize chart will look like this:<br/><br/>\n\n</p><center><table border="1">\n<tr><td> 1: $284.88</td><td>18: $160.71</td><td>35: $73.57</td><td>52: $23.47</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 2: $276.55</td><td>19: $154.56</td><td>36: $69.60</td><td>53: $21.68</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 3: $268.35</td><td>20: $148.54</td><td>37: $65.76</td><td>54: $20.01</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 4: $260.28</td><td>21: $142.64</td><td>38: $62.04</td><td>55: $18.47</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 5: $252.33</td><td>22: $136.88</td><td>39: $58.45</td><td>56: $17.06</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 6: $244.51</td><td>23: $131.24</td><td>40: $54.99</td><td>57: $15.78</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 7: $236.83</td><td>24: $125.73</td><td>41: $51.66</td><td>58: $14.63</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 8: $229.27</td><td>25: $120.35</td><td>42: $48.46</td><td>59: $13.60</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 9: $221.83</td><td>26: $115.09</td><td>43: $45.38</td><td>60: $12.71</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 10: $214.53</td><td>27: $109.97</td><td>44: $42.44</td><td>61: $11.94</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 11: $207.35</td><td>28: $104.97</td><td>45: $39.62</td><td>62: $11.30</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 12: $200.31</td><td>29: $100.10</td><td>46: $36.93</td><td>63: $10.78</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 13: $193.39</td><td>30: $95.36</td><td>47: $34.36</td><td>64: $10.40</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 14: $186.59</td><td>31: $90.74</td><td>48: $31.93</td><td>65: $10.14</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 15: $179.93</td><td>32: $86.26</td><td>49: $29.62</td><td>66: $10.02</td></tr>\n<tr><td> 16: $173.40</td><td>33: $81.90</td><td>50: $27.44</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td> 17: $166.99</td><td>34: $77.67</td><td>51: $25.39</td><td></td></tr>\n</table></center><br/>\n\nThe numbers add up to $6800, which is 80% of $8500.<br/><br/>As you see, this is not a winner-take-all plan. Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well should receive a decent prize.<br/><br/>\n\nLet&rsquo;s see&hellip; what other questions might you have?<br/><br/>\n\n<b>How do I donate?</b><br/>Please go to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/about/prizes">our site</a> and push the big blue Donate button.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Is my donation tax-deductible?<br/></b>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional, that&rsquo;s all we can say.)<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?<br/></b>Nope! These cash prizes will be <i>in addition to</i> the usual IFComp prize list. Please visit our <a href="https://ifcomp.org/about/prizes">prize page</a> to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?<br/></b>Via PayPal. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can&rsquo;t accept PayPal, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn&rsquo;t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year&rsquo;s prize fund.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Was any money rolled into this year&rsquo;s fund from last year?<br/></b>Yes! Some of last year&rsquo;s winners declined their prizes. So we are starting the 2021 CF fund with $556 already in the pot.','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2021-08-17 02:37:38','IF Competition Blog','',NULL,'2023-12-05 17:39:14','read');

Entries are due September 28th.</p><p>Returning authors will notice some updates to the registration form, such as the ability to define the system used to develop web-based games. Additionally, there is now a more formal way of designating co-authors, which will allow them to participate in the Miss Congeniality side contest (a special authors-only voting pool to rate the work of other authors in the competition).</p><p>We’re also going to try a big experiment this year! Many members of our community have expressed concern about the increasingly smaller author-to-judge ratio, as more and more of you have been entering as authors these past few years.  In 2021, we will allow authors to also be judges. Yep, you read right: everyone can vote on (almost) all the games. Authors won’t be able to cast a vote for their own games, but they’ll be able to vote on everything else, and the Miss Congeniality side contest will be unchanged. This rule will be reviewed after the 2021 competition, with feedback sought from the community, prior to permanent adoption.</p><p>So, if you’ve been itchin’ to enter, visit <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">https://ifcomp.org/</a> to register.</p>',NULL,'','2021-07-01 04:46:32','IF Competition Blog','',NULL,'2023-12-05 17:39:14','read');

Conversely, a judge who did not or could not make a good-faith effort to play a certain game must not submit a rating for that game. The competition organizers reserve the right to disqualify any ratings that appear to have been submitted under any other circumstances.</p></blockquote><p>More than three ballots were strongly scrutinized due to this rule, but only three ballots were deemed so clear-cut as to merit disqualification. <br/><br/>98.75% of ballots were accepted and used to calculate the final scores.<br/></p>',NULL,'','2020-12-08 16:44:52','IF Competition Blog','',NULL,'2023-12-05 17:39:14','read');

Votes in the Authors Choice competition are public but anonymized.\r\n</P>\r\n\r\nEligibility to vote in the Authors Choice competition is determined by having a game linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page and use the Link to Authors Profile feature. Authors added incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if someone associates a random game they didnt make to their account).\r\n</P>\r\nRules for discussion and voting\r\n<br>\r\n-Voting must be in good faith and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br>\r\n\r\n-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the above rule.<br>\r\n\r\n-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br>\r\n\r\n-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after warning.<br>\r\n\r\n-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesnt encourage people to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if they havent played it).\r\n</P>\r\n\r\nCode of conduct\r\n</P>\r\n-Voters must abide by the <A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>. Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.\r\n</P>\r\nModeration\r\n-Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.\r\n</P>\r\nEligibility\r\n-For most polls, games are eligible if they are listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2022.<br>\r\n\r\n-For system- or genre-specific polls, games additionally must have the appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the specified field.<br>\r\n\r\n-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing eligible games.<br>\r\n\r\n-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However, malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br>\r\n\r\n-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging the organizer (me, for now).<br>\r\n\r\n-The organizers games are eligible for the players choice awards, but not the authors choice awards.\r\n</P>\r\nResults\r\n\r\n-Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll. However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br>\r\n\r\n-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5 votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture of Awards\r\n</P>\r\nOne of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned and regular. They need to keep working even if I dont keep working.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the polls themselves.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50% voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public veto.','\r',char(13)),'\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-01-31 15:57:12','IF Database News','',NULL,'2023-12-05 17:52:24','read');

That was the question that Carl Zimmer set out to answer in his most recent book, <a href="https://carlzimmer.com/books/lifes-edge/" target="_blank">Life&rsquo;s Edge: The Search For What It Means To Be Alive</a>. Most dictionary definitions of the word &quot;alive&quot; define it as in opposition to being dead. For example, &quot;(of a person, animal, or plant) living, not dead.&quot; This doesn&#39;t answer the question about the edge cases, such as viruses, which &quot;have long been a real puzzle for biologists about whether they&#39;re alive or not. They have incredible screaming matches about whether these things are alive or not. And they have been doing so for a century, since they discovered viruses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists have attempted to define life, though they don&#39;t all agree. &quot;There are definitions of life, that actually have been published by scientists and scientific journals. I say definitions, there are several hundred definitions. And the number doesn&#39;t seem to be going down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems obvious to most people what is alive or dead, but Carl looked into this from a scientific perspective. &quot;How do you know whether something&#39;s alive or not? Are you relying on actual scientific observation? Or is it more of an intuition? I would argue that we mostly are just relying on intuition, whether things are alive or not, whether people are alive or not. And sometimes, there are things that can completely overturn our intuitions, things that are in a borderland between life and death, between life and nonlife. The more that you explore that gray zone, you start to realize that we really don&#39;t understand life at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of defining life isn&#39;t that old; scientists and philosophers only started exploring it in the 18th century. &quot;What was happening was that you had a scientific revolution that had changed how we think about inanimate objects. Because we have physics, we can think about matter in motion. This raised important questions about our own bodies. What about ourselves? What about animals and plants? It seemed like there was something that was fundamentally different between a rock and a flower, and that something was life. But again, that doesn&#39;t really tell you what life is. So in the 1700s, there were a lot of ideas put forward about how life was all about some sort of vital force. There were forces in the universe of gravity and so on, but there was some other force, a vital force, and that vital force was inside living things. And that allowed living things to do things that other objects could not, to grow, to become complex, to reproduce, to make new copies of themselves that are almost identical. All these things were made possible by this vital force. And again, nobody could actually say what the vital force was. But this whole view became known as vitalism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl Zimmer is not a scientist, and got into science writing by the back door. After an English major in college, he went to work at a science magazine. &quot;I just happened to get an entry-level job as an assistant copy editor at a magazine that happened to be about science. I started working on the stories, and I thought, this is really interesting, I&#39;m really enjoying this. Then I had the opportunity to grow in a position to start fact-checking, writing, editing, and so on. Discover magazine was a really great education, and I was there for 10 years in total. But you certainly just don&#39;t wake up one day and become a science writer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we were chatting over Zoom, I noticed a table with several dozen books piled up. Carl told me these were the remnants of the books he researched for his current project. He enters all his research into his Scrivener project. &quot;Scrivener has been essential for me. I started working seriously with Scrivener in 2016. I had written a number of books already by that point, and there were a lot of things that were painful about writing books. For example, you know, just organizing all the reference material that you need for a book, and then organizing the book itself. So I would make do largely with Microsoft Word. Word is fine for shorter things, but it was a real hassle for working on big projects like books. Once I figured out how Scrivener works, and how it would work for me; I think I&#39;m a visual person. So it really helps me to be able to see the pieces of the book and scan up and down very quickly. When I&#39;ve been working with editors, often their best guidance has been very structural, like saying this part doesn&#39;t belong here, these chapters are out of order, these chapters should be split, or these chapters should be fused, and so on. What I like with Scrivener is that you can do that just by dragging around the different parts of the book. And then you can look at&nbsp;it in terms of the sections and then just read it in that new order. Just having that ability to move the pieces around in Scrivener makes it incredibly valuable to me.&quot;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

Writing is a lonely task, and it&rsquo;s important to find people you can trust to share their opinions on your work. For the most part, these beta readers can give you general feedback about a novel. But they can&rsquo;t help you with more specific elements that require specialist knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re writing about a specific profession or time period, you get everything right. If you make mistakes, it&rsquo;s likely that many if not most readers won&rsquo;t notice it, but you&rsquo;ll certainly hear from those who are familiar with a certain subject or profession who will gleefully correct you.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/expertsjpg.jpg" alt=""  />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Many writers of crime fiction befriend police officers and use them as sounding boards to ensure that the descriptions of police activities in their books are correct. If you write science fiction, you may want to find beta readers who can critique the use and description of science in your novel, real or imagined. And if you write a historical novel, it can be helpful to get a real historian, who is familiar with your setting, to give your manuscript a once over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many books written for writers describing police procedures, forensics, and legal processes, and there are books about certain historical periods for writers. But let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re writing a novel where air traffic controllers are important to the story. It may not be easy to find the kind of documentation that you need that explains how they work. Or what if you&rsquo;re writing a romance novel set on a cruise ship? You may have taken cruises, and you may know enough about how it feels to be a guest on one of those ships, but it can be useful to know what goes on behind the scenes, because this could help you create interesting plot points, or introduce characters from the crew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should check everything that you can on your own, using reference books and online tools, on your novel during the final editing stage. Start by going through your manuscript or draft and highlighting the elements that need to be checked. You may need to check things like place names or the descriptions of specific places, and these can all be found using tools like Google Maps. To ensure that you&rsquo;ve described real places correctly, you can use Google Street View, which lets you see exactly what many locations look like, allowing you to provide detailed descriptions without taking trips to do research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other types of fact-checking, there are many resources available online. You can look up specific topics in academic journals and authoritative websites related to specific subjects, and Wikipedia is quite good as well. (But don&rsquo;t blindly trust what you read there; follow the sources cited, and make sure they are reliable.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the subject you&rsquo;re dealing with, it may be enough to do some online research, as long as you don&rsquo;t go into too much detail. When you have more than you can find, you can try reaching out to experts in the fields you discuss. You can find people like this through professional networks, social media platforms, or online forums, and you may even find some in writing communities such as Goodreads; there are lots of writers who have expertise from their careers and who would be willing to share. In some cases, you may only have a few questions, and these can be answered quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where things can get more complicated are not so much the facts but the way people work, or the way specific objects work. For example, there is a very popular writer of thrillers who spends pages and pages talking about the guns used, yet who has been criticized for not understanding how specific guns work. This doesn&rsquo;t bother most readers, but people who know about guns end up distrusting this author. A bit of research, and the help of an expert, might have avoided disdain from people familiar with guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fact-checking can take a certain amount of time, even for experts. When you contact someone, explain the premise of your novel and the specific information you need to verify. Provide a brief summary of your story and explain what you would like them to review. In many cases, you may just want a few facts to be checked, but some novels may require more attention, and this may be difficult for busy professionals. But some experts might be avid readers, and relish the idea of helping out an author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve found someone willing to help you, send them excerpts or sections from your novel that you want vetted. Highlight specific statements, events, or details that you want them to review, so they can focus on the areas that need attention. In some cases, it won&rsquo;t take long for an expert to look over a few dozen sentences and confirm whether you got things right or not. But sometimes, checking the behavior of people as they do a specific type of work, throughout a novel, requires a more thorough read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to provide a reasonable timeframe to review your queries. Remember that these professionals are often busy and may not be able to read a manuscript as quickly as you need, so it&rsquo;s important to agree to a schedule. One suggestion is to find experts in the field you need fact-checked who are retired, and who may have more time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s lots to do when finishing up a novel, and fact-checking may not be high on your task list. But it&rsquo;s an important element of the final editing process, and getting facts wrong can annoy the readers who spot mistakes.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/why-writers-should-learn-how-to-touch-type','Why Writers Should Learn How to Touch Type',replace(replace('\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Writers type a lot; it&rsquo;s the nature of the craft. While there are other options, such as writing longhand then typing after you&rsquo;ve finished a draft, or <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/write-with-your-voice-how-to-use-dictation-with-scrivener" target="_blank">dictating to your computer</a>, most writers spend a lot of time typing. Typing is a skill, and learning to touch type can be beneficial for all writers. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started working as a freelance translator in 1996, I decided that I should learn to touch type. I realized that my income was directly related to the number of words that I was able to type, and thought that if I could type more quickly and more effortlessly, I would be able to earn more money. At the time, I found a program for Mac designed for children who needed to learn to type. I dutifully went through the exercises in this program, as if I was learning scales on a musical instrument. I printed out a small piece of paper with the keyboard layout and pasted it on my monitor, and forced myself to not look at the keyboard. It took a few months, but since then, I have been able to touch type efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you learn to touch type, you&rsquo;ll be able to type faster, and you&rsquo;ll be able to get your ideas onto the virtual page more quickly and more efficiently. Since you don&rsquo;t have to keep looking at the keyboard, you can focus on your writing, and get into a creative flow that&rsquo;s not interrupted by looking alternately at the screen and the keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That flow idea is important. Some writers like to think and write very slowly, but others like to try to write as quickly as thoughts come to them. If you can touch type, you can write using either of these techniques: a few words at a time with pauses, or extended periods where you are easily transposing your thoughts onto your computer screen, or the sheet of paper in your typewriter, if you go the old-fashioned route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you touch type, you also type more accurately. Instead of looking at the keyboard and thinking where each key is, you&rsquo;ll be able to concentrate on what you&rsquo;re writing, focusing on the words, the punctuation, rhythms of the sentences, rather than on hitting the right keys. If you make fewer mistakes, you&rsquo;ll save time on proofreading and editing, and your work will be more polished. As you learn to touch type, and make mistakes, you can benefit from your computer&rsquo;s built-in spell checker and predictive text to help you out. (On Windows, this is called <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-text-suggestions-in-windows-0bf313ca-c992-4173-aa5f-8341d3953498" target="_blank">Text Suggestions</a>; on macOS Sonoma or later, this is called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2299/14.0/mac/14.0" target="_blank">Inline Predictive Text</a>.) In fact, over time, you will find that&nbsp;combining touch typing with these predictive text features will save you even more time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re writing fiction, you&rsquo;re probably not worried about how quickly you write your words. But if you are also writing work for paid publication, such as articles, you&rsquo;ll find that touch typing saves you a lot of time. This time that you save will allow you to produce work more quickly and meet deadlines more easily. It will also give you more time to think about what you&rsquo;re writing and produce better content. Typing faster can also be beneficial when you&rsquo;re working on a tight deadline or during periods of inspiration when you don&rsquo;t want to be slowed down by hunting and pecking on the keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning to touch type can also be good for your body. Working on computers can be stressful, and poor habits can lead you to develop repetitive strain injuries (RSI) such as carpal tunnel syndrome, especially if you&rsquo;re only using a couple of fingers on each hand. Touch typing shares the work across all eight fingers, instead of just one or two on each hand. Touch typing also helps you develop a relaxed hand and wrist position, reducing strain and minimizing potential long-term damage. When you type without looking at the keyboard, you will also be able to maintain better posture, promoting better overall physical well-being. This is particularly important if you type on a laptop where the keyboard is very close to the computer&rsquo;s screen. You&rsquo;ll likely have less neck, shoulder, and back pain from not hunching over your keyboard, and this can allow you to think more freely about what you write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many websites that can help you learn to touch type. Two examples are <a href="https://www.typing.com/student/lessons" target="_blank">typing.com</a>, which offers graded lessons starting with the basics, and <a href="https://www.typingstudy.com" target="_blank">Touch Typing Study</a>, which lets you choose from a number of languages, as well various keyboard layouts. When I learned to touch type, I decided to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout" target="_blank">Dvorak layout</a>, which, according to many articles I had read, was more efficient than the standard QWERTY layout.

So even though it sounds boring, there was a lot of interesting stuff that I did day to day in terms of business strategy. Writing was a passion that I had since I was young, but I grew up not thinking that that was a real job. I didn&#39;t know any authors; the fantasy that I enjoyed was all the epic medieval European fantasies in the vein of Tolkien and Jordan. I had a pipe dream, that it would be really fun one day to try and write novels. But I didn&#39;t really get down to it until I was in my early 30s. I had reached the point in my business career where I had to decide what to do next.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee took a pragmatic approach to making the switch. &quot;I started signing up for writing classes, and going to conferences, and developing a writing practice. One thing led to another and I set myself a goal of writing an entire novel manuscript in a year. So I did that, and that was sort of a practice novel that didn&#39;t go anywhere. And then I wrote another one and queried it. And that didn&#39;t get picked up. And then I wrote another one. And that became my debut novel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that point on, Lee realized that she could have a writing career, but didn&#39;t quit her day job right away. She offloaded some of her work, and then switched to part-time. &quot;Eventually as the writing career started to take off, I quit, and then went freelance as a business consultant, and then eventually made a switch into full-time writing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most fantasy, there is magic in Lee&#39;s <em>Green Bone Saga</em>, but it&#39;s magic that comes from a natural resource: jade. &quot;I have a particular keenness for <em>low magic</em>, magic that doesn&#39;t feel especially magical or is very much a normal part of day-to-day life. There are fantasy stories where magic is beyond human comprehension. There may be rules to it, but it comes from some cosmic power, or even your divine power. I enjoy writing speculative fiction where there is that turn into the speculative, but that feels very true to life. And one in which the characters don&#39;t even really see the magic as being especially magical. It&#39;s just part of their world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fantasy fiction has changed a lot since its rise in popularity in the 1960s, when Tolkien&#39;s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> became widely read. &quot;I think we really are in a fantastic period for the expansion of fantasy. It has grown so much in terms of what it encompasses, with inspirations coming from different time periods, different parts of the world, and different genres. And I feel like the fences around the genre have broken down. But I think there&#39;s a perception among the mainstream public or lay readers who aren&#39;t as familiar with the genre that it is still a certain thing. I think it just hasn&#39;t quite gotten there, perhaps with the general reading public, but those of us who are in the genre who work in it every day, we see so much change. I don&#39;t think <em>The Green Bone Saga</em> would have been, you know, published even 10 years ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Green Bone Saga</em> is a trilogy, which is a popular form for fantasy novels. I asked Lee if she had planned on writing a trilogy. &quot;I did not know it&#39;d be a trilogy, because I wrote it on spec. I did not have a book deal for it. I wrote the first book, knowing that it could be a larger series, but not knowing if it would sell. So it was only after I managed to get a deal for the first book that my publisher said, &#39;I would like a trilogy.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fonda Lee has written all her novels with Scrivener. &quot;Everything goes into Scrivener. I always start with a folder that&#39;s research. I import web pages into Scrivener. If I find some article that&#39;s interesting, I port that in. I save images as oftentimes they&#39;re character inspirations. And I throw in whatever interesting bits of information I find in my research folder. Then I&#39;ve always got another folder that&#39;s developmental work. I start a new bit of text that might be a character brainstorm, a magic system, or a setting. I do research and brainstorming development for several weeks, and then an outline. So I start a new file that will be the first draft outline, and I start outlining. When it gets to the actual writing process, I usually port my outline into a series of text files. And so I take that outline, and then break it down and set out my chapters and just start working. Once I get into it I just use Composition Mode.&quot;</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.

Most apps that work with text allow you to customise the font and the size of the text you type. But Scrivener goes much further, allowing you to customise many parts of the app&#39;s interface. This is especially useful for people whose vision isn&rsquo;t 20/20, and who need to increase the size of certain interface elements for ease of use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, I&#39;m going to explain how you can customise fonts in many areas of Scrivener&rsquo;s interface.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise what you type\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, most word processors and text editors allow you to customise the text that you type. Scrivener gives you a great deal of flexibility in this area, letting you tweak the font, the size, the line spacing, borders, and much more. See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/customize-the-scrivener-editor-2-adjusting-fonts-in-the-editor" target="_blank">Customize the Scrivener Editor 2 - Adjusting Fonts in the Editor</a> to learn all the options in the Editor.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise fonts in the Binder\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivener also lets you customise the fonts in the Binder; that&#39;s the sidebar at the left of the Scrivener window, which shows you the files and folders that make up your project. You may want to increase the size of this font if the default is hard to see, or decrease it if you have a large number of items in the Binder, and want to see them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To change the setting, go to Scrivener &gt; Settings &gt; Appearance (Mac) or File &gt; Options (Windows). Click the Appearance tab. Most of the settings in the rest of this article are accessed from here.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/fonts1.png" alt="" width="767" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Click Binder in the sidebar of the Settings / Options window, then click Fonts. Choose the font and size you want to use, and choose if you want folders or document groups to be bolded.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise Corkboard fonts\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/fonts2.png" alt="" width="608" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>There are two places where you can customise fonts for the Corkboard. Again in the Appearance tab of Settings / Options, click Corkboard to change the font for photographs and status stamps. Click Index Cards to change the fonts for the cards that display on the Corkboard; you can change the font and size of index card titles and texts.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise the Editor Header bar font\r\n\r\n<p>While you saw how to customize fonts in the editor, at the beginning of this article, there is another element of the editor that you can tweak: the Header Bar. This is the strip above the text you type, and below the toolbar, which has menus to select fonts, styles, line spacing, and more. By default, the font size of the Header Bar is quite small to keep it unobtrusive. But if you use the Header Bar often, you might want to increase the size or change the font.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to the Appearance tab of Settings / Options, then click Main Editor, then Fonts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with all the Header Bar can do, see <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-the-format-bar-header-bar-and-ruler-in-scriveners-editor" target="_blank">How to Use the Format Bar, Header Bar, and Ruler in Scrivener&#39;s Editor</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise fonts in the Outliner\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/fonts3.png" alt="" width="767" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>The Outliner offers a lot of options for fonts: you can customise titles, synopses, other texts, and you can choose whether you want folder and document group titles to display in bold text. Go to the Appearance tab, then click Outliner, then Fonts.</p>\r\n\r\nScrivenings font settings\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivenings view is how Scrivener displays texts without breaks when you select multiple items in the Binder. You can learn how to use this in <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/view-and-edit-multiple-documents-with-scrivenings" target="_blank">View and Edit Multiple Documents with Scrivenings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrivenings view using the Editor&#39;s font settings, but you can also tweak the font for Scrivenings titles, and more, in Appearance &gt; Scrivenings.</p>\r\n\r\nCustomise font colors in Composition Mode\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Composition Mode - which is Scrivener&#39;s full-screen mode that hides many of the app&#39;s interface elements - fonts display as you have set them up in the Editor. However, you can change the colors of these fonts. You may want to do this because the editor displays surrounded by a background, rather than above your computer&#39;s wallpaper or desktop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you choose Appearance &gt; Composition Mode &gt; Colors, you have options to change the color of texts in the Editor (use the Text setting in the sidebar; the Editor color setting changes the background color) and Scrivenings titles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;ll also note that many of the options in the Appearance settings allow you to change the colors of various elements of the Scrivener interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/distraction-free-writing-with-scrivener" target="_blank">Distraction-Free Writing with Scrivener</a> to learn how to use Composition Mode.</p>\r\n\r\nSaving your custom settings\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to use certain settings sometimes, and other settings at other times, depending on what you&#39;re working on and how complex your projects are. At the bottom of the Settings / Options window is a Manage menu. This allows you to save settings as a preset, so you can change among different settings with a couple of clicks.

You might compile your project to send it to an agent, editor, or a friend who&#39;s going to read your manuscript. <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/compiling-your-scrivener-project-the-basics" target="_blank">Scrivener&#39;s compile feature</a> is quite powerful, and gives you many options about how your project is assembled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you may also want to export some or all of your Scrivener project. You can do this in several ways, for various reasons. In this article, we will explain how to export a Scrivener project, and when this feature can be useful.</p>\r\n\r\nExporting files\r\n\r\n<p>There are a couple of reasons why you might want to export files from your project&#39;s Binder. One reason would be to create a backup of your project. While <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-back-up-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">Scrivener regularly and automatically backs up your projects</a>, it never hurts to have additional backups. You can export your entire manuscript to a folder, which contains all the items in your Binder: files, folders, subfolders, images, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might also want to export individual files, if you&#39;re collaborating with a co-author, or if you want to send a single file to an agent, editor, or friend for them to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To export files, select an item, then choose File &gt; Export &gt; Files, then choose a location to save it on your drive. If you have selected a single file in the Binder, Scrivener will export that file. If you&#39;ve selected a folder, or the top-level folder, Scrivener will export the contents of that folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can export files in many formats, including:\r\nRichText (.rtf), Microsoft Word (.doc or. docx), FinalDraft (.fdx), PlainText (.txt), and MultiMarkdown (.md).</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/export1.png" alt="" width="900" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>If you export an individual file, Scrivener will save that file. If you export a folder, you&#39;ll see that it reproduces the file and folder structure of the Binder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Export dialog presents a number of options: you can choose to save <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/working-with-notes-in-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">notes</a>, metadata, and <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-snapshots-in-scrivener-to-save-versions-of-your-projects" target="_blank">snapshots</a>, from the Metadata tab, and, from the Options tab, you can tell Scrivener to not export subdocuments, number exported files, and remove <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-annotations-comments-footnotes-in-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">comments and annotations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nExporting an OPML file\r\n\r\n<p>While <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">Scrivener has a built-in outlining feature</a>, some people like to work with outliners that offer more advanced options. You may also want to export the outline of your Scrivener project to send to an editor or agent. Scrivener can export your project to an OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) file, which <a href="http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml" target="_blank">most outliners support</a>. (Note that some other types of apps, such as RSS readers and podcast apps, also support OPML files, but not for outlining.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can then import this file into an outliner to view the outline in a different app from Scrivener, which might help you view your project differently, or let you view your outline in a different window while you&#39;re working on your manuscript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To export an OPML file, choose File &gt; Export &gt; OPML File, then choose a location to save it on your drive. There are several export options you can choose:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/export2.png" alt="" width="900" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>In most cases, you&#39;ll want to export Titles Only or Titles and Synopses. If you choose Titles and Text, this includes all the text in each item, converted to plain text. If you choose Titles and Notes, document notes are added to the OPML file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you choose the top option, Export Entire Binder, Scrivener will export everything in your Binder: your Character and Setting folders, Research folder, and everything in the Trash. You most likely don&#39;t want to do this.</p>\r\n\r\nExporting Outliner Contents as CSV\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to exporting your project as an OPML file to use with outlining apps, you can export the contents of the Scrivener Outliner as a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which you can open in a spreadsheet app, such as Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers, or a database app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To export Outliner contents, you must be in Outliner view: choose View &gt; Outline, or click the Outline button in the toolbar. (For more on using Scrivener&#39;s Outliner, <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">see this article</a>.) Choose File &gt; Export &gt; Outliner Contents as CSV, then select from the options in the dialog:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/export4.png" alt="" width="900" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>You can choose from three formats, using commas, tabs, or semi-colons to separate values; this choice depends on the software you want to import the file into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Scrivener exports the Outliner contents, it includes all the metadata available; if you want to limit this to the columns visible in the Scrivener Outliner, check Only include columns visible in outliner.</p>\r\n\r\nExporting Comments and Annotations\r\n\r\n<p>If you add comments and annotations to your Scrivener project, you might want to export them if you <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/printing-with-scrivener" target="_blank">print out your project</a> and start revising it. This way, you can access the comments and annotations easily as you make changes to your printout. You can also send these comments and annotations to an agent or editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To export comments and annotations, choose File &gt; Export &gt; Comments and Annotations. You have several options:</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <figure class="article__image">\n                    \n                        <img src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/export3.png" alt="" width="900" />\n                    \n                                    </figure>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>You can export comments and annotations for the selected documents only, you can include titles (if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s hard to see what the comments refer to), and you can include links to Scrivener sections. This latter option has clickable links that open each section where there are comments; this is useful if you&#39;re viewing the comments on a computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, exporting a Scrivener project is very different from compiling it. However there are many use cases where you may want to export your project.</p>\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                <p>Kirk McElhearn is a <a href="https://kirkville.com" target="_blank">writer</a>, <a href="https://kirkville.com/podcasts/" target="_blank">podcaster</a>, and <a href="https://kirkville.com/kirks-photos-2/" target="_blank">photographer</a>.
