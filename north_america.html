costs of Spain’s devastating floods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
From the BBC World Service: More than 200 people were killed in the
floods in Valencia, Spain — the worst in the country for decades. Now,
authorities are facing the massive task of reconstructing key roads and
tunnels that have been left in ruins. We’ll hear some of the
“incalculable” economic impacts. Then, added sugars in packaged baby
foods in the Philippines are raising flags for nutritional health
experts.

Yes, tomorrow is Election Day, the outcomes of which have the potential
to move markets. But don’t forget: We have a Federal Reserve meeting
this week too. On Thursday, the central bank will announce a decision on

were high hopes that the meeting would produce a roadmap for protecting
large swathes of land, water, and degraded ecosystems by 2030, but rich

nations’ efforts. “This COP was meant to be a status check on countries’

<li>Canada to propose plan to cap oil and gas emissions
</h3>
<p>
Canada, the fourth-largest oil producer in the world, will publish a
proposal today to cap greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel energy
production. Energy is Canada’s highest-polluting sector, with oil and
gas accounting for a quarter of all emissions and producing “more than
double the greenhouse gas pollution than all other industries combined,”
according to Hermine Landry, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister
Steven Guilbeault. Landry
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/canada-unveil-proposed-emissions-cap-oil-gas-sector-monday-2024-11-03/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_w5bHuGnm3BxbmeNfomJb2hs-MxSU7al-IInzGT7dCdFrgBjnvpV8MsPvYDLA4y3mckFUp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em><em>Reuters</em></em> that the cap-and-trade system would
incentivize high-emitting companies to invest in projects that reduce
pollution, though an earlier report from Deloitte

the cap would likely nudge companies to cut production. Canada has a
goal of curbing emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by the
end of the decade. Whether this new proposal comes into effect will
depend largely on the outcome of the next election, set to be held in
late 2025.

<h2 id="music-titan-quincy-jones-dies-at-91">Music titan Quincy Jones
dies at 91</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged
from producing Michael Jackson’s historic “Thriller” album to writing
prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank
Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died
at 91. </p>
<p>Jones’ publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his
home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his
family. </p>
<p>“Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our
father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing,” the family said in a
statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we
celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be
another like him.” </p>
<p>Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to
the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black
executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical
catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and
song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own
at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the
entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to
him. </p>
<p>Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars
and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with
Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for “Roots” and “In the Heat of the
Night,” organized President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural celebration
and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985
charity record for famine relief in Africa. </p>
<p>Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World” and was among the
featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.” </p>
<p>In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78
rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the
Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style
and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the
explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the
“King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop
’Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape
out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&amp;B and jazz and African chants. For
“Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones,
who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing
“Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the
title track. </p>
<p>“Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has
contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the
best-selling album of all time. </p>
<p>“If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers
fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said
in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t
just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill,
experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.” </p>
<p>The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001
autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an
honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also
received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the
Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to
American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up:
The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones.
His memoir made him a best-selling author.</p>

id="boeing-machinists-are-holding-a-contract-vote-that-could-end-their-7-week-strike">Boeing
machinists are holding a contract vote that could end their 7-week
strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to
accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted
more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger
planes.</p>
<p>A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace
giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If
members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing’s offer, it would plunge
the company into further financial peril and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38%
over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM
District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest,
endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the
machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently
declare victory,” the union district said in scheduling Monday’s vote.
“We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as
we have achieved so much success.”</p>
<p>Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though
negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected,
future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the
result of the vote Monday night.</p>
<p>Boeing has adamantly rejected requests to restore traditional
pensions that the company froze nearly a decade ago. Pensions were a key
issue for workers who voted down previous offers in September and
October.</p>
<p>If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by
Nov. 12, according to the union.</p>
<p>The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of
Boeing’s offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the
union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.</p>
<p>Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, but
still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported
a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer
received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making
Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.</p>
<p>Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would
rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.</p>
<p>In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract
includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the
previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k)
retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle
area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if
workers reject the new offer.</p>
<p>The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting
Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times,
including last week.</p>
<p>The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an
eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year
for the company.</p>
<p>Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug
blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.
Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they
said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at
the company.</p>
<p>The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737
Max. Two of the plane’s crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and
2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed
announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to
plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who
approved the 737 Max.</p>
<p>As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about
17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating
from being cut to junk status. S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings said last week
that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming
debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.</p>
<p>The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it
gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area
factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling
plane, and the 777 or “triple-seven” jet and the cargo-carrying version
of its 767 plane.</p>
<p>Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company
has too much debt, and “serious lapses in our performance” have
disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s
strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion
dollars.</p>

storms injure at least 11 and leave thousands without power</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY — Severe storms and tornadoes battered Oklahoma early
Sunday, tossing cars and ripping roofs off buildings in the middle of
the night and leaving tens of thousands of homes and businesses without
power. Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Much of the damage was reported in and around the state capital of
Oklahoma City, near the state’s center, but also scattered elsewhere
around the state. The early morning storms set off tornado warnings that
extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash
flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was
reported.</p>
<p>More than 99,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses lost power during the
overnight storms. By late Sunday afternoon, that number was reduced to
around 24,000. No fatalities had been reported.</p>
<p>Richard Thompson, forecast chief for the National Weather Service
Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said he believes six or more
tornadoes hit the state overnight. Meanwhile, forecasters warned state
residents to brace for more heavy rain and possible severe weather
through Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re not done with it yet,” he said.</p>
<p>A tornado watch for much of the central and southeast part of
Oklahoma was in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday. Other areas were under
thunderstorm or flood watches.</p>
<p>In the town of Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, firefighters and
police officers went door to door Sunday morning to ask about
injuries.</p>
<p>“It leveled a complete neighborhood in Choctaw,” the town’s mayor,
Chad Allcox, told The Associated Press. He added that debris hindered
search and rescue efforts. “Power lines are down everywhere … a lot of
the roads are blocked, hard to get through. Very large trees blocking
roadways.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman Scott Douglas told the AP
that heavy rain and the lingering threat of tornadoes in the early
morning darkness complicated early search and rescue efforts. He
described a first sweep of hard-hit areas around 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Emergency workers had to free two people from an overturned mobile
home, including a woman injured when an air conditioner landed on her
leg, Douglas said.</p>
<p>The scale of the damage came into focus as daylight broke. Local
television footage showed downed power lines, walls peeled off homes,
overturned vehicles and neighborhood streets littered with debris.</p>
<p>Douglas said 11 people were transported to hospitals with injuries
that were not life-threatening. “There were some other minor injuries,
some walking wounded, that were going to get treatment on their own,”
Douglas said.</p>
<p>Allcox said early weather warnings and tornado sirens likely saved
lives.</p>

tech firms warn Vietnam’s planned law to hamper data centers, social
media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. tech companies have warned Vietnam’s government
that a draft law to tighten rules on data protection and limit data
transfers abroad would hamper social media platforms and data center
operators from growing their businesses in the country.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian nation with a population of 100 million is one of
the world’s largest markets for Facebook and other online platforms, and
is aiming to exponentially increase its data center industry with
foreign investment in coming years.</p>
<p>The draft law “will make it challenging for tech companies, social
media platforms and data center operators to reach the customers that
rely on them daily,” said Jason Oxman, who chairs the Information
Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing big
tech companies including Meta, Google and data centers operator
Equinix.</p>
<p>The draft law, being discussed in parliament, is also designed to
ease authorities’ access to information and was urged by the ministry of
public security, Vietnamese and foreign officials said.</p>
<p>The ministry of public security and the information ministry did not
respond to attempts to contact them via email and phone.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s parliament is discussing the law in its current month-long
session and is scheduled to pass it on Nov. 30 “if eligible,” according
to its program, which is subject to changes.</p>
<p>Existing Vietnamese regulations already limit cross-border transfers
of data under some circumstances, but they are rarely enforced.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the new law, if adopted, would impact foreign
investment in the country. Reuters reported in August that Google was
considering setting up a large data center in southern Vietnam before
the draft law was presented in parliament.</p>
<p>Research firm BMI had said Vietnam could become a major regional
player in the data center industry as limits on foreign ownership are
set to end next year.</p>
<p>Among the provisions of the draft law is prior authorization for the
transfer overseas of “core data” and “important data,” which are
currently vaguely defined.</p>
<p>“That will hinder foreign business operations,” Oxman told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Tech companies and other firms favor cross-border data flows to cut
costs and improve services, but multiple jurisdictions, including the
European Union and China, have limited those transfers, saying that
allows them to better protect privacy and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, companies will have to share data with Vietnam’s
ruling Communist Party and state organizations in multiple, vaguely
defined cases including for “fulfilling a specific task in the public
interest.”</p>
<p>The U.S. tech industry has raised concerns with Vietnamese
authorities over “the undue expansion of government access to data,”
Oxman said.</p>
<p>The new law “would cause significant compliance challenges for most
private sector companies,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, noting talks were underway to
persuade authorities to “reconsider the rushed legislative process” for
the law.</p>

id="puerto-rico-prepares-for-election-day-as-a-third-party-candidate-makes-history">Puerto
Rico prepares for Election Day as a third-party candidate makes
history</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The two parties that have dominated Puerto
Rican politics for decades are losing their grip as they face the
stiffest competition yet from a younger generation fed up with the
island’s corruption, chronic power outages and mismanagement of public
funds.</p>
<p>For the first time in the island’s governor’s race, a third-party
candidate has a powerful second lead in the polls ahead of the U.S.
territory’s election Tuesday — and some experts say there’s a
possibility he could win.</p>
<p>“This election is already historic,” said political analyst and
university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto. “It already marks a before and
an after.”</p>
<p>Juan Dalmau is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and the
Citizen Victory Movement, established in 2019. A Gaither international
poll this month shows Dalmau closing in on Jenniffer González, a member
of the New Progressive Party and Puerto Rico’s representative in
Congress. She beat Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in their party’s primary in
June.</p>
<p>Gaither’s poll shows Dalmau with 29% of support versus González’s 31%
as he nearly caught up with her since a different poll in July showed
him with only 24% compared with González’s 43%. Coming in third was
Jesús Manuel Ortiz, of the Popular Democratic Party, followed by Javier
Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019.</p>
<p>Under pressure</p>
<p>Puerto Rican politics revolve around the island’s status, and up
until 2016, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood, and the
Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, would split at
least 90% of all votes during general elections, Schmidt said.</p>
<p>But that year, U.S. Congress created a federal control board to
oversee Puerto Rico’s finances after the government announced it was
unable to pay a more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, Puerto
Rico filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.</p>
<p>The debt was accrued through decades of corruption, mismanagement and
excessive borrowing, with Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority still
struggling to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, the largest of
any government agency.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans have largely rejected and resented the board, created a
year before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful
Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.</p>
<p>In 2020, Pierluisi won but received only 33% of votes. His opponent
from the Popular Democratic Party received 32%. It marked the first time
either party failed to reach 40% of votes.</p>
<p>The power outages that have persisted since the elections, coupled
with the slow pace of hurricane reconstruction, have frustrated and
angered voters.</p>
<p>Under Pierluisi, the government signed contracts with two companies,
Luma Energy and Genera PR, which together oversee the generation,
transmission and distribution of power. Outages have persisted, with the
companies blaming a grid that was already crumbling before the hurricane
hit due to a lack of maintenance and investment.</p>
<p>“Disastrous things have occurred during this four-year term,
especially with the electric energy,” Schmidt said. “It has affected
everyone, regardless of social class.”</p>
<p>Voters, he said, are viewing Tuesday’s elections “as a moment of
revenge.”</p>
<p>Dalmau said he would oust both companies in an “organized fashion”
within six months if he becomes governor. Ortiz said he would cancel
Luma’s contract, while González has called for the creation of an
“energy czar” that would review potential Luma contractual breaches
while another operator is found.</p>
<p>However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval of the
federal control board and Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau.</p>
<p>The candidates also are under pressure to create affordable housing,
lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crimes,
boost Puerto Rico’s economy, with the island locked out of capital
markets since 2015, and improve a crumbling health care system as
thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>Dalmau, who suspended his campaign for two weeks in mid-October after
his wife had emergency brain surgery, also has said he would eliminate
tax breaks for wealthy U.S. citizens from the mainland.</p>
<p>Apathy dominates</p>
<p>Despite their promises to turn Puerto Rico around, candidates face
persistent voter apathy.</p>
<p>In 2008, 1.9 million out of 2.5 million registered voters
participated in that year’s election, compared with 1.3 million out of
2.3 million in 2020.</p>
<p>This year, nearly 99,000 new voters registered and more than 87,000
reactivated their status, according to Puerto Rico’s State Elections
Commission.</p>
<p>“A much higher number was expected,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>He noted that those middle age and older favor González and her
pro-statehood party, while those younger than 45 “overwhelmingly” favor
Dalmau, which means that if a majority of young voters participate on
Tuesday and fewer older ones do so, he might have a chance of
winning.</p>
<p>The Bad Bunny factor</p>
<p>The months leading up to the Nov. 5 elections have been
contentious.</p>
<p>Reggaetón superstar Bad Bunny paid for dozens of billboard ads
criticizing Puerto Rico’s two main parties. In response, the governor’s
New Progressive Party financed a billboard ad suggesting an obscenity in
reference to Bad Bunny.</p>
<p>On Friday, the singer published a page-long letter in a local
newspaper deriding González’s pro-statehood party.</p>
<p>While the artist has not endorsed any local officials, the sole
person he recently began following on Instagram was Dalmau.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he briefly appeared at Dalmau’s closing campaign. A hush
fell over a crowd of tens of thousands of people as Bad Bunny spoke
before singing, saying he doesn’t endorse a specific candidate or
party.</p>
<p>“My party is the people. … My party is Puerto Rico,” he said as he
later praised the alliance between Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and
the Citizen Victory Movement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a so-called “cemetery of corruption” was set up Thursday
in the capital, San Juan, featuring large black-and-white pictures of
nearly a dozen politicians from the island’s two main parties who have
been charged or sentenced by federal authorities in recent years. It was
created by Eva Prados with the Citizen Victory Movement, who is running
for Puerto Rico’s House. By Friday, police reported that the pictures
were destroyed or stolen.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, the number of formal complaints about alleged
electoral crimes also has increased. These include people who say they
received confirmations for early voting when they made no such
request.</p>
<p>A persistent question</p>
<p>Voters on Tuesday also will be asked for a seventh time what Puerto
Rico’s political status should be.</p>
<p>The nonbinding referendum will feature three choices: statehood,
independence and independence with free association, under which issues
like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would
be negotiated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from
the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>The push for a change in status doesn’t depend on whether Kamala
Harris or Donald Trump win in the U.S. mainland.</p>

id="federal-judge-lets-iowa-challenge-voter-rolls-may-affect-naturalized-citizens">Federal
judge lets Iowa challenge voter rolls; may affect naturalized
citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can
continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential
noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting
rights of people who’ve recently become U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe
Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the
League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized
citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable
registrations to be challenged by local elections officials.</p>
<p>The state’s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued
that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent
illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made
possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking
point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President
Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are
committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.</p>
<p>In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision
four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its
voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S.
citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court’s recent refusal to review a
Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding
provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts
to “act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive
relief,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Locher also said the state’s effort does not remove anyone from the
voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional
ballots.</p>
<p>In a statement Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican,
celebrated the ruling.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling is a victory for election integrity,” Reynolds said.
“In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the
law and ensure those votes aren’t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a
non-citizen.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the ACLU said the organization did not immediately
have a comment.</p>
<p>After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU’s lawsuit Friday, Secretary of
State Paul Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a
statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote,
but the Biden administration wouldn’t provide data about them.</p>
<p>Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely
upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of
Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after
identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when
they previously sought driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>“Today’s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes
will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,” Bird said in the
statement issued after Sunday’s decision.</p>
<p>But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of
the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn’t have been
included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens’ voting
rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating
them if they cast ballots.</p>
<p>Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5
election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a
move so close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear that the secretary of state understands that this
list consists primarily or entirely of U.S. citizens who have exactly
the same fundamental core right to vote as the rest of us citizen Iowa
voters,” Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the ACLU of Iowa,
said during a Zoom briefing for reporters after the hearing.</p>
<p>The people on the state’s list of potential noncitizens may have
become naturalized </p>
<p>citizens after their statements to the Department of
Transportation.</p>
<p>Pate’s office told county elections officials to challenge their
ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave
the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon
further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their
U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his
original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate’s attorney
said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local
election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or
force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have
proven citizenship at a polling place.</p>
<p>Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to
vote, and the first question on Iowa’s voter registration form asks
whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential
voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that
if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five
years in prison.</p>
<p>Locher’s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar
program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S.
Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case
showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made
inactive were actually legally registered citizens.</p>
<p>In Iowa’s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a
tiny fraction of the state’s 2.2 million registered voters.</p>
<p>But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion
of the names on Pate’s list are registered voters who are not U.S.
citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would
force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he
added.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal
fight over this year’s election for months. Republicans have filed
dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after
being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints
about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats
have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.</p>

Nageeye of Netherlands and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya win New York City
Marathon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands won the men’s race at the
New York City Marathon on Sunday and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya took the
women’s event.</p>
<p>Both runners pulled away from their closest competitors in the final
few hundred meters to come away with their first victories in the
race.</p>
<p>Nageeye was step-for-step with 2022 champion Evans Chebet before
using a burst heading into Central Park to come away with the win in 2
hours, 7 minutes, 39 seconds. Chebet finished 6 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Chepkirui was running New York for the first time and pulled away
from defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women’s race. Chepkirui
started to run marathons in 2022. She finished the race in 2:24.35.
Obiri finished nearly 15 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Obiri was looking to be the first repeat champion since Mary Keitany
of Kenya won three in a row from 2014-16. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya
finished third, giving the African nation the top three spots.</p>
<p>Tamirat Tola, the men’s defending champion and Paris Olympic gold
medalist, finished fourth, right behind Albert Korir.</p>
<p>The top Americans finished sixth in both races. Conner Mantz led the
men and Sara Vaughn the women. Vaughn was in the lead group heading into
Mile 20 when they entered the Bronx before she dropped off the lead
pack.</p>
<p>Vaughn was geared up to run Chicago before COVID-19 kept her from
competing in that race. She was a late addition to this marathon.</p>
<p>The day got started with an upset in the men’s wheelchair race as
three-time defending champion Marcel Hug was beaten by Daniel Romanchuk,
who won in 2018 and 2019. Susannah Scaroni won the women’s wheelchair
race. It was her second victory in New York, also taking the 2022 race
and giving Americans winners in both events — the first time that has
happened.</p>
<p>The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New
York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This is the
48th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route
was completely in Central Park when it began in 1970. The first race had
only 55 finishers while more than 50,000 are expected to compete this
year.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect to run in with temperatures in the lower 40s
when the race started. Last year, it was 61 degrees when the race
started.</p>

id="will-people-leave-florida-after-devastating-hurricanes-history-suggests-not">Will
people leave Florida after devastating hurricanes? History suggests
not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>orlando, florida — The news rippled through Treasure Island, Florida,
almost like a third storm: The mayor planned to move off the barrier
island a month after Hurricane Helene flooded tens of thousands of homes
along the Gulf Coast and two weeks after Hurricane Milton also ravaged
the state. </p>
<p>Mayor Tyler Payne’s home had been flooded and damaged beyond repair,
he explained in a message to Treasure Island residents, and he and his
husband can’t afford to rebuild. He also was stepping down as
mayor. </p>
<p>“While it pains my heart to make this decision in the midst of our
recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, this is the best decision
for me and my family,” Payne, who had held the office for more than
three years and was a fourth-generation Treasure Island resident, said
Monday. </p>
<p>Up and down Florida’s storm-battered Gulf Coast, residents are making
the same calculations about whether they should stay or go. Can they
afford to rebuild? What will insurance cover? People considering moving
to Florida are contemplating whether it’s worth the risk to come to a
hurricane-prone state. </p>
<p>These existential questions about Florida’s appeal are raised
regularly after the state experiences a busy hurricane season, such as
in 2004, when four hurricanes crossed the Sunshine State. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If moves into the state offer any answer, then hurricanes have served
little as deterrents. Florida’s population has grown by one-third to 23
million residents in the two decades since Charley, Frances, Jeanne and
Ivan ravaged the state. Last year, Florida added more than 365,000
residents, second only to Texas among states. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are signs that Florida’s white-hot real
estate market has cooled. Sales of single-family homes were down 12% in
September compared with the same time in the previous year. But interest
rates, rising home prices and skyrocketing insurance costs likely played
bigger roles than the recent hurricanes. </p>
<p>“Florida recovers much faster than you think,” said Brad O’Connor,
chief economist for Florida Realtors. </p>
<p>What happens after a storm? </p>
<p>Studies of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast have shown that any
outbound migration tends to be short-lived, and if people do leave, it’s
usually a short-distance move, such as from a barrier island to the
mainland. Older people with more financial resources are more likely to
return to devastated communities. </p>
<p>When it comes to the housing market, there may be an initial shock to
the supply as homeowners wait for reimbursement from insurance companies
to fix up their homes or sell them. </p>
<p>But in the three years after a hurricane, home prices in areas of
Florida that were hit by one are 5% higher on average than elsewhere in
the state because of smaller supply, according to a study of the impact
of hurricanes on Florida’s housing market from 2000 to 2016. New
homeowners tend to be richer than previous ones because wealthier buyers
can absorb price increases. </p>
<p>Other factors that determine how quickly communities bounce back
include whether homes were insured, the speed of insurance
reimbursements, and whether there are enough construction workers.
Because of stricter building codes implemented in the years after
Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992, newer homes withstand
hurricanes better than older ones, O’Connor said. </p>
<p>“If a property is damaged and uninsured, and the homeowner says, ‘I
don’t want to deal with this,’ there are always people willing to scoop
up that property because it’s valuable land,” he said. “People build new
homes under the new codes and there’s less of an impact from
hurricanes.” </p>
<p>Short term and long term </p>
<p>Recent storms offer examples what happens to communities, both short
term and longer term. </p>
<p>In Lee County, home to Fort Myers, Hurricane Ian made landfall two
years ago in what had been one of the fastest growing parts of the
United States. Population growth slowed afterward to 1.5% from 4.4%
before the storm. The number of households dropped from about 340,000 to
about 326,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
<p>In 2019, three-quarters of all United Van Lines truck moves were into
Lee County and a quarter were outbound, but that dropped to two-thirds
inbound and a third outbound in 2023 to 2024, the company told The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>The share of people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s increased,
as did the share of men with no spouse or partner, reflecting an influx
of construction and recovery workers. The share of the white population
dropped while it increased for the Hispanic community. The percentage of
utility and transportation workers in the county jumped, according to
the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael made landfall as
the first Category 5 hurricane on the continental U.S. in a quarter
century in 2018, offers a portrait of longer term trends. Four years
later, Bay County had recovered its pre-hurricane population, which
dropped almost 6% in the year after the storm. </p>
<p>Since Michael, the county has grown more diverse, wealthier and
older, with the median age rising from 39.6 to 41.4 and more people
identifying as multiracial or Hispanic. The share of households earning
$200,000 or more went from 4.3% before the hurricane to 8.3% in 2022 in
a sign that some of the least affluent residents couldn’t afford to
rebuild or return. </p>
<p>Treasure Island’s mayor </p>
<p>In his message to constituents, Payne said he would still stay
connected to the Treasure Island community because his parents plan to
rebuild on the barrier island, one of a string of beach towns along the
Gulf of Mexico west of St. Petersburg known for motels, restaurants and
bars lining the street. Payne, an attorney who also is an executive in
his family’s eyeglass-lens manufacturing business, said in his message
that his decision to move was “difficult.” </p>
<p>“I completely empathize with the difficult decisions that are facing
so many of our residents,” he said.</p>

id="opponents-use-parental-rights-anti-trans-messages-to-fight-abortion-ballot-measures">Opponents
use parental rights, anti-trans messages to fight abortion ballot
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Billboards with the words “STOP Child Gender Surgery.”
Pamphlets warning about endangering minors. “PROTECT PARENT RIGHTS”
plastered on church bulletins.</p>
<p>As voters in nine states determine whether to enshrine abortion
rights in their state constitutions, opponents are using parental rights
and anti-transgender messages to try to undermine support for the ballot
proposals.</p>
<p>The measures do not mention gender-affirming surgeries, and legal
experts say changing existing parental notification and consent laws
regarding abortions and gender-affirming care for minors would require
court action. But anti-abortion groups hoping to end a losing streak at
the ballot box have turned to the type of language many Republican
candidates nationwide are using in their own campaigns as they seek to
rally conservative Christian voters.</p>
<p>“It’s really outlandish to suggest that this amendment relates to
things like gender reassignment surgery for minors,” said Matt Harris,
an associate professor of political science at Park University in
Parkville, Missouri, a state where abortion rights are on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections
for abortion, voters in seven states, including conservative Kentucky,
Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated
attempts to curtail them.</p>
<p>“If you can’t win by telling the truth, you need a better argument,
even if that means capitalizing on the demonization of trans children,”
said Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine physician in Omaha, Nebraska,
where anti-abortion groups are using the strategy.</p>
<p>Tying abortion-rights ballot initiatives to parental rights and
gender-affirming is a strategy borrowed from playbooks used in Michigan
and Ohio, where voters nonetheless enshrined abortion rights in the
state constitutions.</p>
<p>Both states still require minors to get parental consent for
abortions, and the new amendments have not yet impacted parental
involvement or gender-affirming care laws in either state, said David
Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University.</p>
<p>“It’s just recycling the same strategies,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, states where voters are
considering constitutional amendments this fall are Montana, Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota.</p>
<p>Missouri’s abortion ballot measure has especially become a target.
The amendment would bar the government from infringing on a “person’s
fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, both Republicans, have
claimed the proposal would allow minors to get abortions and
gender-affirming surgeries without parental involvement.</p>
<p>The amendment protects reproductive health services, “including but
not limited to” a list of items such as prenatal care, childbirth, birth
control and abortion. It does not mention gender-affirming care, but
Missouri state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican and lawyer with
the conservative Thomas More Society, said it’s possible that could be
considered reproductive health services.</p>
<p>Several legal experts told The Associated Press that would require a
court ruling that is improbable.</p>
<p>“It would be a real stretch for any court to say that anything
connected with gender-affirming care counts as reproductive health
care,” said Saint Louis University law and gender studies professor
Marcia McCormick. She noted that examples listed as reproductive health
care in the Missouri amendment are all directly related to
pregnancy.</p>
<p>As for parental consent for minors’ abortions, she pointed to an
existing state law that is written similarly to one the U.S. Supreme
Court found constitutional, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p>
<p>Most states have parental involvement laws, whether requiring
parental consent or notification. Even many Democratic-leaning states
with explicit protections for transgender rights require parental
involvement before an abortion or gender-affirming care for minors, said
Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California,
Davis School of Law.</p>
<p>A state high court would have to overturn such laws, which is highly
unlikely from conservative majorities in many of the states with
abortion on the ballot, experts said.</p>
<p>In New York, a proposed amendment to the state constitution would
expand antidiscrimination protections to include ethnicity, national
origin, age, disability and “sex, including sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and
reproductive health care and autonomy.” The constitution already bans
discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion.</p>
<p>The measure does not mention abortion. But because it is broader, it
could be easier for opponents to attack it. But legal experts noted that
it would also not change existing state laws related to parental
involvement in minors getting abortions or gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>The New York City Bar Association released a fact sheet explaining
that the measure would not impact parental rights, “which are governed
by other developed areas of state and federal law.” Yet the Coalition to
Protect Kids-NY calls it the “Parent Replacement Act.”</p>
<p>Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, the group behind
South Dakota’s proposed amendment said it uses the Roe v. Wade framework
“almost word for word.”</p>
<p>“All you have to do is look back at what was allowed under Roe, and
there were always requirements for parental involvement,” Weiland
said.</p>
<p>Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Life Defense
Fund, said the measure “means loving parents will be completely cut out
of the equation.” Weiland said those claims are part of a “constant
stream of misinformation” from opponents.</p>
<p>If this campaign strategy failed in Michigan and Ohio, why are
anti-abortion groups leaning on it for the November elections?</p>
<p>Ziegler, the University of California, Davis, law professor, said
abortion-rights opponents know they may be “playing on more favorable
terrain” in more conservative states like Missouri or in states like
Florida that have higher thresholds for passing ballot measures.</p>
<p>“Anti-abortion groups are still looking for a winning recipe,”
Ziegler said.</p>

<h2 id="americas-holiday-calendar-is-increasingly-diverse">America’s
holiday calendar is increasingly diverse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — John Albert’s daughter didn’t go to school on Friday. And
he couldn’t be happier about it.</p>
<p>For the first time, the high school senior and all of New York City’s
public school students have the day off to mark the holiday of Diwali,
celebrated in India and among the global Indian diaspora as the victory
of light over darkness and marked by communities of Hindus, Buddhists,
Jains and Sikhs.</p>
<p>To get the holiday added to the school calendar, where it joins other
days off for Rosh Hashanah, Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr as well as
federal holidays like Veterans Day, Christmas and Memorial Day, took
years of pushing from those in New York’s South Asian and Indo-Caribbean
communities like Albert. But it was worth it.</p>
<p>“It was this feeling of wanting to weave our culture into New York,”
he said.</p>
<p>From religious and cultural holidays to region-specific
commemorations to days meant to honor the towering figures and moments
of U.S. history, the holiday calendars across the 50 states and the
country at large are increasingly diverse ones, a reflection of and a
window into the many communities that make up the American whole.</p>
<p>Recognizing holidays creates community</p>
<p>Including a smaller culture’s or community’s special days as
something to recognize in the larger general culture is an act of unity,
said Lauren Strauss, professor of modern Jewish history at American
University.</p>
<p>“By doing that in an American context and by including a Muslim feast
for the end of Ramadan and by including Diwali and including Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my goodness. You’re just saying it out loud,
aren’t you? You’re saying that these cultures, these people, they aren’t
visitors, that they are a permanent part of this community, that it is
multicultural and multiethnic,” she said.</p>
<p>“Whether or not you think it’s good or bad, certainly it paints a
different picture of what it means to be American and what the American
calendar is.”</p>
<p>A look at what days are marked as holidays in places around the
country can be a crash course into what matters in those places.
Louisiana, home to New Orleans, takes a day for Mardi Gras. In Hawaii,
the state marks a day for King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian
islands, as well as a day for becoming a U.S. state. California and some
other states mark Cesar Chavez Day, named for the civil rights and labor
movement activist. In Texas and in the southwest, there are celebrations
scheduled for Friday marking Day of the Dead, the Mexican cultural
remembrance of loved ones who have passed.</p>
<p>The federal government, in addition to the 11 days that are days off
for federal workers, has a host of days that it marks as national
observances, like Harriet Tubman Day in March and Patriot Day on
September 11.</p>
<p>It keeps greeting card companies on their toes.</p>
<p>“Celebrating holidays and occasions, big or small, with the people we
care about is a vital thread that runs through our shared human
experience,” Kelly Ricker, chief product officer at American Greetings,
said in a statement. The company is “studying and talking to consumers,
continuously” to keep up with the kinds of cards people are looking
for.</p>
<p>When Chris Sargiotto started his greeting card company Apartment 2
Cards about 15 years ago, the holiday offerings were limited to
Christmas and Hanukkah. In recent years, he’s added Kwanzaa and Ramadan,
and is looking to bring Diwali cards onto the roster for next year.</p>
<p>The additional holidays were added because of requests from his
customers, the stores around that country that stock Apartment 2 cards,
a reflection of increasing demand.</p>
<p>“It was stores asking for it because of their customers are asking
for it,” he said. “Whenever we introduce one of these specific cards, it
seems to take off. So I think there definitely is the need for
these.”</p>
<p>There can be challenges as well</p>
<p>But a holiday is not always uncontested. Take mid-October, when the
federal government recognizes Columbus Day. It was added to the federal
calendar in the 20th century after efforts from Italian Americans, who
pushed for it as a way to stake their community’s place in America.</p>
<p>In the decades after though, Indigenous communities pushed back,
citing the impact of colonization on their people and the continuing
challenges. That has led to the spread of Indigenous People’s Day marked
on the same day, which while not a federally recognized is recognized in
states around the country.</p>
<p>And sometimes there’s some learning that needs to happen as well. In
Montville, New Jersey, the police department this month put a post on
Facebook explaining to the community that with Diwali approaching, they
would be more likely to see swastikas, a variation of which are ancient
sacred symbols in some religions and not deployed in the way Hitler and
the Nazis did.</p>
<p>With both Jewish and Hindu communities in the town, it was done in an
attempt to forestall misunderstanding, said Chief Andrew Caggiano, and
has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response.</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity,” he said, “to raise awareness about other
cultures that are that are in our community and that are part of our
community at this point.”</p>

id="inspired-by-harris-black-sorority-and-fraternity-members-help-downballot-races">Inspired
by Harris, Black sorority and fraternity members help downballot
races</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes isn’t a member of the
historically Black sororities and fraternities known as the “Divine
Nine.”</p>
<p>But throughout her hotly contested reelection campaign this year,
Hayes, the first Black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, has
sometimes felt like she’s a fellow soror, the term used by Black Greek
organizations for sorority sisters. On their own, members have shown up
to call voters, organize fundraisers, knock on doors, cheer Hayes on at
campaign events and even offer pro bono legal help.</p>
<p>“I had people from Massachusetts come in to volunteer,” said Hayes, a
Democrat who is seeking a fourth term. “I’ve had people who had
previously been considering going to a battleground state like
Pennsylvania and are saying, ‘No, we’re going to stay right here and
help out in this race in Connecticut.’”</p>
<p>Downballot candidates like Hayes — particularly Black women — have
benefited from a surge in support this year from volunteers who happen
to be members of Black Greek organizations, many energized by Kamala
Harris’ presidential run. The vice president is a longtime member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at her alma matter,
Howard University, in 1908. Harris pledged AKA as a senior at Howard in
1986.</p>
<p>Collectively known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine
historically Black sororities and fraternities are nonpartisan and
barred from endorsing candidates because of their not-for-profit status.
The organizations focus on voter registration drives, civic engagement
and nonelectoral initiatives and are careful not to show favor to a
particular candidate. But many of the groups’ members, as individuals,
have been “extremely active” in federal and state races around the
country this year, said Jaime R. Harrison, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a part of the Kamala Harris effect,” Harrison said
during a recent visit to Connecticut.</p>
<p>There were women affiliated with all the D9 sororities on a recent
get-out-the-vote bus tour through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland to support Black women on the ballot.</p>
<p>Along with other volunteers, they knocked on hundreds of doors, made
thousands of calls and sent out hundreds of postcards, urging people to
vote. The trip was organized by the Higher Heights for America PAC, a
nearly 13-year-old organization that works to elect progressive Black
women.</p>
<p>Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. showed off their crimson
and cream colors while stumping in Maryland for Democratic U.S. Senate
candidate Angela Alsobrooks, a fellow Delta who is in a closely watched
race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.</p>
<p>Volunteers who are D9 sorority members also campaigned for Democratic
U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, an honorary member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha who is running for the U.S. Senate. If both candidates were
elected, it would mark the first time two Black women have served in the
Senate simultaneously.</p>
<p>Latosha Johnson, a social worker from Hartford, recently participated
in a get-out-the-vote phone banking session for Hayes along with other
Black women who, like her, are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She said
there’s a realization among many Black and brown voters that the stakes
in the election are particularly high. And if Harris wins, she’ll need
allies in Congress, Johnson said.</p>
<p>“If we don’t get her a Congress that’s going to be able to move
things,” Johnson said, “that becomes hard.”</p>
<p>Hayes is in a rematch against former Republican George Logan, a
former state senator who identifies as Afro-Latino but has not seen an
outpouring of support from D9 members, according to his campaign.</p>
<p>Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are courting Black
voters in the final days of the presidential race. Harris’ campaign has
expressed concern about a lack of voting enthusiasm among Black men.</p>
<p>While Trump’s favorability among Black Americans has risen somewhat
since he left office in 2021, two-thirds still identify as Democrats.
About 2 in 10 identify as independents. About 1 in 10 identify as
Republicans, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Voter registration and nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts by the
sororities and fraternities, coupled with the mobilization of individual
members, could potentially have an impact on some of these races, said
Darren Davis, a professor of political science at the University of
Notre Dame.</p>
<p>“In local elections, in statewide elections, where the Black vote is
more powerful and concentrated as opposed to in national elections, D9
organizations have this tremendous untapped ability to reach and to
mobilize disaffected voters,” Davis said.</p>
<p>The D9 fraternal groups were founded on U.S. college campuses in the
early 1900s when Black students faced racial prejudice and exclusion
that prevented them from joining existing white sororities and
fraternities. In a tradition that continues today, the organizations
focused on mutual upliftment, educational and personal achievement,
civic engagement and a lifelong commitment to community service.</p>
<p>Many of the fraternities and sororities served as training grounds
for future civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. member Brandon McGee is a former
Democratic state representative who now leads Connecticut’s Social
Equity Council on cannabis. As the father of two daughters, he is
excited about helping Harris and Hayes win.</p>
<p>“I want my babies to see me working for a female who looks like their
mother. And even beyond looking like their mother, a female,” he said.
“And I want my babies to know, ‘You can do the same thing.’”</p>

id="ballot-box-fires-underscore-concerns-that-conspiracy-theories-make-them-targets">Ballot
box fires underscore concerns that conspiracy theories make them
targets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>atlanta, georgia — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest
were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before
Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in the city
of Vancouver in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire
suppression system contained the blaze and limited the number of ballots
damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they
try to identify who is responsible.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened, how rules and security measures about drop
boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have
undermined confidence in their use.</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in
Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were
connected and that they also are related to an October 8 incident when
an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in
Vancouver.</p>
<p>Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was
planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in
Portland to help them get replacements ballots.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the
Fisher’s Landing Transit Center when the drop box’s fire suppression
system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said
the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their
ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a
new one.</p>
<p>The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and
changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from
remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Kimsey described the suspected arson as “a direct attack on
democracy.”</p>
<p>When and where can drop boxes be used?</p>
<p>Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado,
Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered
voters.</p>
<p>They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as
election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded
polling places or were worried about mail delays.</p>
<p>In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop
boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Six others don’t have a specific law but allow local
communities to use them.</p>
<p>Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they’re located
inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere,
they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video
surveillance or someone watching.</p>
<p>Sporadic problems have occurred over the years.</p>
<p>In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in
Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots
were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A
drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020.</p>
<p>How should they be secured?</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises
state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient,
high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and
community centers.</p>
<p>If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at
all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance
cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled
with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours,
where they can be monitored.</p>
<p>How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop
boxes?</p>
<p>Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years,
targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they
were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>A debunked film called “2,000 Mules” amplified the claims, exposing
millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was
depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night.</p>
<p>An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the
U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes
in 2020.</p>
<p>Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when
armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were
restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True
the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in
various states.</p>
<p>In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot,
Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering
claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process.</p>
<p>How have states responded since the 2020 election?</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around
mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the
use of ballot drop boxes.</p>
<p>Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research
by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting
access.</p>
<p>Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa,
which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan
Center for Justice.</p>
<p>In Georgia’s Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1
million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year’s
presidential election. That’s down from 38 four years ago under an
emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It’s the result of an election
overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald
Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.</p>
<p>Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as
an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by
the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not
have a state law and do not use drop boxes.</p>
<p>Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year’s
presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along
ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted
away the city’s lone drop box, an action that’s under investigation by
the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned
and is in use.</p>

id="liberty-university-sued-by-former-it-staffer-fired-after-disclosing-shes-a-transgender-woman">Liberty
University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she’s a
transgender woman</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out
on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by
a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical
Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender
woman.</p>
<p>The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of
Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on
Liberty’s Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender
identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty
Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal
district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil
Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make
employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this
case a doctrinal statement asserting that “denial of birth sex by
self-identification with a different gender” is sinful.</p>
<p>Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over
its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities
in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its
residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late
Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative
activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years
before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals.</p>
<p>The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to
“set up” the university, applying for the IT job four months after
beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in
February 2023 — to adhere to the school’s statement rejecting
transgender transition.</p>
<p>Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university
of the gender transition process and then request that the school
“depart from its doctrine and mission,” Liberty Counsel said in an
effort to get the lawsuit dismissed.</p>
<p>“All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an
example out of the university for standing its ground,” contended Mat
Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman.</p>
<p>Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights
attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up.</p>
<p>“It’s strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real
concern with employment discrimination,” they said. “Her intention was
to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all
of her obligations.”</p>
<p>The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the
university</p>
<p>Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended
a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the
university — which she had admired — would accept her even after
learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance
review after completing her probation.</p>
<p>“I was really hoping they would work with me … that I could be
myself,” she told The Associated Press. “I was hoping I could advocate
for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.”</p>
<p>In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition,
Zinski stressed that her Christian faith “has been a guiding force
throughout this process.”</p>
<p>“The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has
imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,” she wrote.
“However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can
navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties
involved.”</p>
<p>Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what
she described as intense anxiety.</p>
<p>After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was
promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to
be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational
for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting.</p>
<p>“Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors
regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be
incompatible with our Christian workplace,” the email said.</p>
<p>What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit?</p>
<p>Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a
similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small,
private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes
spiritual life on campus as “inclusive and open.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people at work have my back,” Zinski said.</p>
<p>She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg’s Trinity
Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first
assured that “God made me this way.”</p>
<p>The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the
ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel’s motion to dismiss the
lawsuit.</p>
<p>Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said
there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion
to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far
beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the
U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called
“ministerial exception” — which gives religious institutions protection
against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial
functions.</p>
<p>Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, “Liberty considers them
to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right
to make that call.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on
behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university’s
handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at
least under its current leadership.</p>
<p>“My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who
do not want me there at all,” she said. “I would not feel comfortable
enough to work there.”</p>

id="latino-evangelical-voters-torn-between-their-faith-and-harsh-rhetoric-around-immigration">Latino
evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around
immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100
followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated
come election season.</p>
<p>Laguna’s church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven
closely watched swing states that could possibly decide the next
president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical
Christian community in the U.S.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation,
voting is “not an intellectual issue.”</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of faith and spirituality,” he said. “We’re in a
complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion,
and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around
immigration and lack of reform. It’s a difficult choice.”</p>
<p>This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in
numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily
declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both
parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles —
neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community
leaders.</p>
<p>A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S
identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals,
they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals
identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44%
identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left.</p>
<p>While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority
of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP
Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in
2020, while four in 10 supported Biden.</p>
<p>A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of
Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about
two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics
said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a
Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says
conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling
politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on
social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and
criminal justice reform, he said.</p>
<p>While many are offended by Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles
added, Democrats still haven’t figured out how to have conversations
with the community about issues such as abortion.</p>
<p>“So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,”
he said. “That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a
lot of discontent.”</p>
<p>To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand
their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the
Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word “evangelico”
pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a
wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said.</p>
<p>“When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the
Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people
create a new sense of community and family,” Conde-Frazier said. “People
are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this
country.”</p>
<p>With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline
denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities,
second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant
culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church,
she said.</p>
<p>“Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance,
began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the
U.S., moving away from their ‘evangelico’ roots,” Conde-Frazier said.
Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at
odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration.</p>
<p>Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including
undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable
dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews
perceive it.</p>
<p>“Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not
mean members are receiving it,” he said. “They selectively take what
they want from the teaching.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the
First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word
“evangelico” represents the Gospel to him. He says the “evangelical”
label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political
party.</p>
<p>“Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Some see their
Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others
see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party
is Christian in essence.”</p>
<p>Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too.</p>
<p>“I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I’d like
to belong to,” he said. “The most important value we as Christians must
live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing
persecution.”</p>
<p>Garcia said he has his “opinions and inclinations” but doesn’t view
the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: “If one is the
anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God
in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more
about the values a political party represents rather than the face or
the voice of the party.</p>
<p>“Our community doesn’t care about the politics,” she said. “They care
about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities,
education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on
family values. When they see the ballot, they don’t see Trump or
(Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is
going to fare under a candidate.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president
of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically
integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white
evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more
organically, she said.</p>
<p>“Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire
to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,” Tapia said.
“There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues.
Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being
manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?”</p>
<p>Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more
than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants
are healthcare education, public safety and housing.</p>
<p>“Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities
for marginalized communities,” he said. “As pastors, we don’t tell
people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that
best align with the values of the church and needs of our
communities.”</p>
<p>John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who
join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services
tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own
congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous
language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views.</p>
<p>“They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a
pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice
message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,” he said.</p>
<p>Nevada is also a key swing state.</p>
<p>Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in
North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is
a top issue for his congregants.</p>
<p>“Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here
already, they want the economy to be stable,” he said. “They see
homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough
neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.”</p>
<p>Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off
financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote
Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are
also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he
said.</p>
<p>“The struggle is real.”</p>

id="indian-americans-show-shifting-political-loyalties-ahead-of-presidential-election">Indian
Americans show shifting political loyalties ahead of presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — At a recent Diwali gathering in Denver, software
architect Salil Gaonkar asked his Indian American friends to raise their
hands: Would they vote for Trump or Harris in the presidential race?</p>
<p>The response — from about 45 tech professionals and business owners
who had overwhelmingly backed Joe Biden in 2020 — stunned him. Former
President Donald Trump edged out Vice President Kamala Harris, albeit by
a narrow margin.</p>
<p>“I was shocked,” Gaonkar, a progressive Democrat who is supporting
Harris, said. “Most of them voted for Biden, but now there was a
significant shift and that surprised me really.”</p>
<p>One dinner poll does not a trend make, but Gaonkar’s experience
appears to reflect a broader national pattern. Indian Americans, long a
reliable Democratic voting bloc, are showing signs of shifting
allegiance.</p>
<p>A Carnegie Endowment survey released this week showed the number of
Indian Americans identifying as Democrats dropped to 47% from 56% in
2020. Harris, despite her Indian heritage, commanded just 60% support
from a community that gave Biden nearly 70% of its votes four years ago.
Trump, meanwhile, improved his support to 31% from 22%.</p>
<p>The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%. And while
other polls show stronger South Asian support for Harris, the shift in
loyalties is significant, said Milan Vaishnav, director of Carnegie
Endowment’s South Asia program and one of the co-authors of the
study.</p>
<p>“We are seeing some signs of a greater shift or movement or
acceptance of at least this Republican Party, led by Trump, and that to
us, was a big surprise,” Vaishnav said in an interview with VOA last
Friday.</p>
<p>The rightward drift isn’t unique to Indian Americans. In recent
years, Republicans have made surprising gains among Hispanic, Black,
Arab and Muslim voters – all once deemed reliable Democratic voting
blocs.</p>
<p>Polls show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump, and whether
these shifts will propel the former president back to the White House
remains uncertain. But the findings shatter a core assumption of
American politics: that minority and immigrant communities are safely
Democratic, Vaishnav said, during an online presentation Thursday.</p>
<p>“There has been this idea of demography is destiny and that the
Democratic Party, which has been the natural home to ethnic and racial
minorities and many if not most immigrant communities … will have a
perpetual electoral advantage as the size of these groups increases,” he
said. “Clearly, there are many signs that that’s not true. Our survey is
one of them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More than 5 million strong, Indian Americans defy easy
categorization. They’re predominantly Hindus, with smaller numbers of
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others among them. While many
first-generation Indians lean conservative, plenty don’t.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Tuesday’s election, their concerns mirror those of other
Americans: Inflation, abortion, jobs, and immigration. U.S.-India
relations barely register.</p>
<p>“They vote like Americans because they are,” said Sumitra
Badrinathan, a professor at the American University and one of three
co-authors of the report, during the presentation.</p>
<p>Demolishing long-held assumptions about the community, the Carnegie
survey revealed that Harris’ Indian heritage hasn’t helped her top
Biden’s 2020 numbers. More surprisingly, it showed that Indian American
men under 40 — not their first-generation, supposedly “traditional”
elders — are driving the rightward shift.</p>
<p>“The Democrats don’t have a problem with the uncles,” Vaishnav said.
“They have a problem with males under 40.”</p>
<p>According to Pew Research, about two-thirds of Indian Americans are
immigrants. Many are politically split by era.</p>
<p>“People who came in 1990 or later are clinging to Trump, but people
[in] my dad’s generation are solidly Democratic,” said Angana Shah, a
Michigan-based social justice lobbyist and lawyer.</p>
<p>The divide between first- and second-generation Indians surfaces in
other ways. For many recent arrivals, illegal immigration has emerged as
a top concern. Gaonkar said his formerly Biden-supporting friends cite
illegal border crossings as the main reason for switching to Trump.</p>
<p>“Indians hate the illegal immigration that skyrocketed under Biden,”
Gaonkar said. “We know what hoops we have had to go through to get into
the country legally and stay here and to see some others come in like
that is not right.”</p>
<p>The sentiment cuts deep among first-generation immigrants. Take
Dharmendra Jaiswal, a Maryland tech executive whose path to citizenship
stretched nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>He voted for Biden in 2020, his first presidential election, but now
backs Trump.</p>
<p>“People are pissed off,” he said. “Illegal immigrants are getting
[education and health care] from our taxpayer money.”</p>
<p>Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in
the U.S. But Jaiswal said, “illegal immigrant is illegal immigrant.”</p>
<p>Suhag Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said the
backlash against illegal immigration makes sense. Immigration backlogs
force many Indian immigrants to wait 10 to 20 years for green cards and
citizenship.</p>
<p>“People should not be in limbo for 20 years, but unfortunately that
is the state of the immigration program that we are dealing with today
and many are speaking out just like many other Americans about the need
to have stronger borders,” Shukla said in an interview with VOA this
week.</p>
<p>Criticized for being soft on unauthorized immigration, Harris has
defended her record, highlighting a drop in illegal border crossings due
to recent policy changes implemented by the Biden administration. For
his part, Trump has vowed to carry out the “largest deportation
operation in American history.”</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign, launched in July, electrified many progressive
Indian Americans, drawing thousands of eager volunteers.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm masked a deeper reality: Her Indian heritage
proved a weak draw for many voters. The Carnegie survey found that fewer
than 1 in 10 Indian American supporters were motivated by her South
Asian heritage.</p>
<p>Towson University professor Pallavi Guha, an Indian American, said
many members of her community are “looking beyond identity
politics.”</p>
<p>“People who are supporting Vice President Harris are supporting Vice
President Harris because of the policies,” Guha, who lives in Howard
County, Maryland, said in an interview with VOA on Thursday.</p>
<p>A survey of South Asian voters by the Indian American Impact Fund, a
political group, found Harris leading Trump, 68% to 20%, in the
battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>With more than 400,000 eligible South Asian voters in these states,
the community is “poised to make the margin of difference in what will
likely be a razor-thin election,” the group said in a statement last
month.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm isn’t uniform. Rupal Shah, an Atlanta-based
second-generation Indian American non-profit worker volunteering for
IAI, sees a generational divide.</p>
<p>“I’m second generation and I believe that my generation of folks are
very, very pro-Kamala, ready to vote for her, excited about her,” Shah
said. “And then when you talk to my parents or parents in general, you
get a sense of excitement and a sense of nervousness.”</p>
<p>“Their fiscal concerns always kind of rise to the top, but there’s
also a lot of excitement about Kamala and who she represents and how she
represents our community,” Shah said.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment
but did not receive a response from either group.</p>

lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its
survival, lawsuit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing
the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an
endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows
and threaten cultural resources.</p>
<p>The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week
ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.’s Rhyolite
Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm’s buckwheat is known to
exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and
Las Vegas.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President
Joe Biden’s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda
intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the
production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar
panels.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit says the Interior Department’s approval of the mine
marks a dramatic about-face by U.S. wildlife experts who warned nearly
two years ago that Tiehm’s buckwheat was “in danger of extinction now”
when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.</p>
<p>“One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously
destroying biodiversity,” said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western
Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed
Thursday in federal court in Reno.</p>
<p>“The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not
justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone
environmental laws,” said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin
Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.</p>
<p>Rita Henderson, spokesperson for Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining
company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and “vigorously
defend” approval of the project, “which was based on its careful and
thorough permitting process.”</p>
<p>“We are confident that the BLM will prevail,” Yeftich said. He added
that he doesn’t expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin
construction next year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western
Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than
1.6 kilometers away described as “a site of intergenerational
transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.”</p>
<p>But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act.
It details the Fish and Wildlife Service’s departure from the dire
picture it painted earlier of threats to the 15-centimeter-tall
wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine
Ioneer plans to dig. </p>
<p>The mine’s permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 3.6
square kilometers the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding
the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival —
would be lost for decades, some permanently.</p>
<p>When proposing protection of the 368 hectares of critical habitat,
the service said “this unit is essential to the conservation and
recovery of Tiehm’s buckwheat.” The agency formalized the designation
when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of
less-stringent threatened status.</p>
<p>“We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because
the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger
of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the
future,” the agency concluded.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant’s
population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government’s latest
estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not
considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s biological
opinion.</p>
<p>The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by
rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population
as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion
that while the project “will result in the long-term disturbance
(approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant
community … and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not
expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical
habitat as a whole.”</p>

separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with
loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different
countries. </p>
<p>Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to
reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to
the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with
their loved ones. </p>
<p>This year, the annual “Hugs Not Walls” event organized by an
immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S.
presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily
on immigration and border security. It also took place under decreased
security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of
Migrants. </p>
<p>“We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers
deployed in our community,” said Fernando Garcia, the organization’s
director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has
seen since the reunions began last decade. “The barbed wire had to be
opened so that the families could have this event.” </p>
<p>Garcia said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless
of who wins Tuesday’s election. Family reunions, he said, will continue,
too. </p>
<p>“Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating
families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these
families,” he said.</p>

<p>U.S. border authorities apprehended about 54,000 migrants illegally
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary
figures obtained by Reuters. They show a marginal rise from September
