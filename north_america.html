<li>What to expect from the looming LNG report

<p>
The Department of Energy’s study on liquefied natural gas exports could
drop as soon as today, but we might already know what’s in it thanks to
an accompanying letter written by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and

by <em>The New York Times</em>. The key takeaways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Continued U.S. LNG exports at recent levels would have negative impacts
on both the economy and the environment.
</li>
<li>
“Unfettered exports” would drive up wholesale domestic gas prices by
30%, hurting consumers and industry alike.
</li>
<li>
Increasing exports could generate 1.5 gigatons of direct

id="us-hits-north-korea-and-russia-with-new-sanctions-treasury-says">US
hits North Korea and Russia with new sanctions, Treasury says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States hit North Korea and Russia on Monday
with new sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s financial and military support
to Moscow as well as its ballistic missile program.</p>
<p>The sanctions, which list North Korean banks, generals and other
officials, as well as Russian oil shipping companies, are the latest
U.S. measure aimed at disrupting North Korea’s support to Russia’s war
in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The North Korean banks targeted include Golden Triangle Bank, one of
the biggest banks in the northeastern Rason Special Economic Zone, and
Pyongyang-based Korea Mandal Credit Bank, which has representatives
throughout China, the Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>South Korea’s foreign ministry separately said on Tuesday that it has
blacklisted 11 individuals and 15 entities linked to illicit military
cooperation between North Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>The responses came as 10 countries, including the U.S., South Korea,
Australia, Britain, France and Japan, as well as the European Union,
issued a joint statement on Tuesday condemning Pyongyang and Moscow’s
military ties “in the strongest possible terms.”</p>
<p>The statement said North Korea’s support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine was a “dangerous expansion of the conflict” and a “flagrant
violation” of United Nations’ sanctions. It urged the country to
withdraw its troops from Russia.</p>
<p>Pyongyang and Moscow have ramped up diplomatic and economic ties in
recent years, culminating in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to
North Korea in June when the countries’ leaders agreed a mutual defense
pact.</p>
<p>Military cooperation between the two countries has been met by
international alarm, with Washington, Kyiv and Seoul condemning North
Korea for sending military equipment and more than 10,000 troops to
support Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February
2022.</p>
<p>North Korea’s actions, including its most recent test of a long-range
ballistic missile and its deepening military support to Russia,
undermine the stability of the region and sustain Putin’s war in
Ukraine, said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury
for terrorism and financial intelligence.</p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to disrupting the illicit
procurement and facilitation networks that enable these destabilizing
activities,” he said.</p>
<p>The officials sanctioned by both Washington and Seoul include North
Korean generals leading tens of thousands of North Korean troops in
Russia, including Kim Yong Bok, who has appeared at seven events with
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, including special forces
exercises.</p>
<p>South Korea separately blacklisted the North’s special forces unit
known as the Storm Corps, also in Russia fighting against Ukraine, and
its chief, Ri Pong Chun.</p>
<p>Ukraine said on Monday that at least 30 North Korean soldiers had
been killed or injured in combat in Russia’s Kursk region over the
weekend.</p>
<p>It said that Moscow began deploying them in the southern region in
significant numbers last week to conduct assaults on Ukrainian
forces.</p>
<p>Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August.</p>
<p>Kyiv estimates there are 11,000 North Koreans in total, adding to a
force of tens of thousands of Russians.</p>
<p>Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Koreans
on its side.</p>
<p>Oil and gas to the North </p>
<p>The Treasury sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of the designated
entities, ban their trade with Americans, and block them from
transactions with the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>The Treasury blacklisted Russia-based foreign trade companies that it
said were shipping oil and gas to North Korea. The companies include
Vostok Trading, DV Ink, and Novosibirskoblgaz. Treasury said they began
shipping “thousands of tons of oil and gas” to North Korea beginning in
2022 and continuing through at least April 2024.</p>
<p>North Korea has likely received more than 1 million barrels of oil
from Russia over an eight-month period this year in breach of U.N.
sanctions, according to an analysis of satellite imagery published in
November by the British-based Open Source Centre and the BBC.</p>
<p>North Korean oil tankers have made more than 40 visits to Russia’s
Far Eastern port of Vostochny since March, the report on the research
group Open Source Centre’s website said.</p>
<p>The sanctions also targeted Sibregiongaz, AO, the Russia-based parent
company and 100% owner of Novosibirskoblgaz. They also hit Okryu Trading
Company, or Okryu, a North Korea-based foreign trade company that
Treasury said has received thousands of tons of oil shipments from
Russia.</p>

id="judge-rejects-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-hush-money-conviction-because-of-supreme-court-immunity-ruling">Judge
rejects Trump’s bid to dismiss hush money conviction because of Supreme
Court immunity ruling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A judge Monday rejected President-elect Donald Trump’s bid
to have his hush money conviction dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme
Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity. But the case’s overall
future remains unclear.</p>
<p>Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan’s decision eliminates one potential
off-ramp from the case ahead of Trump’s return to office next month. His
lawyers have raised other arguments for dismissal, however.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said there should be some accommodation for his
upcoming presidency, but they insist the conviction should stand.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>A jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business
records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy
Daniels in 2016. Trump denies wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The allegations involved a scheme to hide the payout to Daniels
during the final days of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to keep her
from publicizing — and keep voters from hearing — her claim of a sexual
encounter with the married then-businessman years earlier. He says
nothing sexual happened between them.</p>
<p>A month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents
can’t be prosecuted for official acts — things they did in the course of
running the country — and that prosecutors can’t cite those actions to
bolster a case centered on purely personal, unofficial conduct.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers then cited the Supreme Court opinion to argue that
the hush money jury got some improper evidence, such as Trump’s
presidential financial disclosure form, testimony from some White House
aides and social media posts made while he was in office.</p>
<p>In Monday’s ruling, Merchan denied the bulk of Trump’s claims that
some of prosecutors’ evidence related to official acts and implicated
immunity protections.</p>
<p>The judge said that even if he found that some evidence related to
official conduct, he’d still find that prosecutors’ decision to use
“these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying
business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and
function of the Executive Branch.”</p>
<p>Even if prosecutors had erroneously introduced evidence that could be
challenged under an immunity claim, Merchan continued, “such error was
harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors had said the evidence in question was only “a sliver” of
their case.</p>
<p>Trump communications director Steven Cheung on Monday called
Merchan’s decision a “direct violation of the Supreme Court’s decision
on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence.”</p>
<p>“This lawless case should have never been brought, and the
Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,” Cheung said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case,
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Trump takes office January 20.</p>

SoftBank CEO announce $100 billion investment in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a joint appearance Monday morning, President-elect Donald Trump
and Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of the Japanese technology
conglomerate SoftBank Group, announced that the company would invest
$100 billion in U.S. companies over the coming four years, saying that
the infusion of cash would create 100,000 jobs in fields such as
artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Son attributed the decision to make the investment directly to
Trump’s win in last month’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President
Trump,” Son said. “My confidence level [in] the economy of the United
States has tremendously increased with his victory. So, because of that,
I’m now excited to commit this 100 billion dollars and 100,000 jobs into
the United States.”</p>
<p>In introducing Son, Trump pointed out that eight years ago, after
Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, SoftBank had made a similar
pledge, promising $50 billion in U.S. investments and 50,000 new
jobs.</p>
<p>“And they did,” Trump said. “They kept that promise in every way,
shape and form.”</p>
<p>The president-elect then went on to press Son to double his pledge,
saying “I’m going to ask him right now. Would you make it $200
billion?”</p>
<p>Son reiterated his promise of $100 billion, but said he would “try”
to get to $200 billion.</p>
<p>“All right. $200 billion,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Son burst into laughter, telling the crowd Trump is “a great
negotiator.”</p>
<p>‘Trump effect’</p>
<p>After the announcement Monday, Trump’s rapid response director, Jake
Schneider, sent media outlets an email attributing the announcement to
what he called the “Trump Effect.”</p>
<p>“President Trump is already delivering on his commitment to re-make
America into the world’s manufacturing superpower once again — and he
hasn’t even taken office yet,” Schneider wrote. “It’s all centered
around his Made in America agenda, which incentivizes companies that
make their products in America with American workers.”</p>
<p>He added, “In January, President Trump will immediately begin
implementing bold reforms to restore the nation to full prosperity and
make sure AI, emerging technologies, and the other industries of
tomorrow are created, built, and grown in the United States.”</p>
<p>Hits and misses</p>
<p>Since founding SoftBank in 1981 at age 24, Son has become one of the
most storied — and controversial — technology investors in the world.
The company has several investment funds and owns significant shares of
hundreds of companies across multiple fields, including
telecommunication, robotics, internet services, e-commerce, artificial
intelligence and much more.</p>
<p>Throughout his decades-long career, Son has made headlines for
spectacular victories as well as disastrous failures. For a time, at the
beginning of 2000, he claimed to be the world’s richest man, with a
fortune worth an estimated $78 billion amassed by buying up internet
startups. However, the collapse of the dotcom bubble just months later
wiped out more than 90% of his wealth.</p>
<p>Son started rebuilding his business that same year, and a $20 million
investment that bought SoftBank a 34% ownership share in a little-known
Chinese e-commerce startup known as Alibaba would prove key to his
fortunes. In 2014, Alibaba went public at a price that valued SoftBank’s
shares at $58 billion, some 2,900 times its initial investment.</p>
<p>Along the way, Son successfully managed to merge mobile
telecommunications firms T-Mobile and Sprint, creating one of the
largest U.S. service providers in 2020. Just two years later, though,
SoftBank suffered disastrous losses with the collapse of the
office-sharing startup WeWork, in which it had invested heavily, as well
as other failed investments by in-house venture and hedge funds.</p>
<p>At the time, Son announced that he was retiring from public life.
However, by 2023, he was back in the headlines when ARM Holdings, a
British computer chip design firm that SoftBank bought at a valuation of
$30.8 billion in 2016, went public in the U.S. at a valuation of $54.5
billion.</p>
<p>Choosing the West over China</p>
<p>Lionel Barber, the former editor-in-chief of the Financial Times,
told VOA that he believes Son’s appearance at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort
Monday signals more than just an international investor seeking to get
on the good side of an incoming U.S. president.</p>
<p>Barber is the author of Gambling Man: The Wild Ride of Masayoshi Son,
the first biography of the investor by a Western author, which will be
published in the U.S. next month. He said that when Son made his pledge
of $50 billion in 2016, he and Trump had clearly aligned interests.</p>
<p>“Trump wanted a big signal about business confidence in the Trump
agenda and Masayoshi Son and SoftBank wanted to get in with the new
Republican administration with an eye to getting [a] blessing for his
big project, which was Sprint merging with T-Mobile,” Barber told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Now, though, he sees something larger at play.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the world looks very different. Eight years on, we’ve got
wars around the world, and we’ve also got de-risking and decoupling
between China and the West,” Barber said.</p>
<p>In his last interview with him, Barber told VOA, Son said that he had
realized that it was necessary for SoftBank to make a choice between
China and the West.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Son, Barber said, “He basically said, ‘We understand the
world’s changed. We’ve been a global investor. We’ve been the biggest
investor in China and the biggest investor in America. But now we have
to choose. We’ve chosen the West.’”</p>
<p>“So, I see his getting into Mar-a-Lago as [saying], ‘I’ve chosen the
West. I’ve chosen America, and I’m going with Trump.’”</p>
<p>Investment details unclear</p>
<p>The announcement at Mar-a-Lago did not include any details about
specific investments that SoftBank intends to make, and not all foreign
investments touted by Trump over the years have come to pass.</p>
<p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2017 promised a $10
billion investment in a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin that was
later dramatically scaled back.</p>
<p>Even SoftBank’s 2016 pledge is difficult to consider truly fulfilled
unless the more than $20 billion the company poured into Sprint in 2013
— three years before making the pledge — is included in the total.</p>
<p>Barber, Son’s biographer, said he has some doubts about SoftBank’s
ability to identify $100 billion in U.S. investments over the course of
four years.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I haven’t figured out how he
gets to 100 billion, yet,” Barber said.</p>
<p>However, he said, it’s also important not to underestimate Son’s
ability to achieve unexpected successes.</p>
<p>“You can’t write him off,” Barber said. “That’s what he does. He’s a
bloody genius in that respect.”</p>

id="tices-mother-asks-netanyahu-to-pause-syria-strikes-to-locate-journalist">Tice’s
mother asks Netanyahu to pause Syria strikes to locate journalist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who has
been detained in Syria for more than 12 years, reiterated her call
Monday for the Israeli military to pause strikes in a part of Syria
where her son may be held.  </p>
<p>“I think it would be polite, to say the least, that perhaps they’re
not bombing while people are trying to clear the prisons,” Debra Tice
told reporters Monday afternoon outside the Syrian Embassy in
Washington.  </p>
<p>That call comes days after she made the same appeal in a letter to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  </p>
<p>In a letter dated Dec. 14, Debra Tice told the Israeli leader her
family has “credible information” that her son may be held in a prison
outside the Syrian capital, Damascus, and urged the Israeli military to
pause strikes in the area to allow rescuers to search the site.  </p>
<p>“We are aware that your military has an active campaign in the area,
preventing rescuers from approaching and accessing the prison facility,”
she wrote in the letter, which The New York Times published Monday. </p>
<p>The Israeli military has been bombing weapons depots and air defenses
in Syria. Israel says it wants to keep military equipment away from
extremists.  </p>
<p>In the letter, Debra Tice said her son may be held in a prison under
a Syrian military museum in the mountainous Mount Qasioun area. The
prison was connected by a tunnel to a neighborhood and a government
palace, she added in the letter. </p>
<p>“We have no way of knowing if the prisoners there have food and
water. We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy
Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners. Time is of
the essence,” she said. </p>
<p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment. </p>
<p>But Gal Hirsch, the Israeli government’s lead envoy for hostage
affairs, told The Times that he had received the letter and was
coordinating with U.S. officials. </p>
<p>“We will do everything possible in assisting the United States of
America to bring the hostages and missing persons back home,” Hirsch
said. </p>
<p>A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Austin Tice has been held in
Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus.
Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or
seen of him since. </p>
<p>Earlier in December, before the Bashar al-Assad government fell, the
Tice family revealed it had obtained information vetted by the U.S.
government that confirmed Austin Tice was still alive and detained in
the Damascus area.  </p>
<p>Since Syrian rebels, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham (HTS), took Damascus and toppled Assad’s government on December
8, thousands of prisoners have been released from prisons run by the
now-deposed government.  </p>
<p>The release of those prisoners has raised hope in the Tice family
that Austin will be among them.  </p>
<p>“I feel like we’re standing in line, and we’re not the only ones that
are still standing in line,” Debra Tice told reporters Monday. “It’s
going to take a while.”  </p>
<p>Austin Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer
who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and
McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad. </p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters
Monday that the  </p>
<p>United States has communicated with HTS on the importance of locating
Austin Tice, but that there are no U.S. government personnel on the
ground in Syria looking for the journalist.  </p>
<p>“We have a number of people engaged on trying to find Austin Tice and
bring him home, and we communicated directly to HTS that anything that
they could do to help us find him, we would greatly appreciate,” Miller
said.  </p>
<p>Syria’s transitional government said last week that the search for
Austin Tice is ongoing, and that it would cooperate with the U.S.
government in finding Americans who were disappeared by the former Assad
government.  </p>
<p>Outside the Syrian Embassy in Washington, which the U.S. government
forced to close in 2014 but may now reopen soon, Debra Tice told
reporters she has never lost hope that her son will return home. </p>
<p>“I’ve always had hope. I’ve never had even a millisecond of
hopelessness,” she said. “We just need to get all those prisons opened,
get all those families reunited, including us.”</p>

id="man-sentenced-for-helping-pregnant-chinese-women-in-us-birthing-scheme">Man
sentenced for helping pregnant Chinese women in ‘US birthing
scheme’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — A California man was sentenced Monday to nearly 3½
years in prison for running an extensive business that helped pregnant
Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who would
automatically have American citizenship.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities had sought a more than five-year prison term for
Michael Wei Yueh Liu, 59, who was convicted in September of conspiracy
and money laundering for running a company known as USA Happy Baby.
Phoebe Dong, Liu’s wife — though the couple have since separated — was
also convicted in connection with the scheme and is expected to be
sentenced early next year.</p>
<p>After receiving a 41-month sentence, Liu was led out of the courtroom
by authorities and taken into custody. He gave his attorney his belt and
a folder and held Dong’s hand briefly while she sobbed.</p>
<p>In court, Liu had pleaded for leniency to care for his elderly
parents and 13-year-old son, all of whom depend on him, while about a
dozen supporters, many from his church, attended to provide moral
support. Liu said his family has suffered deeply for nearly a decade
since a 2015 raid on his business.</p>
<p>“My intent was always to uphold the values of integrity and
responsibility, so I regret any actions or decisions that may have
brought us to this moment of judgment,” Liu told the court during his
sentencing hearing. “I have tried my best to remain a source of
stability for my family, but my incarceration will place them in a more
vulnerable position.”</p>
<p>“I am not here to deflect responsibility, but to seek mercy,” he
said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner said defendants’ family members
are often the ones who suffer, but it is the defendant’s actions, not
the court’s, that caused the harm. Nevertheless, Klausner said he was
reducing the sentence due to Liu’s family situation.</p>
<p>“These are choices you make, not that the court makes,” Klausner
said.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities said USA Happy Baby helped several hundred women
travel from China to give birth to U.S.-citizen babies between 2012 and
2015. The tourists paid as much as $40,000 for services including
apartment rentals during their stays in Southern California and worked
with overseas entities that coached women on what to say during visa
interviews and upon arriving in U.S. airports, advising them to wear
loose clothing to hide their pregnancies.</p>
<p>“For tens of thousands of dollars each, [the] defendant helped his
numerous customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for
their children,” federal prosecutors wrote in court papers. “This
criminal conduct is serious and requires a meaningful sentence to
promote respect for the law and hold [the] defendant accountable.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to comment immediately after the sentencing.</p>
<p>Kevin Cole, Liu’s attorney, had asked that his client face no more
than 26 months and requested he be allowed to serve his sentence from
home. On Monday, Cole asked the judge to consider his client’s critical
role as the caretaker for his 95-year-old father and 82-year-old mother,
shuttling them to medical appointments, bathing them and cooking their
food, and his otherwise upstanding life growing up in Taiwan — serving
in its military and attending to his family.</p>
<p>“He’s somebody that has lived an honorable life,” Cole told the
court. “There’d be no benefit to him or the public for an extensive
prison sentence in this case.”</p>
<p>The case against Liu and Dong dates back years. Federal authorities
searched more than a dozen homes across Southern California in a 2015
crackdown on operators of businesses catering to Chinese women seeking
to deliver their babies in the United States and four years later
charged the pair and more than a dozen others, including a woman who
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for running a
company known as You Win USA.</p>
<p>Such businesses have long operated in California and other states and
have catered to people not only from China, but also from Russia,
Nigeria and elsewhere. It isn’t illegal to visit the United States while
pregnant but lying to U.S. consular and immigration officials about the
reasons for travel on government documents is not permitted.</p>
<p>The key draw for travelers has been that the United States has
birthright citizenship, which many believe could help their children
secure a U.S. college education and provide a sort of future insurance
policy — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for
permanent residency once their American child turns 21.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has promised to end birthright
citizenship once in office, but any such effort would face steep legal
hurdles.</p>

<p>What is going on in the skies of the eastern United States? In recent

to the incoming president has questions. Anita Powell reports from

<h2 id="us-census-bureau-adding-refugees-to-immigrant-count">US Census
Bureau adding refugees to immigrant count</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts immigrants in annual
estimates by including more people who were admitted for humanitarian,
and often temporary, reasons. </p>
<p>The change is being made in an effort to better reflect population
shifts this decade, officials said Monday. Population estimates,
including immigration, are due to be released Thursday showing how the
populations of the United States and the 50 states changed this year.
However, the new approach to counting immigrants will only be reflected
nationally. </p>
<p>The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign born rose to its
highest level in more than a century in 2023. It could be even higher
under the new methodology. Census Bureau officials wouldn’t say Monday
how much larger they expected the immigration figures to be in
Thursday’s release because of the change. </p>
<p>Capturing the number of new immigrants is the most difficult part of
the annual U.S. population estimates. Although the newly announced
change in methodology is unrelated, the timing comes a month before a
return to the White House of President-elect Donald Trump, who has
promised mass deportations of people in the United States
illegally. </p>
<p>“We feel confident that this was a good approach in order to make our
estimates more current and reflect recent trends that we’ve seen,” said
Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>The bureau’s annual calculation of how many migrants entered the
United States in the 2020s has been much lower than the numbers cited by
other federal agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The
Census Bureau estimated 1.1 million immigrants entered the United States
in 2023, while the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate was 3.3
million people. </p>
<p>The group of people being included in the international migration
estimates are those who enter the country through humanitarian parole,
which has been granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic
presidential administrations to people unable to use standard
immigration routes because of time pressure or their government’s poor
relations with the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, said last week that more than
5.8 million people were admitted under various humanitarian policies
from 2021 to 2024. </p>
<p>Trump appears certain to dismantle humanitarian parole, saying during
his campaign that he would end the “outrageous abuse of parole.” The
annual population estimates released by the Census Bureau each year are
calculated from births, deaths, migration to the United States and
migration between states. The population estimates provide the official
population counts each year between the once-a-decade census for the
United States, the 50 states, counties and metro areas. The figures are
used for distributing trillions of dollars in federal funding.</p>

<h2 id="trump-discusses-drone-sightings-along-us-east-coast">Trump
discusses drone sightings along US East Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump contended Monday that the country’s
military “for some reason” was keeping details secret about unexplained
drones flying across the nighttime skies above the eastern United
States, but the White House later minimized the drone sightings.</p>
<p>“Our military knows … something strange is going on,” Trump told
reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in his first wide-ranging
news conference since his election to a new four-year term in the White
House starting next month.</p>
<p>For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders
New York City, and other states to the north and south along the
Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed
drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated.</p>
<p>They say that most of the alleged unmanned drones are manned
aircraft, and that fewer than 100 of the sightings need to be
investigated further.</p>
<p>All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the
unexplained sightings, including the dispatching of drones by foreign
countries and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership
positioned off U.S. eastern coastal waters.</p>
<p>At the White House, National Security spokesperson John Kirby told
reporters, “Our assessment at this stage is that the activity represents
commercial, hobbyist, law enforcement drones, all operating legally and
lawfully, and/or civilian aviation aircraft.”</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing before Trump’s news conference began, Air
Force Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters
there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings
pose a national security or public safety threat, or have a foreign
nexus.”</p>
<p>Ryder added, “We are sensitive to the fact that there are public
concerns and many questions. … We are also committed to providing as
much information as possible as quickly as possible on this.”</p>
<p>The military has a rationale for not shooting them down, Ryder said,
offering a “loose analogy” to unexplained cars traveling near military
bases.</p>
<p>“On any given day, an unauthorized car or truck may approach one of
the base gates, usually on accident,” Ryder said, and “99% of the time
those cars are turned away without incident.”</p>
<p>“The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,” Ryder said.
“There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis.
It’s not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication
of malicious activity or any public safety threat.”</p>
<p>In recent days, Republican and Democratic officials alike have called
on officials in the administration of President Joe Biden to be more
forthcoming in saying what they know about the drones.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, who is set to
become Trump’s national security adviser when he takes office January
20, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We need to get to the bottom
of it.”</p>
<p>In his hourlong news conference, Trump touched on a wide range of
topics five weeks before assuming power again and becoming the second
president after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s to take over the White
House for a second nonconsecutive term.</p>
<p>He said his reception from world leaders this time is sharply more
favorable than it was in 2017 after his first presidential victory.</p>
<p>“It’s really the opposite of hostile. They’re calling me,” he said.
“I’ve spoken to over 100 countries.”</p>
<p>Trump said he would not end the use of the long-accepted polio
vaccine in the U.S. but questioned the mandates in many U.S. states for
a range of childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>“I’m not really a big mandate guy,” he said, and asked rhetorically,
“Why is the autism rate so high” in the United States, although any link
between autism and vaccines has long been scientifically debunked.</p>
<p>He also questioned why Americans “are paying so much more than people
in other countries” for medicines.</p>
<p>Trump said that he was doing his best to stop Russia’s nearly
three-year war on Ukraine, and that he would have ongoing conversations
with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy about a halt to the fighting.</p>
<p>He called much of Ukraine “a demolition site” because of Russian
attacks. “People can’t go back there.”</p>
<p>Trump called the U.S. media “very corrupt” after winning a $15
million defamation settlement against ABC News over the weekend. He said
he is planning lawsuits against other news outlets and individual
journalists for what he considers to be false reporting, even as he lost
other media-related suits.</p>
<p>The president-elect reiterated his plan to impose tariffs against
imports from some of the U.S.’ biggest trading partners.</p>
<p>“Tariffs will make our country rich,” he contended, although
individual importers pay the fees and often pass on their costs to
customers buying the goods.</p>

Age of Electrons Has Arrived, but Maybe Not for the Right Reasons</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
The transition to clean energy is largely a shift from molecules to
electrons — gasoline in the tank is out, electricity stored in a battery
cell is in. It follows, then, that as the transition progresses, the
balance of power in the energy industry will shift from oil and gas
production to electricity generation.
</p>
<p>
We may look back on 2024 as the year the scales tipped. Among the top
260 publicly listed energy companies, utilities’ capital expenditures
around the globe were slightly higher this year than oil and gas
spending, according to a
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bcg-on-energy_north-america-utilities-data-center-demand-activity-7265316389505118208-_MST/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
analysis from Boston Consulting Group</u></a>, and the authors expect
the trend to grow through the end of the decade. But it wasn’t a sudden
spike in EV adoption or home electrification or some other climate
solution that put utility spending in the lead. It was the rise in data
centers.
</p>
<p>
“When we went through all the data, all the 260 companies, it was the
data centers that were having the biggest impact, most definitely,”
Rebecca Fitz, a partner and director at Boston Consulting Group and lead
author of the report, told me. “I’ve been in this sector for a long
time, and to have such a rapid change in demand outlook, coupled with

<p>
The finding was the surprise headline of an annual report that Fitz’
group has completed for the past three years called “Follow the
Capital,” an analysis of what’s driving changes in capital supply and
demand in the energy sector using data culled from publicly available
sources. Data for prior years comes from regulatory and investor
fillings. Future years are modeled using public announcements, plans
filed with regulators, and a few conservative assumptions, Fitz told me.
</p>
<p>
Surging demand for electricity from data centers was perhaps the biggest
energy story of 2024, and the trend seemed to accelerate as the year
went on. In just the past few months, almost every major tech company
has signed an agreement to buy power from a nuclear plant, either
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear" target="_self"><u>reviving
formerly shuttered reactors</u></a> or
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helping
to build new ones</u></a>. GE Vernova, which manufactures energy
generation equipment,
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_investor_update_transcript_12102024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported
last week</u></a> that it had secured contracts for 9 gigawatts’ worth
of new gas turbines since its previous quarterly report in October,
“tied to both load growth in the U.S and … serving the hyperscaler
demand associated with AI.” As the “Follow the Capital” authors were
wrapping up this year’s edition in November, they found that U.S.
utilities had added $50 billion in planned capex during the third
quarter alone, mostly due to data center demand growth.
</p>
<p>
Data center demand isn’t the only factor playing into the above chart.
Though utility spending is definitely up, oil and gas companies are also
reining in capex growth in favor of shareholder returns, Fitz told me.
But oil and gas also sees the winds changing and is making moves to get
into the power business. Two weeks ago,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/bbWeRY9jK5c?t=1800s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>during
a panel hosted by the Atlantic Council</u></a>, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth
said the company was “looking at possible solutions to build large-scale
power generation” that would serve data centers directly, rather than
feed into the grid, so that regular electricity ratepayers would not
shoulder the costs. “There’s sensitivity to increasing electricity rates
for the average person just for the benefit of a few of these tech
companies,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Beating Chevron to the punch, last week ExxonMobil
<a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/what-we-do/delivering-industrial-solutions/carbon-capture-and-storage/steel-ammonia-ai-what-cant-ccs-help-decarbonize" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
that it was “moving fast” on this exact type of project, designing a
natural gas plant that would “use carbon capture to remove more than 90%
of the associated CO2 emissions” and directly power data centers without
connecting to the grid.
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt that most of the oil and gas sector is looking at
opportunities in this area,” said Fitz.
</p>
<p>
Though the report covers global companies and spending, the data center
demand signal is hyperlocal. Among the 30 largest North American
utilities, 65% of demand growth is concentrated within just six of them,
the report says. Though the report does not name the companies, Fitz
told me that Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio were seeing the
most aggressive plans.
</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence boosters often argue that this demand pull is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>boon
for the energy transition</u></a>. By ushering in the age of electrons,
the logic goes, tech companies with deep pockets can drive the first
deployments of new clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear and
geothermal power plants. These early deployments would then help lower
costs and give rise to cheaper, cleaner electricity for the rest of us
average energy consumers and our future electric cars, stoves, and water
heaters.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not the only potential outcome. “Follow the Capital” found
that when the six utilities most affected by demand growth recently
revised their integrated resource plans, they increased the amount of
natural gas generation they planned to add from 26% of total new
generation to 31%. As GE Vernova reported, orders for gas generators are
skyrocketing. “I can’t think of a time that the gas business has had
more fun than they’re having right now,” the company’s CEO Scott Strazik
said during a recent investor update.
</p>
<p>
As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>,
the industry is turning to natural gas plants because they can run 24/7
and they are not as dependent on transmission lines as renewables are,
so they can be built faster and more cheaply. Renewables paired with
energy storage are only competitive with gas if there’s infrastructure
to support it, sources told him.
</p>
<p>
The age of electrons may be nigh, but whether it helps to stop climate
change is a separate question altogether.

<h2 id="us-expands-reach-against-islamic-state-in-syria">US expands
reach against Islamic State in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The United States is moving to fill the power vacuum in
central Syria, worried the Islamic State terror group is looking to
exploit the victory of Syrian rebels over forces loyal to former
President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>U.S. warplanes Monday targeted IS camps and operatives in central
Syria, marking at least the second time the U.S. has hit the terror
group in areas formerly patrolled by Assad’s forces that had backing
from Russian troops and airpower.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle
East, said the latest round of airstrikes targeted leaders, operatives
and camps “in former regime and Russian-controlled areas.”</p>
<p>The goal, CENTCOM said, is to ensure “pressure is maintained” against
IS.</p>
<p>CENTCOM and Pentagon officials said Monday initial assessments
indicated the strikes killed12 IS members and that no civilians were
killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Neither CENTCOM nor the Pentagon offered additional details about the
targets of Monday’s airstrikes or their operational value.</p>
<p>The new strikes come just over a week after CENTCOM launched more
than a dozen strikes against 75 IS targets in five locations across
central Syria.</p>
<p>Officials at the time said the targets included “a significant
gathering of ISIS fighters and leaders.”</p>
<p>Pentagon officials on Monday said the U.S. would carry out additional
strikes as needed.</p>
<p>“In as much as CENTCOM sees a potential threat posed by ISIS, and to
mitigate their ability to be able to resurge, you’re going to see these
strikes,” said Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder, using
another acronym for the terror group.</p>
<p>Until the collapse of the Assad regime, however, much of central
Syria was a no-go zone for U.S. forces and their Syrian allies.</p>
<p>“One of the big factors that has changed in Syria is the airspace,”
Ryder told reporters Monday. “It previously had Syrian regime and
Russian air defenses, which would preclude in many cases our ability to
or desirability to go into those areas.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials and independent analysts have long warned of a growing
IS threat in areas of Syria under Assad’s control.</p>
<p>A United Nations report issued earlier this year, based on
intelligence from member states, warned the central Syria desert had
become “a logistics and operations hub with 500 to 600 fighters.”</p>
<p>More recently, U.S. officials warned that IS had been exploiting the
lack of pressure from Syrian and Russian forces to plan attacks across
the West.</p>
<p>IS has “used a base of operations in central Syria to drive external
plotting, turning this desert location into the current locus of
plotting against the West, including the United States,” Brett Holmgren,
acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said last
month.</p>

id="former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-lying-about-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens">Former
FBI informant pleads guilty to lying about bribery scheme involving
Bidens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — A former FBI informant pleaded guilty Monday to lying
about a phony bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son
Hunter that became central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in
Congress. </p>
<p>Alexander Smirnov entered his plea to a felony charge in connection
with the bogus story, along with a tax evasion charge stemming from a
separate indictment accusing him of concealing millions of dollars of
income. </p>
<p>An attorney for Smirnov declined to comment after the hearing in Los
Angeles federal court. </p>
<p>Prosecutors and the defense have agreed to recommend a sentence of
between four and six years in prison when he’s sentenced next
month. </p>
<p>Smirnov will get credit for the time he has served since his February
arrest on charges that he told his FBI handler that executives from the
Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter
Biden $5 million each around 2015. </p>
<p>Smirnov had been an informant for more than a decade when he made the
explosive allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, after “expressing
bias” about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, prosecutors
said. </p>
<p>But Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting
in 2017, according to court documents. An FBI field office investigated
the allegations and recommended the case be closed in August 2020,
according to charging documents. </p>
<p>No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted
bribes as president or in his previous office as vice president. </p>
<p>While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment,
his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to
investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House
impeachment inquiry into Biden. Before Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had
demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified
allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were
true. </p>
<p>During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also
claimed the Russians probably had recordings of Hunter Biden because a
hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under
their control — information he said was passed along to him by four
high-level Russian officials. </p>
<p>But Hunter Biden had never traveled to Ukraine, according to
Smirnov’s indictment. </p>
<p>Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated
officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that
“officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing
a story” about Hunter Biden. </p>
<p>The case against Smirnov was brought by special counsel David Weiss,
who also prosecuted Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. Hunter Biden
was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial
in the gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in the tax case.
But he was pardoned this month by his father, who said he believed “raw
politics has infected this process, and it led to a miscarriage of
justice.”</p>

id="teacher-teenage-student-fatally-shot-at-christian-school-in-wisconsin">Teacher,
teenage student fatally shot at Christian school in Wisconsin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A teenage student opened fire with a handgun Monday at a Christian
school in Wisconsin, killing a teacher and another teenager during the
final week before Christmas break. The shooter also died, police
said. </p>
<p>The shooter also wounded six others at Abundant Life Christian
School, including two students, who were in critical condition, Madison
Police Chief Shon Barnes said. A teacher and three students were taken
to a hospital with less serious injuries, and two of them had been
released by Monday evening. </p>
<p>“Every child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a
victim forever. … We need to figure out and try to piece together what
exactly happened,” Barnes said. </p>
<p>Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for
Abundant Life Christian School, said students “handled themselves
magnificently.” </p>
<p>She said when the school practices safety routines, which it had done
just before the school year, leaders always announce that it is a drill.
That didn’t happen Monday. </p>
<p>“When they heard, ‘Lockdown, lockdown,’ they knew it was real,” she
said. </p>
<p>The shooter was a 17-year-old female student, a law enforcement
official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to
discuss the investigation and spoke to the AP on the condition of
anonymity. </p>
<p>Police said the shooter was dead by apparent suicide when officers
arrived. Barnes declined to give details about the shooter, partly out
of respect for the family. With a few rare exceptions, a 17-year-old
can’t legally possess a gun in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Barnes said investigators might have enough information to release
more details about the shooter in another press conference later
Monday. </p>
<p>He also warned people against sharing unconfirmed reports on social
media about the shooter’s identity. </p>
<p>“What that does is it helps erode the trust in this process,” he
said. </p>
<p>Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school —
prekindergarten through high school — with approximately 420 students in
Madison, the state capital. </p>
<p>Wiers said the school does not have metal detectors but uses other
security measures, including cameras. </p>
<p>Children and families were reunited at a medical building about a
mile away from the school. Parents pressed children against their chests
while others squeezed hands and shoulders as they walked side by side.
One girl was comforted with an adult-size coat around her shoulders as
she moved to a parking lot teeming with police vehicles. </p>
<p>A motive for the shooting was not immediately known, but Barnes said
officials were talking with the parents of the suspected shooter and
they were cooperating. He also said he didn’t know if the people shot
had been targeted. </p>
<p>“I don’t know why, and I feel like if we did know why, we could stop
these things from happening,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>A search warrant was issued Monday to a Madison home, he said. </p>
<p>Rapid response</p>
<p>Someone from the school called 911 to report an active shooter
shortly before 11 a.m. First responders who were in training just 3
miles (5 kilometers) away dashed to the school for an actual emergency,
Barnes said. They arrived 3 minutes after the initial call and went into
the building immediately. </p>
<p>Classes had been taking place when the shooting happened, Barnes
said. He declined to say where exactly in the school it happened. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooter used a 9 mm pistol, a law
enforcement official told the AP on the condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Police blocked off roads around the school, and federal agents were
at the scene to assist local law enforcement. No shots were fired by
police. </p>
<p>Abundant Life asked for prayers in a brief Facebook post. </p>
<p>Wiers said the school’s goal is to have staff get together early in
the week and have community opportunities for students to reconnect
before the winter break, but it’s still to be decided whether they will
resume classes this week. </p>
<p>Bethany Highman, the mother of a student, rushed to the school and
learned over FaceTime that her daughter was OK. </p>
<p>“As soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute. Nothing else
matters,” Highman said. “There’s nobody around you. You just bolt for
the door and try to do everything you can as a parent to be with your
kids.” </p>
<p>In a statement, President Joe Biden cited the tragedy in calling on
Congress to pass universal background checks, a national red flag law
and certain gun restrictions. </p>
<p>“We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children,
their families, and tears entire communities apart,” Biden said. </p>
<p>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said it’s “unthinkable” that a child or
teacher would go to school and never return home. </p>
<p>The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in
recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut;
Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. </p>
<p>The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and
frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to
doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings
have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. </p>
<p>Firearms were the leading cause of death among children in 2020 and
2021, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care
issues. </p>
<p>Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said the country needs to do more
to prevent gun violence. </p>
<p>“I hoped that this day would never come to Madison,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="taiwan-receives-first-batch-of-us-made-abrams-tanks">Taiwan
receives first batch of US-made Abrams tanks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan has received 38 advanced Abrams battle tanks
from the United States, the defense ministry said Monday, reportedly the
island’s first new tanks in 30 years.</p>
<p>Washington has long been Taipei’s most important ally and biggest
arms supplier — angering Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its own
territory.</p>
<p>The M1A2 tanks — the first batch of 108 ordered in 2019 — arrived in
Taiwan late Sunday and were transferred to an army training base in
Hsinchu, south of the capital Taipei, the defense ministry said.</p>
<p>The M1A2s are the first new tanks to be delivered to Taiwan in 30
years, the semi-official Central News Agency said.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s current tank force consists of around 1,000 Taiwan-made CM
11 Brave Tiger and U.S.-made M60A3 tanks, technology that is
increasingly obsolete.</p>
<p>Abrams tanks, which are among the heaviest in the world, are a
mainstay of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Taiwan faces the constant threat of an invasion by China, which has
refused to rule out using force to bring the self-ruled island under its
control.</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry on Monday urged the United States to “stop
arming Taiwan… and supporting Taiwan independence forces.”</p>
<p>“The Taiwan authorities’ attempt to seek independence through force
and foreign help is doomed to fail,” ministry spokesman Lin Jian
said.</p>
<p>“China will firmly defend its national sovereignty, security and
territorial integrity.”</p>
<p>While it has a home-grown defense industry and has been upgrading its
equipment, Taiwan relies heavily on U.S. arms sales to bolster its
security capabilities.</p>
<p>Taiwan requested the state-of-the-art M1A2 tanks in 2019, allocating
the equivalent of more than $1.2 billion for them. The rest of the order
is expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, an army official told
AFP.</p>
<p>While U.S. arms supplies to Taiwan are enshrined into law, a massive
backlog caused by Covid-19 supply chain disruptions and U.S. weapons
shipments to Ukraine and Israel have slowed deliveries to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The backlog now exceeds $21 billion, according to Washington think
tank Cato Institute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiwan would be massively outgunned in terms of troop numbers and
firepower in any war with China and in recent years has increased
spending on its military.</p>
<p>Taipei allocated a record $19 billion for 2024 and next year’s budget
is set to hit a new high as it seeks to bolster its defense
approach.</p>
<p>China has increased military pressure on Taiwan in recent years,
regularly deploying fighter jets and warships around the island.</p>
<p>Taiwanese authorities said last week that China had held its biggest
maritime drills in years, with around 90 ships deployed from near the
southern islands of Japan to the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The vessels simulated attacks on foreign ships and practiced
blockading sea routes, a Taiwan security official said previously.</p>
<p>Beijing did not confirm the drills and its defense ministry did not
say whether the maneuvers had taken place when asked at a press
conference on Friday.</p>

Thousands of people could be dead in the small island region of Mayotte

home to some 300,000, are French territory but located in the Indian

With the end of President Biden’s term rapidly approaching, his
administration is racing to finalize some key environmental decisions
and finance deals. For example, the Energy Department’s Loan Programs
Office has a handful of “conditional” commitments for clean tech (like a
$6.6 billion loan to Rivian, and a $7.5 billion loan for a battery plant
built by the Stellantis and Samsung joint venture) that are in limbo and
could be nixed by the Trump administration. Officials are “working hard
to make the loan guarantees and loan agreements as airtight as
possible,” a former policy adviser for the LPO

soon as this week</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency on
whether California can ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.
Reports suggest the agency will grant its approval, which would also
apply to about a dozen other states. Trump is expected to reverse the
rule, likely setting up a long legal battle.

<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump hasn’t taken office yet, but the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/politics/elon-musk-trump-campaign-finance-filings/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quarter
of a billion dollars</u></a> Elon Musk invested in Trump’s victory is
already paying off in ways large and small. On Friday, Reuters
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-recommends-scrapping-car-crash-reporting-requirement-opposed-by-2024-12-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that the Trump transition team is looking to scrap a National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration crash-reporting requirement, “a move that
could cripple the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the
safety of vehicles with automated-driving systems.” Tesla finds this
requirement irksome, and lo, it may soon disappear.
</p>
<p>
In the scope of Musk’s emerging sway over the Trump administration and
the course of federal policy in the coming years, it’s a relatively
minor story of potentially corrupt influence and the subversion of the
public interest. But an even more disturbing picture of Musk’s full
priority set is coming into focus.
</p>
<p>
Musk, the richest human being in history (his net worth
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/business/elon-musk-400-billion-net-worth/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
tops</u></a> $400 billion), may soon exercise a control over government
policy unprecedented for a private citizen, which as recently as a year
or so ago might have seemed like a net positive for the fight against
climate change. Until the relatively immediate present, Musk was rightly
counted as a hero of that battle. Whether or not you accept
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h4ZoGASM8bI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
claim</u></a> that “I’ve done more for the environment than any single
human on Earth,” Musk has certainly done more than anyone to promote the
adoption of electric vehicles. And no public figure could — if he wanted
— have more ability to convince conservatives in general, and Donald
Trump in particular, to accept the reality of climate change and commit
to doing something about it than he does.
</p>
<p>
But that is not what Elon Musk wants. It is becoming clear that in
pursuit of his own objectives — money, power, domination over others,
personal aggrandizement, and the realization of
<a href="https://www.spacex.com/media/making_life_multiplanetary_transcript_2017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
dream</u></a> of making humanity a “multi-planet species” — Musk is
content not just to set aside the fight against climate change, but to
actively undermine it.
</p>
<p>
While Musk has not made any grand announcement declaring that he no
longer cares about climate, there is considerable evidence to suggest he
does not. In
<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
rambling interview</u></a> with Trump this August, Musk said that his
views on the fossil fuel industry are “probably different from what most
people would assume.” He explained that “I don’t think we should vilify
the oil and gas industry,” and although over time we should move toward
sustainable energy, “we still have quite a bit of time … we don’t need
to rush and we don’t need to stop farmers from farming or prevent people
from having steaks.”
</p>
<p>
Which is almost exactly what any
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis" target="_self"><u>fossil
fuel CEO</u></a> would say.
</p>
<p>
It certainly marks a rhetorical shift for someone who once
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/Elon-Musk-thinks-we-need-a-popular-uprising-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry/articleshow/55233184.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated</u></a>
a “popular uprising” against fossil fuel companies. One might object
that whatever he says in interviews, he’s still the CEO of America’s
largest EV manufacturer. And Tesla no doubt remains a company filled
with people committed to combating climate change who see their work as
a key part of that effort.
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/Tesla-Master-Plan-Part-3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
third iteration</u></a> of the company’s “Master Plan,” released last
year, describes what it believes is necessary to “fully electrify the
economy and eliminate fossil fuel use.”
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t seem to reflect the CEO’s own thinking. The
<em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/elon-musk-climate-change-worldview-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that earlier this year, Musk killed plans to create an affordable Tesla
that could have greatly expanded the reach of EVs in the U.S., opting
instead to make further investments in luxury cars and artificial
intelligence. (To add insult to injury, Reuters first reported in April
that the car had been canceled, but Musk said that the outlet was
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2#:~:text=Tesla%20has%20denied%20the%20reporting.%20In%20a%20post%20on%20the%20social%20network%20X%2C%20Elon%20Musk%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20lying%20(again).%E2%80%9D%20He%20later%20added%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20dying.%E2%80%9D" target="_self"><u>lying</u></a>.”)
“The internal deliberations over the so-called Tesla Model 2,” said the
<em><em>Post</em></em>, “reflect what sources close to Musk describe as
a significant shift in the billionaire’s attitude toward climate
change.”
</p>
<p>
That’s apparent in what may be the single most important decision Trump
and congressional Republicans will have to make with regard to EVs:
whether to kill the $7,500 EV subsidy revived and expanded by the
Inflation Reduction Act. If Musk wanted to, he could almost certainly
convince Trump that the subsidies ought to remain in place. But he
doesn’t; this summer he said on an earnings call that while eliminating
the subsidies might cost Tesla some sales, “long term, it probably
actually helps” because it would be “devastating for our competitors.”
Or as he said in
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813112958157005259" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
tweet</u></a>, “Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, Musk favors a policy change that will reduce overall
adoption of EVs, because it will hurt his competition, perhaps driving
some of his competitors out of the EV market entirely. Bad for the
climate, but good for Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>
Then we have the rest of the Trump administration’s agenda to roll back
climate progress. To date there is zero evidence that Musk has suggested
that Trump dial back his “drill, baby, drill” agenda or appoint
administration figures who are anything less than fossil fuel
enthusiasts. Quite the opposite: When Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-expedited-permitting" target="_blank">posted
on Truth Social</a> that “Any person or company investing ONE BILLION
DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of America, will receive fully
expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to,
all Environmental approvals,” Musk responded by
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1866571568266219998" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tweeting</u></a>,
“This is awesome.”
</p>
<p>
That it isn’t in Trump’s power to single-handedly waive “all
Environmental approvals” isn’t the point, so much as the fact that Musk
thrills to the idea of the government no longer bothering to enforce
environmental laws. While the “Department of Government Efficiency”
Trump has tasked Musk with creating is neither a department, nor part of
the government, nor devoted to efficiency, it nonetheless stands as a
symbol of Musk’s close relationship with Trump and his ability to
influence Trump’s decisions, particularly given how little Trump
actually cares about policy areas other than immigration and foreign
trade. It has become hard to envision Musk acting as anything other than
an accelerant on Trump’s worst environmental instincts.
</p>
<p>
Musk’s shift to the right will continue to have serious national
consequences in both government policy and public debate. He bought
Twitter in 2022 with the stated intention of removing much of its
content moderation in the name of “free speech,” with the predictable
result that the renamed X quickly became a sewer of far-right extremism
and misinformation of all kinds. As multiple
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10122024/todays-climate-climate-misinformation-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analyses</u></a>
have
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-science-social-media-a7e2e3214abb4470dcb6e2837aa39c2e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shown</u></a>,
climate denialism and deceit have proliferated on X, making it one of
the premier vectors of influence for those who would thwart efforts to
address the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
There is no reason to believe that this concerns Musk in any way. The
man who once had the key insight that the way to fight climate change
was to make EVs cool now thinks nothing is cooler than getting retweets
and likes from the right-wing trolls who consider him their king.
</p>
<p>
At this point, one might even question whether Musk
<em><em>ever</em></em> cared about climate change, or if concern about
warming was just an engine that he realized could make him rich and feed
his grandiose dreams of world domination. The answer to that question
is: It doesn’t matter. Whatever he might once have thought, Musk has
been transformed. He is no longer a force for good in the climate fight;
instead, he’ll be one more obstacle to ensuring the future of the
planet. If only he didn’t have the ability to do so much damage.

Harris thank donors, urge them to stay engaged after tough loss to
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on
Sunday thanked deep-pocketed Democratic donors who raised record sums in
last month’s election loss to President-elect Donald Trump and urged
them not to lose hope and to remain politically engaged.</p>
<p>Biden and Harris, along with their spouses, in remarks at the
Democratic National Committee holiday reception sought to buck up key
donors who the Democratic Party needs to stay committed as it tries to
pick up the pieces. Republicans scored a decisive victory taking the
White House and Senate while maintaining control of the House in an
election where donors of all political stripes spent about $4.7
billion.</p>
<p>“We all get knocked down. My dad would say when you get knocked down,
you just got to get up,” Biden said. “The measure of a person or a party
is how fast they get back up.”</p>
<p>Harris, who stepped in as the party’s presidential nominee after
Biden ended his campaign in July following his disastrous debate
performance, praised donors for putting their time — and checkbooks —
into backing her and Democrats that they believed in.</p>
<p>Democrats, their allied super PACs and other groups raised about $2.9
billion, compared to about $1.8 billion for the Republicans. Harris
noted that Democrats raised a whopping $700 million over just 700 events
organized by the Democratic finance committee.</p>
<p>“You rallied, you opened your homes, you reached out to your friends
and your family,” said Harris, who will soon begin weighing in earnest
her own future and whether to make another White House run. “You put
your personal capital — and by that I mean your relationships — at stake
to talk with people because you care so deeply, and you connected with
people and took the time to remind them of what is at stake and what was
at stake.”</p>
<p>While Biden acknowledged the sting that Democrats continue to feel
about last month’s loss, he said they should take pride in what they
accomplished.</p>
<p>The administration’s signature achievements include a $1 trillion
bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost
semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., and a surge in federal
environmental spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden
signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic
votes.</p>
<p>“We could never have gotten as much done as we did without you,”
Biden said. “You not only contributed to the campaign, but you did
something, I think, even more important. You were willing to lend your
names, your reputation, your character to the effort.”</p>
<p>Biden said that he intended to remain engaged with party politics
once he leaves office on Jan. 20. He also predicted that he expected
Harris would remain a central character in the party’s future.</p>
<p>“You’re not going anywhere kid. We aren’t letting you,” Biden said to
Harris.</p>

across US bring heavy snow, dangerous ice, tornado in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Omaha, Nebraska — A tornado near a mall in central California swept
up cars, uprooted trees and sent several people to the hospital. In San
Francisco, authorities issued the first-ever tornado warning.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, inclement weather plagued areas of the U.S., with
dangerous conditions including heavy snow in upstate New York, a major
ice storm in Midwest states and severe weather warnings around Lake
Tahoe. </p>
<p>The ice storm beginning Friday evening created treacherous driving
conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska Friday and into Saturday and
prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and
trucks slid off the road. In upstate New York, more than 33 inches (84
centimeters) was reported near Orchard Park, which is often a landing
point for lake-effect snow.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a tornado touched down near a shopping mall in Scotts
Valley, California, about 110 kilometers south of San Francisco, around
1:40 p.m. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility
poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police
Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, some trees toppled onto cars and streets and
damaged roofs. The  </p>
<p>damage was due to 129-kph straight-line winds, not a tornado, weather
 </p>
<p>service meteorologist Dalton Behringer said Sunday.</p>
<p>Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the weather service’s office in
Monterey, California, said the warning of a possible tornado in San
Francisco was a first for the city, noting an advanced alert did not go
out before the last tornado struck nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a warning
in 2005,” said Gass, who was not there at the time.</p>
<p>The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take
shelter, but few people have basements in the area.</p>
<p>More than 30 centimeters of snow fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts,
and 181-kph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort
south of Yosemite National Park, according to the weather service’s
office in Reno, Nevada. Up to 90 centimeters of snow was forecast for
the Sierra Nevada mountaintops.</p>
<p>The weekend Tahoe Live music festival at Palisades Tahoe ski resort
in California went ahead as planned in spite of a snowstorm Saturday.
Lil Wayne and Diplo were scheduled to perform Sunday, the festival’s
website said. An avalanche warning was in effect at least until Monday
morning in the area.</p>
<p>Interstate 80 was closed along a 130-kilometer stretch from
Applegate, California, to the Nevada line just west of Reno on Saturday.
The California Highway Patrol reopened the road in the afternoon for
passenger vehicles with chains or four-wheel drive and snow tires.</p>
<p>The severe weather in the Midwest resulted in at least one death. The
Washington County Sheriff’s office in Nebraska said a 57-year-old woman
died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington
and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor
injuries.</p>
<p>Businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as temperatures rose
high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places.</p>
<p>“Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it
temporary,” said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people in western Washington state lost
electricity Saturday as the system delivered rain and gusty winds, local
news outlets reported.</p>

<p>More than 100 children, some of whom have serious health issues, were
then taken on a roughly 45-minute flight near the city before landing
back at Denver International Airport and being towed to a hangar
transformed by United Airlines employees and volunteers into the North
Pole.</p>
<p>Streamers, paper snowflakes and tufts of cotton resembling feathery
snow dotted the plane and seats. Flight personnel paraded a bubble
machine up and down the aisle to shouts of “bubbles, bubbles, bubbles”
from the excited children. Holiday songs played in the background and
there were apple snacks and juice for all.</p>
<p>Before landing, the children were asked to close their window shades.
When they opened, the kids were met by the sight of a waiting Santa and
Mrs. Claus and a host of elves. An ice cream truck was on hand and the
children received gifts.</p>
<p>Bryce Bosley, 6, was tickled to see Santa and all the North Pole had
to offer.</p>
<p>“The North Pole is fun because there’s games, food, and all the
activities are really fun,” he said.</p>
<p>United Capt. Bob Zimmermann, the holiday flight’s pilot, was struck
by the joy and wonder of the youngsters.</p>
<p>“Throughout the year I’ll think of the fantasy flight,” he said.
“When life seems to get tough or I want to complain about something, I
remember these kids and the joy and the love and what this feels like,
and it just keeps my life in perspective.”</p>
<p>United partnered with Make-A-Wish Colorado, Girls Inc., Children’s
Hospital Colorado and Rocky Mountain Down Syndrome Association to invite
Denver-area kids ages 3 to 10 years on the flight.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, United has staged its annual “fantasy
flights” to fictional North Poles at airports around the world to bring
holiday cheer to children and their families.</p>
<p>This year they took place in 13 cities, starting Dec. 5 in Honolulu
and then in Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San
Francisco, Tokyo, Cleveland and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the
island of Guam. Newark, New Jersey, also had a flight Saturday.</p>
<p>Jonna McGrath, United’s vice president for operations at its Denver
hub, has participated in 29 flights and said it is one of her favorite
days of the year.</p>
<p>“It gives them a day where they are away from some of the challenges
they face in their day-to-day life,” said McGrath, who was dressed as an
elf. “Bringing a little magic and some gifts to their holiday season is
something they’ll never forget.”</p>

id="tis-the-season-for-roasting-chestnuts.-but-in-us-native-ones-are-almost-gone">’Tis
the season for roasting chestnuts. But in US, native ones are almost
gone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut
on city sidewalks. It’s no longer the variety whose smell some people
associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it’s
virtually extinct. </p>
<p>But memories of the American chestnut’s legacy keep resurfacing for
the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that
paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the
photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags
of nuts cooked on charcoal. </p>
<p>“You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to
utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in
virtually every aspect of the lives of people,” said Sara Fern
Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut
Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once
did. </p>
<p>Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many
chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with
attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the
invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If
and when they do find the right variety, they’ll need to figure out how
to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from
climate change, globalization and development. </p>
<p>Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American
chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems
underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal
blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties,
like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to
the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter
snacking. </p>
<p>Still, American chestnut trees are better-suited for timber, they’re
culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an
important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a
reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans
alike. “It was really a pretty significant species to lose,” said Amy
Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree’s
genetics. “The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest
ecosystem is.” </p>
<p>The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for
decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with
the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said
breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance
involves several different genes, and it has proven hard to separate
them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. </p>
<p>To speed the process, some scientists have been working on
genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their
immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up
involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that
scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through
the regulatory process as soon as this year. </p>
<p>“It kind of stinks that it happened because now it’s taking a little
bit longer than we had hoped,” said Linda McGuigan, a research support
specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are
continuing to pursue many avenues. </p>
<p>“I don’t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,”
Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic
modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity
for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she
thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight
resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another
big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful
tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to
New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a
warming planet is changing habitat around the world? </p>
<p>A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to
answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared
them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance
that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset
warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while
keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say it’s revolutionary” for teams
at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed
data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure
out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across
the country. </p>
<p>Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of
Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American
chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it
“robust and well supported” and “critically important to the success of
the chestnut.” </p>
<p>Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the
findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with
real-world experiments. “I think with advancements in genetics, they can
probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all
of that takes time and effort, right?” </p>
<p>For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their
lifetimes. It’s a lesson that became clear for the community when
pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard
both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their
research for years as lab manager at SUNY’s college of environmental
science and forestry. </p>
<p>“The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,” McGuigan
said. “I want to do something good for the future, for my children.”</p>

id="kraven-the-hunter-flops-while-moana-2-tops-the-box-office-again">‘Kraven
the Hunter’ flops while ‘Moana 2’ tops the box office again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Spider-Man spinoff “Kraven the Hunter” got off to a disastrous
start in North American theaters this weekend. </p>
<p>The movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson earned only $11 million,
according to studio estimates Sunday, making it one of the worst
openings for a Marvel-adjacent property. Its box office take was even
less than the film “Madame Web.” </p>
<p>The weekend’s other major studio release was Warner Bros.’ animated
“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” which made $4.6
million. Made for about $30 million, the movie is set 183 years before
the events of “The Lord of the Rings” films and was fast-tracked to
ensure New Line did not lose the rights to Tolkien’s novels. Peter
Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have been working on future
live-action films for the franchise. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the top of the charts again belonged to “Moana 2” and
“Wicked.” </p>
<p>“Moana” added $26.6 million to its domestic total in its third
weekend and $57.2 million internationally, bringing its global tally to
$717 million. It’s now the fourth highest grossing film of the year,
surpassing “Dune: Part Two.” </p>
<p>“Wicked,” which is in its fourth weekend, brought in another $22.5
million to take second place. The Universal musical has made over $359
million domestically and over $500 million worldwide. </p>
<p>“Gladiator II” also made $7.8 million, bringing its domestic total to
$145.9 million in four weeks. </p>
<p>“Kraven the Hunter” is the latest misfire from Sony in its attempt to
mine the Spider-Man universe for spin-off franchises without the
lucrative web slinger himself. “Kraven” joins “Madame Web” and “Morbius”
in franchise additions that fell flat with both audiences and critics.
The one exception on this rollercoaster journey has been the “Venom”
trilogy, which has made over $1.8 billion worldwide. </p>
<p>The R-rated “Kraven the Hunter” was directed by J.C. Chandor and
faced a number of delays, partly due to the Hollywood strikes. It was
shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in
January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was
co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its
potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15%
“fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from
opening weekend audiences. </p>
<p>“It’s not always a guarantee that you’ll be able to connect with
audiences when you have a spinoff character,” said Paul Dergarabedian,
the senior media analyst for Comscore. “General audiences seem to want
to know exactly what they’re getting.” </p>
<p>Several awards contenders opened in limited release over the weekend,
including Paramount’s “September 5” about ABC’s coverage of the Munich
Olympics hostage crisis. Amazon MGM and Orion’s “Nickel Boys,” based on
Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-winner about an abusive reform school in
Florida, opened in two theaters in New York. It averaged $30,422 per
screen and will be expanding to Los Angeles before going nationwide in
the coming weeks. </p>
<p>Some big hitters are on the way in the home stretch of the 2024 box
office. “Mufasa” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” will hit in the coming weeks
along with a bevy of arthouse and adult releases like “Babygirl,”
“Nosferatu” and “A Complete Unknown.” </p>
<p>The box office has seen a dramatic recovery since June, when it was
down nearly 28% from the previous year. The deficit now stands at
4.8%. </p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Moana 2,” $26.6 million. </p></li>
<li><p>“Wicked,” $22.5 million. </p></li>

id="incoming-national-security-adviser-calls-for-explanation-of-us-drone-sightings">Incoming
national security adviser calls for explanation of US drone
sightings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security
adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones
flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill
intent is involved.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join
Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January
20, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We need to get to the
bottom of it.”</p>
<p>For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders
New York City, and other states to the north and south along the
Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed
drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated.</p>
<p>All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the
unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the
deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern
coastal waters.</p>
<p>Waltz called them “long-loitering, could-be dangerous” drones. He
credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying
to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no
explanation himself.</p>
<p>“We need more transparency,” Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a
Democrat, told the CBS show. “This can’t be the future.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of
Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that
most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state
with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and
posed no national security threat.</p>
<p>An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50
local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100
of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit
further investigation.</p>
<p>“The combination of efforts so far … to include technical equipment,
tip line information and noted consults has … not found any evidence to
support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities,” the official
said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight
paths.</p>
<p>The official said more investigations are under way to look at the
remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence.</p>
<p>“We can’t ignore the sightings that have been there,” the official
said. “We’re doing our best to find the origin of those drone
activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction” in the
number of claimed drone sightings.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military
bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence
that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security
officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been
operating the unexplained drones.</p>
<p>State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed
concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media
Friday that he had seen “what appeared to be dozens of large drones in
the sky” above his residence in the state. “The public is growing
increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of
transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.”</p>
<p>President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden
administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and
that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative
Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the
White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been “dismissive.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey
officials radar technology with an “electro-optical infrared camera
system” to track the devices.</p>
<p>Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said
an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal
activity.</p>
<p>“To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that
many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are
being operated lawfully,” Kirby said.</p>

drone sightings keep happening in New Jersey - What we know… and don’t
know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over
parts of New Jersey and the East Coast in recent weeks, sparking
speculation and concern over who sent them and why.</p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for
answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a
drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.</p>
<p>Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones
don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and
municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who
can fly the unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked
residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have
about the drones.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?</p>
<p>Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting
in November.</p>
<p>At first they were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River,
which feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer,
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.</p>
<p>But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the
Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and
over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.</p>
<p>The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding
officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Guard lifeboat near
Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Federal officials offer assurances that drones don’t pose a
threat</p>
<p>The growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden
administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing
with the matter more aggressively.</p>
<p>In a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White
House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies
sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or
public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor.</p>
<p>An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground
rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable
but added, “I think there has been a slight overreaction.”</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the
military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of
Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones
are not of foreign origin — remained unchanged.</p>
<p>New Jersey congressman wants the military to take action</p>
<p>A New Jersey congressman has urged the Pentagon to authorize the use
of force to bring down one or more drones to try to figure out who
deployed them.</p>
<p>The objects could be downed over the ocean or in an unpopulated area
on land, Smith said Saturday at a news conference.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we bag at least one of these drones and get to the bottom
of it?” Smith said.</p>
<p>Rep. Jeff Van Drew, another Republican Jersey Shore-area congressman,
has also called for the military to shoot down the drones.</p>
<p>Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said people should not take it
into their own hands to shoot down drones, which would break state and
federal laws.</p>
<p>Drones have been spotted over New York City</p>
<p>Drone sightings have now been reported in New York, where a permit is
required, and Mayor Eric Adams said the city was investigating and
collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.</p>
<p>The runways at Stewart International Airport — about 60 miles (100
kilometers) north of the city — were shut down for about one hour Friday
night because of drone activity in the airspace, Gov. Kathy Hochul
said.</p>
<p>“This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>The governor called on Congress to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of
drones and give more investigative authority to state and local law
enforcement.</p>
<p>“Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is
essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local
officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional
federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure
the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”</p>
<p>Are these drones dangerous?</p>
<p>The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings
shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown
lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.</p>
<p>The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint
statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national
security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of
Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8
meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off.
This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists, and
she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as
helicopter and radio.</p>
<p>Who sent the drones?</p>
<p>Authorities say they do not know.</p>
<p>The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the
sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has
been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in
a coordinated effort.</p>
<p>Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the
drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents.</p>
<p>Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have
found no evidence to support those concerns, but Rep. Smith on Saturday
echoed such speculation.</p>
<p>“The elusive maneuvering of these drones suggests a major military
power sophistication that begs the question whether they have been
deployed to test our defense capabilities — or worse — by violent
dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea,”
he said.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft
are not U.S. military drones.</p>
<p>What have officials said about the sightings?</p>
<p>Trump has said he believes the government knows more than it’s
saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he
posted on his social media site.</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday that the drones
should be “shot down, if necessary.”</p>
<p>“We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take
them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or
military bases,” Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.</p>
<p>Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round
Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she
doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public
safety.</p>
<p>“How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it
is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”</p>
<p>Are drones allowed in New Jersey?</p>
<p>The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in
the state, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation
Administration regulations and flight restrictions.</p>
<p>In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an
unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>Operators must be FAA-certified.</p>
<p>Have drones been spotted anywhere else?</p>
<p>Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia
Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.</p>
<p>The object was over the ocean, and they watched as it slowly moved
over an Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The
Virginian-Pilot.</p>
<p>“It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what
he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.</p>
<p>“It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.</p>
<p>The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in
the area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton”
Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under
investigation.</p>
<p>Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana
Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia
Beach, is aware of recent reports of sightings in the area and is
coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its
personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said
Friday by email.</p>
<p>Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, 10 to 15 drones were reported hovering over a home
Thursday night in Harwich on Cape Cod. A resident told police they were
bright and she observed them for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Earlier that evening, an off-duty police officer in the same town
noticed similar activity near a public safety complex, police said. The
information was forwarded to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.</p>
<p>Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force
said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military
bases in England that are used by American forces.</p>

demand ransom from Rhode Islanders after data breach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Rhode Island residents’ personal and bank
information, including Social Security numbers, were likely hacked by an
international cybercriminal group asking for a ransom, state officials
said on Saturday. </p>
<p>In what Rhode Island officials described as extortion, the hackers
threatened to release the stolen information unless they were paid an
undisclosed amount of money. </p>
<p>The breached data affects people who use the state’s government
assistance programs and includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, or SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and healthcare
purchased through the state’s HealthSource RI, Governor Dan McKee
announced on Friday. </p>
<p>Hackers gained access to RIBridges, the state’s online portal for
obtaining social services earlier this month, the governor’s office said
in a statement, but the breach was not confirmed by its vendor,
Deloitte, until Friday. </p>
<p>“Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a
cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable
information from RIBridges,” the governor’s office said in a statement
on Saturday. </p>
<p>A representative from McKee’s office was not immediately available to
Reuters for comment. </p>
<p>Anyone who has applied for or received benefits through those
programs since 2016 could be affected. </p>
<p>The state directed Deloitte to shut down RIBridges to remediate the
threat, and for the time being, anyone applying for new benefits will
have to do so on paper applications until the system is back up. </p>
<p>Households believed to have been affected will receive a letter from
the state notifying them of the problem and explaining steps to be taken
to help protect their data and bank accounts.</p>

encase Iowa, eastern Nebraska in ice; trigger tornado warning in
California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OMAHA, NEBRASKA — A major ice storm created treacherous driving
conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska this weekend and prompted
temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid
off the road. </p>
<p>Many events were canceled across the region when the storm hit Friday
evening, and businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as
officials urged people to stay home if possible. Temperatures rose high
enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places, however. </p>
<p>“Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it
temporary,” said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa. </p>
<p>At least one person died in a crash caused by the icy roads in
eastern Nebraska. The Washington County Sheriff’s office said a
57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway
30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained
minor injuries. </p>
<p>Trees topple</p>
<p>Elsewhere a storm and wind gusts of up to 96 kilometers per hour
prompted the first tornado warning in San Francisco, California, and
caused some damage. Parts of neighboring San Mateo County were also
included in the warning, which went out at 5:51 a.m. to about 1 million
people in the area. It was lifted by 6:15 a.m. </p>
<p>The storm toppled trees onto cars and streets and damaged some roofs
in San Francisco, which has not seen a tornado since 2005, according to
the Weather Service. The damage was being assessed to determine if there
was indeed a tornado. </p>
<p>“This was the first-ever warning for a possible tornado in San
Francisco. I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a
warning in 2005,” said Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the Weather
Service’s Monterey, California. He said he was not there in 2005. </p>
<p>The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take
shelter, but few people have basements in the area. </p>
<p>“The biggest thing that we tell people in the city is to put as many
walls between you and the outside as possible,” meteorologist Dalton
Behringer said. </p>
<p>Snow falls at ski resorts</p>
<p>In upstate New York, people were digging out after heavy snow fell.
More than 84 centimeters was reported near Orchard Park, where residents
are used to dealing with lake-effect snow this time of year. </p>
<p>And in Nevada, up to 91 centimeters of snow was forecast for Sierra
Nevada mountaintops, with a winter storm warning in effect through 10
p.m. More than one-third of a meter fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts,
according to the National Weather Service’s Reno office. </p>
<p>Interstate 80 was closed for about an 130-kilometer stretch from
Applegate, California, to the Nevada state line just west of Reno, where
rain was falling and a winter weather advisory remained in effect
through the afternoon. </p>
<p>In western Washington, tens of thousands of people lost electricity
Saturday, local news outlets reported, amid a system that brought rain
and gusty winds.</p>
