      <h1>Senators claim UnitedHealth is withholding internal documents from inquiry</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>UnitedHealth says it will ‘continue to engage’ with lawmakers who began investigating their involvement in nursing home care after Guardian investigation</p>
<p>UnitedHealth has refused to hand over key internal records to lawmakers investigating the company’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/unitedhealth-nursing-homes">efforts to reduce hospital transfers</a> for nursing home residents, according to a 7 January letter sent to the company by the US senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>The veteran lawmakers, both members of the powerful Senate finance committee, launched their inquiry last summer following a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/unitedhealth-nursing-homes-payments-hospital-transfers">Guardian investigation</a> into bonuses that UnitedHealth pays to nursing homes that reduce hospital transfers for their residents. Those are hospitalizations the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions from the Guardian about the senators’ assertion that the company had failed to turn over internal documents. But it said in a statement that it will “continue to engage” with the senators and that its nursing home care program “improves outcomes” and “reduces unnecessary hospitalizations”.</p>

      <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday the US was 'breaking free from international rules, which it promoted until recently, whether it be trade, certain security matters or some forums'.</p>
<p>His comments came after Donald Trump ordered a military attack on Venezuela in which the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured. The US president has since renewed his call for the US to seize Greenland, a Danish territory – a move that would threaten European security and could mean the end of Nato</p>

Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.</p>
<p>It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla">systematic detention, torture and murder</a>. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Health department’s decision to freeze money for childcare and for families in need could lead to disaster, experts say</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s sudden decision to freeze $10bn worth of federal funding for childcare and needy families has not only already thrown the US childcare system into mass confusion, but could also lead to disaster for hundreds of thousands of families within weeks, experts say.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced late on Tuesday it would block California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York from drawing down money from three major social safety programs over “serious concerns about widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in state-administered programs”. In order to access the funding, the Democratic-run states must provide the Trump administration with extensive documentation to allay the fears of fraud.</p>

      <p>Advocates suing to reverse administration’s surcharge system that has led to passport checks and angry visitors</p>
<p>A new $100 fee for foreign tourists entering US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/national-parks">national parks</a> has triggered chaos and frustrating waits, with staff reporting long entry lines as citizenship checks are made and irate visitors regularly ditching plans to patronize some of America’s most cherished landscapes.</p>
<p>The new fee system, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/national-park-fee-non-residents">introduced</a> by the Trump administration from 1 January, has caught many visitors and National Park Service (NPS) staff off-guard, with checks now having to be undertaken to assess nationality and tourists often turning away from entrances rather than pay the surcharge. The Guardian heard accounts of problems from several NPS staff, speaking anonymously, who work at different parks across the country.</p>

<p>He jumped into his car to head to the scene. Torres DeSantiago manages the Immigrant Defense Network, a group that monitors ICE activity and responds to community needs after someone is taken. He has responded to dozens of scenes in the past few months, and even more in the last few days since the federal government surged its presence in the midwestern city.</p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Given his rise during the ego joyride of the 1980s, it’s no shock that Trump’s foreign policy is to emulate that decade’s belligerent cinema</p>
<p>The box office barnstormer of 2026 arrived early this year. A sleazy banana-republic dictator flooding the American streets with blow. The over-the-border Delta Force extraction squad sent to pluck this schmo out of his impregnable fortress. The bronzed tough-talker who’s firing an RPG up the tailpipe of the international rules-based order – but who gets the job done. Call it: Caracas Thunder.</p>
<p>Sounds like a bit of a throwback, you might be thinking. But, judging by his press conference after the US military’s abduction of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, Donald Trump seemed to have finally achieved his dream of directing his own 80s action movie.</p>

<p>Jordan joined Marketplace Tech host Meghan McCarty Carino to talk about how he found the footage and the dangers the surveillance system poses to privacy and other civil liberties. Remember, Big Brother is always watching.</p>

      <h1>Trump's tariff fight at the Supreme Court could make for a messy refund battle for businesses</h1>

<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue rulings on Friday but, as is customary, has not said what case or cases will be acted upon. If they strike down Trump's tariffs, the U.S. could have to pay back billions — but companies, trade lawyers and customs brokers don't anticipate the government would make it easy to recoup that cash.</p>

<p>The United States could oversee Venezuela and control its oil revenue for years, President Donald Trump said in a newly published interview published. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a vote Thursday that could rebuke Trump, though he is likely to veto the measure if it passes.</p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>The postseason consistently serves up enthralling football. But there are ways to make it even more compelling</p>
<p>No legitimate Super Bowl champion should have a losing record in the regular season. The Panthers, crowned NFC South champions at 8-9, are not an outlier. Since 2010, five teams with losing records have made the postseason. The 2022 Bucs were the first team to make the dance with a losing record since the league instituted a 17-game schedule. This season, the NFC South has done it again.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A federal enforcement operation ended with a woman dead and the facts contested. The NBA cannot treat state violence in a residential neighborhood as background noise</p>
<p>The SUV sat motionless against a tree on a south Minneapolis street, its engine quiet, angled as if it had simply run out of gas. Except the windshield bore a small shattered star, delicate and sharp, like a snowflake pressed into glass. Cold Minnesota air leaked through the fracture, settling over the still body inside. The car became a sealed room, a thin shell holding death in place, surrounded <a href="https://x.com/adamemedia/status/2009038936396509522?s=46">by the stuffed animals</a> of the woman’s children.</p>
<p>In the street, witnesses screamed. Not in words, but in sounds that come before language, as reality breaks faster than thought.</p>

<p>Corey Kispert is also headed from Washington to Atlanta, said the person, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not received the required league approval. The person said the league’s trade call will not take place before Thursday. Typically, teams cannot discuss pending trades until they are approved by the league.</p>

<p><strong>Farage</strong> says he agrees with Starmer that the fate of Greenland must be decided by Greenland and Denmark, not the US – but sided with Trump on “some genuine security concerns” that require further presence there.</p>
<p><em>“What I will say is this. <strong>There are some genuine security concerns around Greenland</strong> and that becomes ever more relevant with a retraction of the ice caps as we head towards the North Pole. There is a strong feeling in British intelligence circles, and many in Nato, that <strong>there needs to be a significant Nato base located directly on the north of Greenland.</strong></em></p>

<p>Live video footage showed scores of Trump supporters smashing windows, beating police officers and scrambling over each other as they broke into the Capitol building, in an attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. “The most shameful day in American history,” Guardian writer Robert Reich called it.</p>

<p>CES 2026 in Las Vegas has been dominated by two things: the next generation of AI compute and a sudden explosion of credible humanoid robots.</p>
<p>While Tesla isn’t officially exhibiting on the floor, Elon Musk has been actively monitoring the event from X. His reactions, and lack thereof, to the major announcements give us a fascinating look into how Tesla views the rapidly crowding field of autonomy.</p>
<p>Musk was quick to comment on NVIDIA’s major push into embedded AI for autonomous systems, but he has been noticeably quiet regarding the masterclass put on by Hyundai and Boston Dynamics.</p>

<p>Thunder Bay has long been known as a hockey hotbed, sending dozens of local players to the National Hockey League, and even a pair of players to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Yet, when it comes to the annual World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Thunder Bay’s representation is comparatively low. This year’s tournament marked the second World Juniors selection for Thunder Bay’s Carter George, whose selection in last year’s event marked the first time a player from the city was selected since Mackenzie Blackwood in 2016.</p>

<p>A new player in the electric transit space, Quebec-based Letenda, is trying to solve a problem that has plagued the transition to electric buses in North America: the “missing middle.” While we have seen plenty of full-size 40-foot electric buses and smaller shuttles, the 30-foot “midibus” market has been largely underserved.</p>
<p>Letenda thinks they have the answer with the “Electrip,” a ground-up design that focuses heavily on winter efficiency and a modular build.</p>

Driven by strong winds through parched vegetation, multiple fires exploded in quick succession last January, and devoured roughly 16,000 structures on all sides of LA.</p>
<p>Thirty-one lives were lost and thousands more were for ever changed. For many, a new chapter of the disaster began to unfold when the flames were extinguished, while the slow road to recovery started to take shape in the year that followed.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In Vallejo, California, ‘trad sons’ report feeling trapped by family obligations, slim job prospects and the fear of violence – leaving little room for romance</p>
<p>Are boys becoming men later? In recent decades, the markers of adulthood have shifted for young American men: they are almost twice as likely to be <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/">single</a>, less likely to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/12/18/fewer-young-men-are-in-college-especially-at-4-year-schools/">go to college</a> and more likely to be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-men-are-more-unemployed-than-women-healthcare-tech-2025-8">unemployed</a>. Most significantly for their parents, they are also less likely to have fled the nest, with the term “ <a href="https://people.com/what-is-a-trad-son-11836688">trad son</a>” springing into social media lexicon in recent months. In the 1970s, only 8% of Americans aged 25 to 34 were living with their parents, but by 2023, that figure had jumped to 18%, with men more likely to live at home than women, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/04/17/the-shares-of-young-adults-living-with-parents-vary-widely-across-the-us/">Pew survey</a>.</p>
<p>But not everywhere in the US has the same rates of adults living in their familial home. The living arrangement is least common in the midwest and most common in the north-east. Topping the list was Vallejo, where 33% of young adults live with their parents. How were they making it work?</p>

      <p>A survey released in the fall finds that most people displaced by the Southern California wildfires a year ago are still living in temporary housing. Since so few homes have been rebuilt, how are people paying for shelter? Today, we'll hear how survivors have organized to demand accountability and the resources needed. Plus, a semiconductor chip shortage echoes the great supply chain crisis of 2020, but this time it's driven by AI.</p>

<p>European leaders have sounded the alarm over Donald Trump’s ambitions to take over Greenland, but the U.S. president may instead be thinking of his legacy. If that’s the case, many analysts, diplomats and politicians believe not only will European diplomacy fail, but the entire post-Second World War system of alliances will come crashing down alongside it, should the U.S. move unilaterally.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> One of Europe's busiest airports has canceled more than 700 flights today as a disruption caused by snow and ice enters a sixth day. The problem was made worse because of a shortage of anti-freeze for de-icing planes at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Dutch airline KLM is the main one affected. Then, China's Foreign Ministry calls President Donald Trump's demands for Venezuelan oil &quot;typical bullying&quot; from the U.S.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military">an effort to acquire Greenland</a>, noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.</p>
<p><strong>How are the US’s European allies responding?</strong> In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.</p>
<p><strong>What would a deal of this kind signify?</strong> Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment">open up</a> to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.</p>

      <p>This summer’s tournament is seen as a culmination, but in truth it’s the next World Cup where the USMNT may have the most success</p>
<p>When the US was confirmed as a future World Cup co-host on the eve of the 2018 tournament in Russia, the USMNT were still stuck under the rubble of their shocking failure to qualify. Mauricio Pochettino was just establishing himself among European club soccer’s managerial elite, taking Tottenham to the Champions League final a year later.</p>
<p>Few could have imagined that he’d be leading the USMNT into the 2026 World Cup, and perhaps fewer believe he’ll stick around for the next cycle. Nevertheless, after a 2-1 win over Australia in Commerce City, Colorado to end the October window, Pochettino noted he’s building a team with 2030 in mind, too.</p>

<p>Pilots can’t see it coming, and it’s hard to avoid. But severe clear-air turbulence can shake a plane ‘like King Kong.’ It’s on the rise, and forecast to get worse due to climate change.

<p>Questioned over the weekend about how the U.S. government will take over governing Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instead shifted the focus to the U.S. blockade of sanctioned oil tankers. CBC News looks at the origins of the blockade, what it entails, whether it's considered legal and just how effective it is.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and his advisers are looking into “a range of options” in an effort to acquire Greenland, noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.</p>
<p>“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>Harbaugh is the most successful coach in the history of the franchise and was the second longest-tenured head coach in the NFL before his dismissal. Ironically, his final game with the Ravens came against the only name ahead of him in terms of tenure length – Mike Tomlin, who has been head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers for 19 seasons.</p>

<p>A new lawsuit has been filed against Tesla following a tragic accident in Idaho that killed four family members, with the plaintiffs blaming the automaker’s Autosteer and driver-assist features for veering the Model X into an oncoming truck.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a wave of lawsuits hitting Tesla after the automaker lost its first major Autopilot trial last year.</p>
<p>Warning: this is a heartbreaking story.</p>

<p>Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine and ranking member of the House appropriations interior, environment, and related agencies subcommittee, said Monday that the controversial measure pushed by the agrochemical giant Bayer and industry allies has been stripped from the 2026 funding bill.</p>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>In an interview with Nick Robinson, the Tory leader made it clear she was thrilled to see the back of international law. May the best country win!</p>
<p>These weren’t exactly the words Kemi Badenoch had been hoping to hear. Halfway through her interview on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, the BBC presenter Nick Robinson observed that, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/maduro-pleads-not-guilty">in regard to the US coup in Venezuela</a>, the Conservative leader’s position wasn’t that far off from Keir Starmer’s. You could sense the air go out of the room. In KemiWorld there is no greater dishonour than a likeness to the prime minister. Time for the fightback to begin. To create some distance.</p>
<p>OK, Kemi said. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/06/stephen-miller-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland">Yes, she too drew the line at Greenland</a>. That would be a step too far. There was no need for Donald Trump to claim the country for America. That was an action that could threaten Nato. And besides, as far as she knew, Greenland wasn’t a rogue narco state. She, too believed in a world of moral relativism. One where it was fine to invade countries whose regimes we disliked. There was one rule for the west and another for the rest.</p>

<p>Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate appropriations committee with jurisdiction over the Pentagon’s budget, said she believed it was wrong to target Kelly’s military benefits because of a political video.</p>

Achieving the president’s dream of supercharging the country’s oil production would be financially challenging – and if fulfilled, would be “terrible for the climate”, experts say.</p>
<p>Trump has aggressively sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/22/trump-big-oil-energy-priorities-explained">boost oil and gas production</a> within the US. Now, after the capture and arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, he is seeking to orchestrate a ramp-up of drilling in Venezuela, which has the largest known reserves of oil in the world – equivalent to about 300bn barrels, <a href="https://knowledge.energyinst.org/search/record?id=58930">according to</a> research firm the Energy Institute.</p>

      <h1>Michigan loophole makes it difficult to track utilities’ donations to politicians</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>Revelation comes as a first-in-the-nation citizen’s ballot initiative to ban donations by utilities picks up steam</p>
<p>An investigation into Michigan election records has found a major loophole in reporting laws that makes it difficult to track when and how campaign contributions move between lawmakers and the state’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/michigan-covid-lockdown-dte-energy">controversial</a> utilities, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy.</p>
<p>State law does not require the date that a contributor makes a donation to match the date that a campaign committee reports receiving it. That has created a scenario in which utilities throughout 2025 have cut checks for lawmakers around the time of controversial votes, but the lawmakers sometimes still have not reported receiving the contribution or report it much later.</p>

<p>E-bike theft is one of those problems that never really goes away. Those of us <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/20/i-just-had-another-expensive-electric-bike-stolen-heres-what-would-have-stopped-it/">who have been victims</a> of it will never really forget that feeling. Of course, good locks can help, and GPS trackers might assist in getting a stolen bike back. But once a bike is stolen, the real incentive for thieves is simple: resale. And that’s exactly the problem Bosch is aiming to tackle with a new software update unveiled at CES 2026.</p>

<p>Nvidia (NVDA) held its CES 2026 keynote today, and as expected, Jensen Huang dropped a massive amount of news on the autonomous driving front. The biggest takeaway? Nvidia is moving beyond just “perceiving” the road to “reasoning” about it with a new family of open-source models called <strong>Alpamayo</strong>, which will power new autonomous and driver-assistance features.</p>
<p>Starting with Mercedes-Benz as soon as this quarter.</p>

<p>Battery electric vehicles accounted for a third of new car sales in December in the UK, right on target to meet or exceed the government’s 33% target for EV adoption in 2026, showing how policy can lead to goals getting met even when industry complains they are impossible.</p>

      <h1>Markets shrug off U.S. capture of Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>Disruptive geopolitical events often push investors to jump into bonds or sell off stocks temporarily. But when the U.S. military captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and President Trump declared control over the oil-rich nation, neither of those happened. In this episode, markets are largely unmoved by Trump’s military intervention. Plus: Experts say jobs data is most important for predicting where the economy is headed, and Landon Derentz at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center gives context to Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.</p>

</ul>
<p>The theory sounds straightforward. Venezuela <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play">has vast oil reserves</a> and used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now. Therefore it should be a simple matter to upgrade the crumbling kit with an injection of dollars and watch the extra barrels and profits flow.</p>
<p>That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.</p>

<p>Five Stanford University students are facing trial beginning on Monday over felony charges stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest on campus – the most severe criminal case brought against some of the thousands of students who staged nationwide protests and encampments against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The northern California students are part of a group of 12 who were charged with felony conspiracy to trespass and felony vandalism in connection to an hour-long, June 2024 occupation during which the group barricaded themselves inside the university president’s office to demand Stanford consider a student resolution to divest from Israel, among other requests.</p>

<p>Clustered along the US Gulf coast are some of the largest and most complex heavy-oil refineries in the world. These sprawling industrial hubs, owned by major US oil companies, stand ready to emerge as some of the major victors of Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/why-trump-us-attacked-caracas-captured-venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro">swoop on Venezuela</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, these refineries are a relic of another time; built to process the heavy, unctuous crude imported from Latin America before the boom in lighter US shale oil emerged earlier this century.</p>

      <p>Investors see some oil companies as big winners with the U.S. forcing a change of leadership in Venezuela. This morning, we'll hear how U.S. oil companies are faring in light of the news. Then, we'll provide some context for oil production and chat about global demand, what it'd take to develop Venezuela's infrastructure to help spark production, and learn how long it would take for U.S. oil companies to be reimbursed for investments.</p>

      <p>António Guterres concerned by ‘possible intensification of instability’ of Venezuela; ousted president arrives at a Manhattan courthouse where the full list of charges will be read</p>
<p>A UK minister would not be drawn into saying whether his government believes the US capture of Venezuela’s president was influenced by <strong>the country’s rich oil reserves</strong>.</p>
<p>Asked on Sky News why he thought Donald Trump had captured <strong>Nicolás Maduro</strong> and said America would “run” Venezuela, Home Office minister <strong>Mike Tapp</strong> said:</p>
<p><em><strong>This is for Donald Trump to answer</strong>, and I think he has said in his press conference, which I watched with interest around narco-terrorism and that threat.</em></p>

<p>If you’ve spent enough time riding electric bikes, you quickly realize that power is only part of the draw. Another big part is sound – or more accurately, the lack of it. A smooth, quiet motor can make an e-bike feel refined and premium, while a buzzy, rattly drivetrain can cheapen the experience no matter how strong the specs look on paper.</p>
<p>That’s something Bafang, one of the world’s largest e-bike motor manufacturers, says it has been focusing on for years. And after <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/i-went-back-to-bafangs-factory-in-china-five-years-later-the-difference-is-mindblowing/">I took a trip inside their motor testing grounds</a>, I got to see how they do it.</p>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The head coach (or should that be manager?) fired cryptic shots at his Old Trafford bosses, then was fired himself</p>

</ul>
<p>Discontent at Manchester United these days is only ever deferred. Ruben Amorim’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/05/ruben-amorim-sacked-by-manchester-united-transfers-power-struggle">departure from the club</a> on Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh. He had made a half-hearted protest about the recruitment structure after Sunday’s draw at Leeds, but it felt even at the time like barely more than a gesture. And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.</p>
<p>Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.</p>

<p>When Lani Ritter Hall’s beloved husband of more than 40 years, Gus, died in 2022, she felt a bit unmoored. Taking care of him had been the thing that got her out of bed in the morning, and with him gone, the 76-year-old felt she’d lost her purpose.</p>

      <p>Pacific Grove is known as ‘Butterfly Town USA’ for its role as an overwintering spot. As the insect’s population plummets, residents are coming to its rescue</p>
<p>In the tiny seaside village of Pacific Grove, California, there’s no escaping the monarch butterfly.</p>
<p>Here, butterfly murals abound: one splashes across the side of a hotel, another adorns a school. As for local businesses, there’s the Monarch Pub, the Butterfly Grove Inn, even Monarch Knitting (a local yarn shop). And every fall, the small city hosts a butterfly parade, where local elementary school children dress up in butterfly costumes. The city’s municipal code even declares it an unlawful act to “molest or interfere” with monarchs in any way, with a possible fine of $1,000.</p>

<p>When Americans go to cast ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, much of the attention is likely to be on races for the US House, Senate and governorships – contests that will serve as a referendum on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s first two years in office and determine the trajectories of the final ones.</p>
<p>But further down the ballot, voters will choose secretaries of state in key races that could have a major effect on how elections are run in many US states, including several battleground states that are key to the 2028 presidential race. Twenty-six states are set to choose secretaries of state next year, including the presidential battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona and Michigan.</p>

      <p>US officials have warned of further military intervention if Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, fails to meet their demands. Plus, how gun-safety advocates are riding a ‘seismic’ wave to US legislatures</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Nicolás Maduro, the deposed Venezuelan president, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-new-york-court">expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon</a> on drugs and weapons charges after US special forces seized him in a shocking raid at the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>What is the reaction in Caracas?</strong> While some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/few-in-caracas-are-celebrating-as-they-face-an-uncertain-post-maduro-future">quietly rejoiced at Maduro’s demise</a>, the traumatic night-time assault on the city prompted stockpiling, uncertainty and fear.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the global impact of Trump’s slashing of climate science?</strong> It’s substantial. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites and studies to track extreme weather in Europe, plan disaster responses in the Caribbean and monitor deforestation in the Amazon.</p>

<p>Donald Trump and his defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> are mounting an aggressive push to politicise the top ranks of the US military – a push that smacks of Stalinism and could take years to repair, the former infantry chief who trained troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/iraq-war-invasion-2003-aftermath-middle-east-islamic-state">invade Iraq</a> has warned.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Paul Eaton has sounded the alarm, saying in an interview with the Guardian that the effort to bend the higher echelons of the military to the US president’s will was unparalleled in recent history and could have long-term dire consequences. He warned that both the reputation and efficiency of the world’s most powerful fighting force was in the balance.</p>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The 2024 presidential race was the first big election to happen in the new generative AI era. There have, of course, been major concerns that the technology could be used to deceive voters or interfere with the exercise of democracy. But so far, that kind of activity has been limited, according to Tim Harper, a senior policy analyst and coauthor of a recent report from the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>

      <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defends capture of Nicolás Maduro and says US has ‘leverage’ over country</p>
<p>Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and prominent Republicans swiftly backpedaled from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry">assertion</a> that the US will run <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> in transition after US forces snatched the president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to the US to face federal criminal charges.</p>
<p>Rubio appeared on numerous US politics shows on Sunday morning to defend the US operation in the early hours of Saturday to capture Maduro and his wife despite critics calling the operation illegal on multiple levels and the White House failing to demonstrate how it would run the South American nation.</p>

      <p>From Los Angeles to Nevada, younger people are preserving a longstanding tradition one lyric at a time</p>
<p>Deep in the heart of Los Angeles’s Koreatown, just a few doors down from H Mart and a K-pop music superstore, an American flag hangs over the entrance of a saloon called Eastwood.</p>
<p>The western-themed bar would normally be cranking Luke Bryan while customers play skee-ball, line dance and get bucked off their mechanical bull named Gucci. But tonight, the music is low and the loudest sounds come from the clacking of vintage mechanical typewriters. About 30 people in the bar are drafting poems about horses, sunsets and Stetson hats – which are plentiful atop the heads in the crowd.</p>
<p><em>Heck, they thought they killed me back in</em> <em>15</em></p>

<p>“No governor should have the power to unilaterally declare a civil rights or advocacy group he disagrees with a terrorist organization, take punitive action against them, all in violation of due process and free speech,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Guardian this month. “If any governor can get away with abusing that kind of power, then no organization is safe.”</p>

<p>Jackery has just pulled the wraps off its newest portable power station, the Explorer 1500 Ultra, and it’s aiming squarely at people who actually use these things outside – not just those who keep them pristine in a garage for the occasional blackout. Unveiled this week at CES 2026, the new unit is designed to be tougher, lighter, and more weather-resistant than most power stations in its class, with specs showing how Jackery is leaning hard into real-world use cases.</p>
<p>Beyond just portable power, the company is also showcasing innovative new products that target much bigger ambitions – literally. With a new solar gazebo and a self-following robot, the Jackery is dramatically expanding the scope of its solar and portable power initiatives.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan oil industry has been “a total bust” for a long time, according to Donald Trump.

      <h1>Venezuela attack: what we know so far as US captures President Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York</p>
<p>The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:</p>
<p>Donald Trump said <strong>“We’re going to run the country</strong>[Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.</p>
<p><strong>A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening</strong> and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation</strong> <strong>, Trump</strong> <strong>said.</strong> He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.</strong> It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>UN security council</strong> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0">due to hold</a> an emergency meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump said his administration <strong>had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong>. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”</p>
<p>The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered <strong>vice president Delcy Rodríguez</strong> to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.</p>
<p><strong>Trump was asked about Cuba</strong> during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Justice released a new indictment</strong> against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.</p>
<p><strong>The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”</strong> <strong>.</strong> Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398">wrote</a>: “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro</strong> <strong>was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.</strong> The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.</p>
<p>The <strong>UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela</strong>, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.</p>

      <p>Most of the Americas have suffered from interference from their powerful northern neighbour – and are usually the worse off for it</p>

</ul>
<p>The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, follow a long history of interventions in South and Central America and the Caribbean over the past two centuries. But they also mark an unprecedented moment as the first direct US military attack on a South American country.</p>
<p>At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.</p>

<p>Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.</p>
<p>Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.</p>

<p>Reaction to the capture of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> in Caracas, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a>, by US forces on Saturday has been starkly polarized along political lines, with administration officials and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> celebrating the enforcement of a 2020 US narco-trafficking indictment against Maduro and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> decrying what they see as a violation of Venezuela’s right to self-determination.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007428087143686611">The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on X</a> that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the southern district of New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States.</p>

<p>As they were jolted from their beds just before 2am on Saturday, many Caracas residents sought an innocent explanation for the racket that had interrupted their sleep: an exploding air conditioning unit, a tropical thunderstorm, an earthquake. Or perhaps a festive display of pyrotechnics over Venezuela’s mountain-flanked capital.</p>
<p>“I thought it might be fireworks,” Carlos Hurtado, a resident of the 23 de Enero housing estate on the city’s west side, recalled of the moment he was woken by a mysterious sequence of rumblings and explosions.</p>

<p>Overnight on Friday, the US carried out airstrikes across Venezuela, with explosions rocking the capital, Caracas, before dawn. Shortly afterwards, Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them out of the country.</p>
<p>The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said they would face trial in New York on charges of involvement in narco-terrorism. A fresh indictment was issued on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The Sisters of Watts have served families for a decade, providing food, fitness, money and after-school programs</p>
<p>The weekend before Thanksgiving, the gymnasium in Ted Watkins park in the south Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts was crowded with more than 100 families. For three hours, they ate and talked while their kids ran around and a DJ blasted west coast hip-hop staples during games of limbo and musical chairs.</p>
<p>Toward the back of the room, people clamored around a step-and-repeat to get a picture with the event’s organizers: four siblings known as the Sisters of Watts, who for the past decade have arranged food giveaways, backpack drives and after-school activities for kids growing up on the same blocks they did. At this event, there were bags of fresh produce available for families that wanted them.</p>

(date: 2026-01-03)
      <p>
      <p>New documents reveal numerous missed opportunities as experts and victims condemn US authorities’ failures</p>
<p>Over the course of two decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women. And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.</p>
<p>The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct. The issue has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, often focusing on the idea that Epstein – who lived at the center of a network of powerful people – enjoyed some form of protection.</p>

<p>Nikki Massie never had a reason to question her salary. After more than a decade with the same company, she’d earned awards, promotions and the trust of co-workers who felt like family. But then one day, she discovered she might have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars over the years. Nikki began to wonder: What do you do when you suspect you’ve been underpaid? And at what point do you consider walking away?</p>

<p>A federal magistrate judge has ruled that the man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican headquarters the night before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach">January 6 Capitol attack</a> must remain in custody while awaiting trial.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.287327/gov.uscourts.dcd.287327.28.0.pdf">memorandum opinion</a>, the court determined that Brian Cole Jr, 30, of Woodbridge, Virginia, “poses an intolerable risk of danger to the community if released”, granting the government’s motion for pretrial detention.</p>

      <p>Hiroshi Nagai, in a post on X, has objected to his artwork being used by the agency to promote its deportation agenda</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is facing backlash once again, this time from a Japanese artist who has condemned the agency for using, without permission, his work to promote deportations.</p>
<p>In a post on X on New Year’s Eve, the department posted a photo featuring a pristine and empty beach with palm trees and a vintage car. Written across the photo was “America after 100 million deportations,” along with a separate caption that said: “The peace of a nation no longer besieged by the third world.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>A shift away from police-led responses spreads, but gaps in crisis teams leave some communities exposed</p>
<p>In the past year, a handful of sheriff’s departments in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> have <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/04/mental-health-crisis-california-police-response/">started refusing to respond</a> to 911 calls that involve a mental health crisis, but where no crime has been reported.</p>
<p>In February, the Sacramento sheriff, Jim Cooper, announced that his deputies would only respond to mental health crises if a crime had been committed or was in process, or if someone other than the person in crisis was in imminent danger. Down in San Diego county, the police chief for the city of El Cajon, Jeremiah Larson, made a similar policy decision in May.</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Greg Abel has officially taken the reins at Berkshire Hathaway, stepping into the role long held by the titan of value investing, Warren Buffett.

And do professional movie critics still matter in an age of Reddit threads and Letterboxd reviews?</p>

      <p>
      <p>A once-toxic topic is helping survivors and relatives of victims get elected to enact the laws they helped draft</p>
<p>A new generation of young political leaders is gaining power in the US by using their personal experience with gun violence to push for reforms they say the US is ready for.</p>
<p>Their ascent is part of a nearly decade-long shift, from gun violence prevention being a third-rail issue in politics that was rarely spoken about on campaign trails, to one that candidates, most of them Democrats, are now running – and winning – on.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable. Here are major trends that emerged last year</p>
<p>As the Trump administration boosts fossil fuels, Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable for alleged climate deception. That wave of litigation swelled in 2025, with groundbreaking cases filed and wins notched.</p>
<p>But the year also brought setbacks, as Trump attacked the cases and big oil worked to have them thrown out. The industry also worked to secure a shield from current and future climate lawsuits.</p>

      <h1>Amid wide healthcare cuts, a bright spot for rural hospitals</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Healthcare costs are climbing for many Americans as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits roll back, raising premiums for middle-income households unless Congress intervenes. In this vacuum, we look at a major new federal investment aimed at expanding healthcare access in rural communities. Plus, U.S. travel is sending mixed signals this year — domestic travel is booming, but fewer international visitors are visiting the States, and that shift is being felt by America’s museums.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Swiss investigators are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire">racing to identify the victims of a fire</a> that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fire start?</strong> The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to identify the dead?</strong> Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he say?</strong> Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”</p>

      <h1>USMNT’s World Cup, Arsenal’s title challenge and Real’s power struggle: soccer questions for 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>The world of soccer throws up no shortage of questions every year. In today’s Pitch Points column, we address three of the big ones for 2026</p>
<p>You may have heard there’s a World Cup this year. After all the debate about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/18/analysis-how-prices-for-the-cheapest-world-cup-tickets-have-rocketed">ticket prices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/trump-peace-prize-fifa-world-cup">peace prizes</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/08/fifa-world-cup-2026-cooling-breaks">cooling breaks</a>, an actual soccer tournament will kick off. That’s when the US, both as a national team and a host nation, will truly be judged; when the 2026 World Cup will be deemed a soaring success or a grotesque failure. There will be no in between. No nuance. That vanished from public discourse a long time ago.</p>

      <h1>‘No one can know’: Heated Rivalry’s gay love story exposes ice hockey’s culture of silence</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>The surprise hit series has reopened a familiar debate: why, in the National Hockey League, visibility is still treated as a problem rather than a possibility</p>
<p>At around the midpoint of the first episode of Heated Rivalry, just after Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov – one Canadian, the other Russian, both hockey’s top prospects – have had their first tryst, Hollander sits at the side of his hotel bed and says: “So. You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?” Rozanov, lying naked beside him, replies sarcastically: “Me? Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”</p>
<p>No one can know. If hockey were to have an unofficial slogan, this might be it. Heated Rivalry, the surprise 2025 hit series from Crave and HBO, is layered drama, prompting timely questions about the barriers to acceptance that persist within sport even as they are lowered elsewhere across society. But it may be that hockey’s existential battle with its culture of silence is the show’s deepest target.</p>

<p><em>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/guardian-footballer-of-the-year">Guardian Footballer of the Year</a> is an award given to a player who has done something remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty.</em></p>
<p>Jess Carter has spent her life grappling with when to hold back and when to speak up; wrestling with being naturally herself, embodying the characteristics her parents instilled in her of being open, honest, vocal and confident, and subduing herself because, while society values those traits, in a black woman they can be viewed negatively.</p>

      <p>Toby Morton now owns trumpkennedycenter.org, which advertises new year performance by the ‘Epstein dancers’</p>
<p>Donald Trump may be remaking the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts into a pool of his self-reflection, but a writer for South Park, the TV series that better reflects the obsessions and tendencies of the administration than any political pundit, has purchased the rights to <a href="https://www.trumpkennedycenter.org/" title="">trumpkennedycenter.org</a>.</p>
<p>Toby Morton, a TV writer and producer who has worked on the long-running and joyfully offensive sitcom, said he purchased the domain in August after predicting the president would change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center after he installed himself as chair and stocked the board with loyalists.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The winter holiday season is a key time for nonprofit fundraising — an estimated 30% of annual giving happens in December. But in 2025, highly publicized federal cuts resulted in an individual giving boost throughout the year. In this episode, some nonprofits worry demand will soon outgrow those private donations. Plus: Latino immigrants say deportation fears are reminiscent of the Covid-19 lockdown, communities fight to buy back private utilities, and “This Is Uncomfortable” host Reema Khrais gives tips for sticking to financial New Year’s resolutions.</p>

      <p><em>Hey smarties! Happy New Year. We’re taking a short break for the holidays. In the meantime, we’re sharing an episode from our friends over at “This Is Uncomfortable.” Reema Khrais and the team are getting ready to relaunch the show on Jan. 15. Stay tuned for new episodes!</em></p>
<p>When newlyweds Chantal and Travis Lisback started searching for their dream home in Seattle, they weren’t entirely on the same page. Chantal was eager to settle down as soon as possible, while Travis was more comfortable waiting a few years. As the search dragged on, what began as a shared dream started to feel more like a standoff.</p>
<p>This week, a story about how a big life decision can bring to light the money and communication issues you didn’t know were there. Plus, later in the episode, Chantal and Travis sit down with financial therapist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ajaetherapy/">Aja Evans</a> to unpack what’s happening beneath the surface, and how to approach money fights with more care and intention.</p>

<p>One of the biggest unanswered questions for many folks considering an e-bike isn’t how a bike rides on day one, but rather how it holds up after years of daily use. Reviews and first impressions are everywhere, but genuine long-term ownership stories are surprisingly rare. That’s why a recent shared case from a rider who just crossed 10,000 miles (16,000 km) on their e-bike caught my attention.</p>

      <p>Abortion was seen as one of Democrats’ strongest issues in the 2024 election – new polls indicate that may be shifting</p>
<p>Up to seven states will vote on abortion rights this year. But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count onthe issue in their efforts todrive votes in the 2026 midterms, after makingabortion rightsthe centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followedthe fall of Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/09/poll-abortion-voters-motivations-priorities/">PRRI’s findings mirror a September poll</a> from the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.</p>

      <p>Sheldon Whitehouse, an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center board, remains undeterred and determined to press on with his investigation</p>
<p>“That’s the tactic they use,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator, pondering whether Donald Trump might attach his name to the <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/">John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>. “You float stuff and you float stuff and you float stuff until people get inured to what a stupid or outrageous thing it is that has been floated and then you pull the trigger.”</p>
<p>Whitehouse was sitting in his Senate office and speaking to the Guardian at 11am on Thursday 18 December. Two hours later, his words proved prophetic. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/2001717032191168839?s=20">announced on X</a> that the Kennedy Center board had “voted unanimously” to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center.</p>

      <p>President auctioned off portrait painted live onstage and said his new year’s resolution was ‘peace on Earth’</p>
<p>Donald Trump welcomed 2026 with a glitzy bash at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach where he auctioned off a freshly painted portrait of Jesus Christ for $2.75m and said his new year’s resolution was a wish for “peace on Earth”.</p>
<p>The portrait of Jesus had been painted on stage by artist Vanessa Horabuena, who, <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/politics/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-charity-auction/2025/12/31/id/1240393/">the president said</a>, was “one of the greatest artists anywhere in the world”.</p>

      <h1>US federal employees file complaint against ban on gender-affirming care</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Complaint argues Trump administration denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination</p>
<p>The Trump administration is facing a legal complaint from a group of government employees affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Gas prices hit their lowest level for a December since 2020, according to AAA, thanks largely to a global oil glut that pushed crude prices down about 20% last year. We look at whether cheaper fuel is likely to stick around in 2025. Plus, a new business in New York City doubles as a museum celebrating the history and cultural impact of the photo booth. And we examine how the expiration of federal tax credits is reshaping the electric vehicle market after a rocky year.</p>

      <p>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the democratic socialist who is now mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos">viral memes</a> and its candidate’s witty quips.</p>
<p>Here are some of the quotes that came to define his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats">historic</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral">push</a> to lead one of the world’s most important cities:</p>
<p>New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.</p>
<p>What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.</p>
<p>No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.</p>
<p>It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.</p>
<p>I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.</p>
<p>I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.</p>
<p>I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.</p>
<p>If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!</p>

      <h1>From Sehitler to Armstrong: 10 female footballers set for breakthrough in 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Today’s newsletter looks at 10 superlative talents who are ready to take the next step in the coming 12 months</p>
<p><strong>Alara Sehitler</strong> <strong>, Bayern Munich and Germany (19):</strong> Sehitler’s transition into Bayern Munich’s first team has come as little surprise and the creative midfielder has established herself as a strong impact player for José Barcala’s side. She has three Frauen Bundesliga goals this season and sparked Bayern’s comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League. After making her senior debut for Germany in November 2024, she will be looking to establish herself as a regular for their upcoming 2027 World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Giulia Galli</strong> <strong>, Roma and Italy (17):</strong> Galli is widely regarded as one of the best young Italian talents to emerge for a long time and became Roma’s youngest player to make her Serie A debut in May 2024, aged 16 and one month. Establishing herself in the senior squad this season, she scored her first club goal in September and has featured in the Champions League. After starring in Italy’s sensational run to the semi-finals of last summer’s Under-17 Euros, the talented forward played a significant role at the subsequent Under-17 World Cup, picking up the bronze boot. She will surely feature at this autumn’s Under-20 World Cup.</p>

      <p>From freezing rents to free buses and municipal grocery stores – a recap of the policies that won Mamdani the office</p>
<p>Zohran Mamdani was sworn into office as New York’s 111th mayor at the stroke of midnight, the first Muslim mayor as well as the first to take office as a Democrat bearing the credentials of a democratic socialist.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old was sworn in by Letitia James, the state attorney general, in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train, to be followed by a first-of-its-kind public block party along Broadway’s “Canyon of Heroes”.</p>

      <h1>How to talk dating like gen Z: 51 (hyperspecific) terms for love, sex and bad behavior</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>As young people take on a messy dating landscape, they’ve created their own lexicon to match. Here’s like what phrases ‘bird theory’ and ‘monkey branching’ mean</p>
<p>This year marked a decade since the term “ghosting” hit the mainstream. At the time, the idea that someone could abruptly cease communication with a lover without explanation seemed like the peak of indignity. How naive we were. In the 10 years since, finding a partner has only become more confounding – an oftentimes fruitless exercise in humiliation that is increasingly pigeonholed by social media jargon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">Gen Z</a>, a cohort who came of age during a loneliness epidemic, a masculinity crisis, and a coordinated attack on the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, faces a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2025/nov/28/gen-z-sex-dating-relationships">far messier landscape</a> than their millennial predecessors could ever imagine. And so their dating glossary has grown longer and more deranged, with phrases like “Shrekking” and “monkey branching” testing the limits of your sanity.</p>
<p><strong>Red flags</strong> – Behavioral quirks indicating a potential partner is bad news. Examples include calling their exes crazy, subpar tipping habits, a love of Woody Allen films, a burgeoning DJ career …</p>
<p><strong>Green flags</strong> – These quirks validate your decision to pursue a mate. Examples include checking in to make sure you got home safe after a date, low screen time, owning a bed frame …</p>
<p><strong>Beige flags</strong> – These usually describe niche, mostly benign quirks. Examples include being an enthusiastic birdwatcher, still carrying around a pen in their purse, paying rent in cash …</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>When it comes to homebuilding, Ronda Conger, vice president of CBH Homes, wants to be like the Savannah Bananas.</p>
<p>“We are out there trying to do things so differently,” she said. “It’s one of the reasons we embraced AI so quickly.”</p>
<p>But there are growing fears that artificial intelligence will begin to replace human employees. For Conger’s team, the bots are doing the grunt work, so the real humans can shine.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The continent’s problems are not caused by immigration or cultural politics but by economic and technological decline</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">national security strategy</a> offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.</p>
<p>That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the <a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/">US</a> is slightly higher than <a href="https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/">in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>The report came a day after Jim O’Neill, the HHS deputy secretary, and Alex Adams, an HHS assistant secretary who oversees the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), <a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2006136004294664464">appeared in a Tuesday evening video message</a>. O’Neill declared that the department had “activated our defend-the-spend system for all ACF childcare payments across America” and would now require “justification, receipt or photo evidence before we make a payment”.</p>

      <p>Black and brown former employees from CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue talk about the effects of being let go</p>
<p>Trey Sherman was traveling to work on the New York subway when he received an email from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/07/bari-weiss-cbs-news-remake/">David Reiter</a>, a CBS News executive, about an imminent meeting on 29 October. Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html">more than 2,000 jobs</a> as part of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.</p>

      <h1>Mystery meat and maggot-infested produce: the disturbing reality of US prison food</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>In Eating Behind Bars, author Leslie Soble details how food is used to further punish incarcerated people in the US</p>
<p>At best you get “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/irish-tourist-ice-detention">mystery meat</a>”. Or “sour-smelling heaps” of <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/food/feeding-the-prison-system-some-inmates-buy-way-around-institutional-cooking/article_34755b6a-ab43-11e6-9077-5b2ef518ef63.html">macaroni</a>. In the worst cases, it’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/san-quentin-on-lockdown-as-inmates-suffer-gastrointestinal-illness-2024-7">undercooked</a> chicken, <a href="https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/report-montana-state-prison-inmates-served-spoiled-milk">spoiled milk</a> and maggot-infested <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/02/aramark-michigan-prison-contractor-maggots-kitchen/28378435/">produce</a>.</p>
<p>In prisons and jails across the US, people are routinely fed unhealthy, tasteless or inedible meals. Many are left hungry and malnourished, with devastating long-term health consequences. The hidden crisis affecting millions of incarcerated people is the subject of <a href="https://thenewpress.org/books/eating-behind-bars/?v=eb65bcceaa5f">Eating Behind Bars</a>, a new book offering a disturbing account of how correctional institutions punish their residents through the food they provide and withhold.</p>

      <p>Costs, insurance delays and difficult-to-obtain mental health treatment plague the US health system</p>
<p>A record 23 % of Americans believe the United States <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> system is “in a state of crisis” and 47% think it has “major problems,” according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/699770/cost-leads-americans-top-mind-healthcare-concerns.aspx">a recent</a> poll from the West Health-Gallup Center on Healthcare in America.</p>
<p>The poll also revealed that a record 29% of Americans see “cost” as the most urgent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">health</a> problem facing the US. Experts note that these two perceptions – that the healthcare system is in a state of crisis and that costs are an urgent health problem – are related.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Enhanced subsidies for health insurance policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are set to expire at the end of today. That means skyrocketing premiums for some Obamacare enrollees. Premiums are expected to more than double, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, and some healthier people are expected to drop their insurance. Plus, 2025 was the year that generative AI exploded, divided, and created trust issues. We'll take a look back.</p>

<p>Campfires that once defined summer trips were never lit due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires">wildfire</a> risks. There were no bites where fish were once abundant, forests turned to meadows after a big burn and childhood memories of winter wonderlands turned to slush.</p>

      <p>People who are in default on their federal student loans could start seeing their wages garnished in the new year. Next week, the Department of Education plans to start sending out letters to borrowers who have missed at least nine months of payments, letting them know the government will begin taking 15% from their paychecks. Also, the U.S. Mint pressed the final batch of pennies last month. We examine the penny's 232-year run.</p>

Those incentives had been on the books in some form since 2008 and were expanded during the Biden administration. They expired at the end of September.</p>
<p>Consumers rushed to take advantage before they disappeared, leading to <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/">record high sales</a> earlier this year. But now the market faces an uncertain road ahead.</p>
<p>Marketplace's Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with her colleague Henry Epp about the outlook for EV sales in the U.S. now that federal tax credits are gone.</p>

      <h1>Life after LeBron James: who will inherit the NBA’s future?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>As the millennial superstars near the end, an international generation reshapes the league. The question is whether an American can still carry the crown</p>
<p>That the NBA is reckoned in seasons is apt. To measure a legacy this way is as much existential as it is symbolic. Martin Heidegger argued that time is not something we pass through, but the condition of our being – less a pathway than a pressure. Heavy stuff, yes, but the NBA has always operated under similar weight.</p>
<p>The millennial superstars who stabilized the league for two decades are now entering their twilight: LeBron James (who turned 41 on Tuesday), Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul. In their wake comes something genuinely new. For the first time, the league’s next dominant generation is unmistakably international. The NBA’s gen Z elite now emerge from Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Canada and France.</p>

<p>Duelling citizen-led petitions related to separation, multiple uses of the notwithstanding clause, a slew of recall petitions, progress on a pipeline deal and municipal elections across the province — 2025 was rife with political news.

As a result, angry Canadians have united behind a &quot;Buy Canadian&quot; movement that experts say is elevating our own whiskies.</p>

<p>Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, said in <a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2006136004294664464">a video statement</a> that the funding freeze was in response to what he called “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country … We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Nearly a year after a New Year's Day truck attack on Bourbon Street left 14 dead, New Orleans officials are still seeking permanent security solutions. Ahead of the anniversary of the rampage, officials are ramping up security measures. Some 350 National Guard members arrived Tuesday. The attack happened when a man plowed a truck into revelers before police shot and killed him. The rampage revealed security vulnerabilities surrounding a famous street that is densely populated by bars and pedestrians. A police captain has urged the city to install permanent security gates to prevent future attacks.</p>

<p>The snowpack survey recorded a snow depth of 24in (61cm), said Angelique Fabbiani-Leon, state hydrometeorologist at the California department of water resources’ snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit. The survey was conducted at the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state.</p>

      <h1>Good news for prospective homebuyers</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Home price growth is cooling, new reports show. Though homeowners may be struggling to sell at asking price, it is good news for prospective buyers. Especially those who’ve been waiting on the sidelines for a good deal. But, as with most housing issues, the slowdown is regional. Also in this episode: Auto sales were strong in 2025, Gen Zers see cash in a new light, and an unlikely government funds a U.S.-based GED program for Mexican immigrants.</p>

<p>Another year has passed, and with it, another collection of Elon Musk’s ambitious timelines that didn’t quite align with reality. For those of us who have been following Tesla for years, this pattern is all too familiar. 2025 was billed as a year of massive expansion, widespread autonomy, and humanoid robots.</p>
<p>Now that the year is pretty much in the rearview mirror, let’s take a look at Musk’s top 5 Tesla predictions that missed the mark.</p>

As GenX becomes the largest and richest new car-buying demographic, manufacturers need to find out what they are nostalgic about.</p>
<p>To that end, I propose the following nostalgia play: <strong>the “Goonies Never Say Die” edition 2027 Dodge Caravan BEV</strong>.</p>

      <p>Lawyers for Brian Cole argue he should be released ahead of trial for allegedly planting devices in DC in 2021</p>
<p>The man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the headquarters of both the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> national committees the night before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach">January 6 insurrection</a> at the US Capitol appeared at a federal detention hearing before a magistrate judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, authorities arrested Brian Cole Jr of Woodbridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a>. He has yet to enter a plea. Cole’s lawyers argued that he should be released while he awaits trial, as he does not present any danger. They also noted that Cole had agreed to home detention enforced by GPS monitoring, and would live under the supervision of a relative. The defense rebuked federal prosecutors who pushed for the suspect to remain in custody.</p>

      <p>Mamdani to take oath of office on New Year’s Eve in gilded age subway station beneath city hall</p>
<p>While tens of thousands of New Yorkers will be in Times Square for the countdown to 2026, the city’s mayor-elect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, has said he will be sworn into office in an underground midnight private ceremony at an abandoned subway station built during the gilded age.</p>
<p>Mamdani, 34, plans to take the oath of office on New Year’s Eve in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train. The unusual choice of venue for the ceremony, Mamdani said, is symbolically resonant of the “inauguration of a new era”.</p>

<p>The storm hit parts of the Plains and Great Lakes on Monday with sharply colder air, strong winds and a mix of snow, ice and rain, leading to treacherous travel. Forecasters said it intensified quickly enough to meet the criteria of a bomb cyclone, a system that strengthens rapidly as pressure drops.</p>

      <h1>A housing roundup and lookahead</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>This morning, we're recapping the 2025 housing market, which was — in a word — sluggish. Even though mortgage rates have come down, affordability remains an issue, and many would-be sellers are locked into ultra-low rates. But economists and real estate agents expect some modest pickup in the year ahead. Then, there's renewed focus on the vulnerability of the global auto supply chain after hackers targeted Jaguar Land Rover in September.</p>

      <h1>Frustrations over state of Iran’s economy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Annual inflation in Iran is running at more than 40%, and business owners are angry at the rapid devaluation of the nation's currency, in part due to the pressure of Western sanctions. In response, shopkeepers in the capital, Tehran, have been demonstrating for a third successive day. Plus, this year's hack at British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover showed just how vulnerable the global auto supply chain could be.</p>

<p>The Chinese-born and Toronto-bred actor says Hollywood has backtracked on the diversity improvements it had made in recent years, and is once again treating Asian-led projects as a gamble — despite numerous box office hits with Asian leads proving otherwise.

      <h1>Online school and junior tennis: freedom, focus – and a quiet cost</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Elite junior tennis players are flocking to online schools. The model offers flexibility and focus – but raises deeper questions about growth, pressure and childhood</p>
<p>In a major study <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html">released recently in Epidemiology</a>, conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.</p>
<p>Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building. I often find myself bonding with the few other parents whose kids remain in regular school as we’re a rapidly dwindling species.</p>

      <h1>‘Be fearful when others are greedy’: Warren Buffett’s sharpest lessons in investing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals</p>
<p>Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway">who is retiring at the end of 2025</a>, has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.</p>
<p>Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with <span class="math inline">\(25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than \)</span>1tn.</p>
<p>Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.</p>
<p>My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).</p>
<p>Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’</p>
<p>When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.</p>
<p>Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)</p>
<p>In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.</p>
<p>Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.</p>
<p>From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.</p>
<p>When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend <em>my</em> 100th.</p>
<p>She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)</p>
<p>The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.</p>
<p>(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)</p>

      <p>The housing market is showing modest improvement, with pending home sales rising over 3% in November and prices growing just 1.2% year over year. Rising inventory and falling mortgage rates mean affordability is improving, though rates likely need to dip below 6% for demand to really pick up.

      <h1>Trump says ‘there’ll be hell to pay’ if Hamas does not disarm as he meets Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>This live blog is now closed.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> is expected to tell <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on Monday that <strong>Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented</strong>, Israeli officials and analysts say.</p>
<p>The trip comes amid a <strong>new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel</strong> to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, which began in October after two years of devastating war.</p>
<p>He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.</p>
<p>Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the [Trump] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.</p>

<p>Two men who died after their helicopters collided midair in New Jersey over the weekend both earned their private pilot licenses over a decade ago and would often have breakfast together at a cafe near the crash site before taking to the skies from the local airport.</p>
<p>Authorities on Monday identified the two New Jersey men as Kenneth Kirsch, 65, and Michael Greenberg, 71. Witnesses told police that the two helicopters they were piloting Sunday were flying close together just before they crashed in a farm field near the airport in Hammonton, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia.</p>

      <p>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official</p>
<p>The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.</p>

<p>We talk a lot here at <em>Electrek</em> about the exponential growth of electric vehicles and the massive strain that puts on the battery supply chain. Literally, the majority of that demand and production comes from China.</p>
<p>But there is a massive difference between <em>processing</em> materials and actually having them in the ground.</p>
<p>A new image from a gigantic materials mining and recycling company in China, gives us a sobering look at the reality of their domestic reserves. The data suggests that China’s own supply of the most critical battery metals isn’t just running low; in some cases, it’s already gone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> firefighters have found the body of a California triathlete on a beach north-west of Santa Cruz, almost a week after she went missing amid speculation that she was killed by a shark.</p>
<p>The remains of Erica Fox were found on Saturday, her father and husband <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/body-found-california-coast-triathlete-went-missing-shark-sighting-rcna251171">confirmed</a> to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/28/lovers-point-shark-attack-victim-identified-by-watch-shark-band-on-ankle/?clearUserState=true">local news</a> outlets. Fox, 55, was part of a group of more than a dozen swimmers who left from Lovers Point near Monterey, California, on 21 December, but she never returned to shore. A witness driving by the area reported to authorities that they saw a shark with what appeared to be a human body in its mouth emerge from the water, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/swimmer-missing-pacific-grove-identified-21259455.php">according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Toxic chemicals like lead and asbestos are likely in dirt used to backfill demolished structures in city, experts say</p>
<p>Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites were <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2025/12/22/toxic-dirt-detroitland-bank-cleanup/87881313007/">potentially backfilled</a> with toxic construction debris from a demolished shopping mall and other sources, creating an unfolding public health threat in the city’s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Detroit, the nation’s lowest income big city, is in the US industrial heartland. It was left with tens of thousands of empty structures as industrial plants closed and people left the city in past decades – Detroit’s population dropped from nearly 2 million people around 1950 to fewer than 700,000 today. The city’s demolition program is widely considered the largest ever in the US.</p>

      <h1>The Las Vegas Raiders and the thin line between tanking and incompetence</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas shut down their two stars, angered their leader and were humiliated by the Giants. Whether it’s strategy or dysfunction, the result looks the same</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders made waves this week by putting its two, and only, stars on injured reserve ahead of the final two games that will decide the 2026 NFL draft order. Tight end Brock Bowers and edge rusher Maxx Crosby were shut down from a consequential battle for the top draft pick against the Giants and a Week 18 game against Kansas City due to nagging knee injuries. Bowers had scored four touchdowns over the past five weeks for a team that doesn’t score many points. Crosby is a human wrecking ball who has amassed 28 tackles for loss this season. He’s the player that causes opponents to lose sleep. Both Bowers and Crosby were recently named to the Pro Bowl despite their nagging injuries. Bowers stepped away quietly. Crosby did not.</p>
<p>A fuming Crosby left the Raiders facility Friday. The next day he <a href="https://x.com/MLFootball/status/2005116248653447578?s=20">sent a message to the organization</a> by posting videos of himself playing basketball with his young daughter. He did not appear particularly injured.</p>

      <h1>As the US media floundered this year, I couldn’t help but think: ‘Thank God I’m at the Guardian’ | Moira Donegan</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Other outlets have asked their writers to compromise, but the Guardian has never – and would never – ask me to pull a punch</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It might be most generous to characterize the behavior of major US media organizations since 2024 as negotiating between competing incentives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, billionaires have consolidated their ownership over major news outlets and platforms. The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.</p>

<p>A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped.

      <h1>Why haven’t Trump’s tariffs crashed the US economy? | Jeffrey Frankel</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Effects on inflation and employment have not been as bad as feared – but could still materialise with full force in 2026</p>
<p>When Donald Trump took office last January, most economists feared what would happen if he raised tariffs. The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.</p>
<p>Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violating <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250318_Trump-and-the-World-Economy.pdf?x85095">international</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9ggbn0dgp37jkknk0rxpu/2025-05-13-Jeffrey-Frankel-Taking-a-Sledgehammer-to-US-Global-Leadership-Trump-s-Tariffs.mp4?rlkey=9iw66ek8uh5kyqwnf59ptt6qr&amp;e=2&amp;st=s51qydmr&amp;dl=0ido">agreements</a> and blowing up the Republican party’s <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans">oft-professed</a> commitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of his <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trump-tariffs-economic-cost-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-05">first term</a>, and even beyond the infamous <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm">Smoot-Hawley Act</a> of 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025">average effective tariff</a> on US imports rose from <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/">2% to 18%</a>, the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and large <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trumps-tariffs-cause-recession-experts/story?id=120329597">adverse</a> effects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.</p>

<p>A Montreal restaurant owner who has made giving back to the community a priority was shocked after some diners skipped out on their bill on Christmas Eve. But after posting the incident on social media, someone offered to pay the tab.</p>

<p>A lot of mainstream auto media coverage right now is pushing the idea that some EVs are “dying.” What we’re <em>really</em> seeing is a wave of end-of-cycle, first-generation vehicles making way for their next-gen replacements — and, historically, that’s when buyers get the best deals.</p>
<p>If that’s what <em>you’re</em> after, these are the EVs you should be looking at right now.</p>

<p>Copper, the metal that underpins the fast-growing renewable energy industry, is on course for its biggest annual price rise in more than 15 years as traders react to fears of global shortages.</p>

      <h1>‘Just like so many families’: US parents of addicted kids relate to the Reiners – but fear stigma</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>The challenges of drug and alcohol addiction are familiar, but violence against others is highly unusual, parents say</p>
<p>When news broke that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been killed and a possible suspect was their son, Nick Reiner, who had struggled with addiction and mental health issues, it brought addiction back into the public spotlight. But parents who have been affected by their children’s addiction fear the conversation will focus on the exceedingly rare act of violence instead of the more widespread risks.</p>
<p>Ron Grover and his wife, Darlene, have been glued to the news. They only knew the Reiners by their work, but they feel a connection: Grover’s son also became addicted at 15 to opioids and then heroin, much like Nick Reiner, and he was in and out of rehab and jail for years. But after seven excruciating years, Grover’s son got sober in July 2010.</p>

Today, we're chatting with an economist brave enough to look uncertainty in the eye and make some predictions for 2026 about the stock market, job market, inflation, and the fate of President Donald Trump's tariffs. And later: Applications for adjustable-rate mortgages have more than doubled over the past year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>

<p>Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.</p>
<p>Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.</p>
<p>57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.</p>

      <p>This year turned out to be a pretty big year for autonomous vehicles. Waymo is the leader in the robotaxi race and over the last year, its signature Jaguar electric vehicles have become a common sight on the streets and recently freeways of cities around the country.</p>
<p>Companies like Uber and Zooks have expanded their fleets to several metropolitan areas. And Tesla finally rolled out its cybercab service in a limited capacity in Austin.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke to Kirsten Korosec, transportation editor at TechCrunch, about how the robotaxi became a common fixture on city streets this year.</p>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Extraordinary golf was often overshadowed by Donald Trump, colourful fans, crazy MCs and tempers flaring</p>
<p>I was out by the practice green late afternoon on the Monday of the Ryder Cup and so was Bryson DeChambeau. He was on his own, signing autographs for the handful of people on the other side of the railings, and there was this one woman leaning over towards him, a bottle blonde, late middle-aged, in a tight white dress.</p>
<p>She was only a couple of feet away from him, but she was screaming in his ear like she was trying to reach someone across the far side of the course. “We love you Bryson! Bryson! We love you! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald!”</p>

<p>This year, many people travelled across the country for leisure. Others trekked or biked across Canada  to raise money for worthy causes. Paul Jenkins also spent 2025 travelling from coast to coast. But while many would call his journey a worthy one, his motivation was neither for pleasure nor fundraising.</p>

      <p>Snowy holiday season in the upper midwest and north-east comes as a cold front is expected to hit the south</p>
<p>A powerful winter storm was sweeping east from the Plains on Sunday, driven by what meteorologists describe as an intense cyclone that is expected to impact much of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-weather">US</a> with a mixture of snow, ice, rain and strong winds.</p>
<p>“Part of the storm system is getting heavy snow, other parts of the storm along the cold front are getting higher winds and much colder temperatures as the front passes,” said Bob Oravec, a lead forecaster at the National Weather Service (NWS) office in College Park, Maryland. “They’re all related to each other – different parts of the country will be receiving different effects from this storm.”</p>

<p>Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI.

(date: 2025-12-28)
      <p>
      <p>As the US faces challenges to public school funding, activists warn that more people should pay attention to what’s happened in Inglewood, California</p>
<p>Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.</p>
<p>By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome. When the 2028 Olympics roll around, Inglewood is slated to host many of the events as the world watches.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Cody Adams, 33, charged with manslaughter after neighbor blocks away was killed as he was firing at a drink can</p>
<p>A man in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.</p>
<p>As told in court documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138">NBC News</a>, the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely. Adams’s back yard was not equipped to stop bullets from leaving the property and striking unsuspecting people in the surrounding area, according to authorities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/democrats-trump-elections">Democrats’ soul-searching</a> began even before it was clear Donald Trump would return to the White House. But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.</p>
<p>One diagnosis, however, drew striking consensus: Democrats had allowed themselves to be drowned out online by the right’s vast – and well-funded – digital army.</p>

      <p>Michael Pham fled communist Vietnam by boat as a child. Now, as bishop of San Diego, he is putting faith into action</p>
<p>Nearly 50 years ago, a 13-year-old boarded a tiny fishing boat from communist Vietnam with more than a hundred other people. His intended destination: anywhere but there. The boat drifted through the Pacific Ocean for three days and four nights, dodging violent storms,massive waves, even a pirating ship. For the entirety of the journey, the teenager had no food or water.</p>
<p>He survived the voyage, later took shelter in a Malaysian refugee camp, and was eventually granted asylum in the United States.</p>

<p>In what appears to be significant strategic pivot, Samsung SDI will begin supplying prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems under a fresh US contract worth more than 2 trillion won (~$1.35 billion). The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old girl at the center of a case, which quickly gained national attention in the US over the weekend, was reportedly kidnapped in the Houston suburb of Porter.

      <p>
      <p>The California Democrat believes common ground does not only lie in the center – and has the successes to prove it</p>
<p>It was mid-December, and Ro Khanna was watching the calendar. The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed. And when the deadline arrived, while the justice department didn’t release everything, thousands of new files, connections and photographs began to complete the picture on what Khanna calls “the Epstein class … rich and powerful men who still have buildings named after them, who still are on corporations, are still in positions of prestige, who engage in heinous conduct.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine. From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> – to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Overdoses have been declining nationally since the fall of 2023, and public health experts have been unable to agree as to why. The decline has been uneven across states, and West Virginia, long known as the epicenter of the opioid crisis, is also among the states that have most reduced overdose fatalities, as noted in a recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis">Guardian</a> analysis.</p>
<p>One little explored factor is the increased adoption of crisis intervention training (CIT) for law enforcement. Early <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772998/pdf/qxaf003.pdf">research that compares jurisdictions</a> that have CIT programs to those that do not show that this intervention is associated with a decline in overdose fatalities.</p>

      <h1>Clergy abuse survivors frustrated by New Orleans archdiocese’s protracted bankruptcy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Long-winded legal wrangling and recalcitrant Catholic church leadership thwarted hopes for timely settlement</p>
<p>An image of his great-grandmother stayed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/new-orleans-clergy-abuse-survivors-judge">James Adams</a> for years and strengthened his faith: she was withered, nearly blind, touching his cheeks when they sat together, as if the feel of his face gave her sight. A working woman whose husband, a police officer, killed himself, she raised four children; her faith was a rock against life’s travails. She died at 98, when Adams was 28, about to marry.</p>
<p>Many years later, in 2020, Adams, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> banker, was president of the Catholic Community Foundation, the archdiocese’s fundraising arm, when Archbishop Gregory Aymond ousted him – as he’s recounted from a witness stand in court and in multiple media interviews. Overnight, Adams became a church enemy because of what a priest did to him as a boy. His story mirrors the legal saga that has tarnished Aymond’s career.</p>

<p>A California family is celebrating their first holiday following the delivery of their latest child, a baby that had been growing outside of the mother’s womb.</p>
<p>Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old emergency room nurse in Bakersfield, California, delivered baby Ryu via surgery in August, so the newborn is celebrating his first Christmas. He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.</p>

      <p>Historically, when organizers have used tactical innovation, movement activity has peaked</p>
<p>Federal agents in military fatigues carrying assault rifles in major cities. Huge cuts to healthcare, science and the US’s largest anti-hunger <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/snap-funding-cuts-threaten-food-security-health/">program</a>. Immigrants dragged from cars and courthouse hallways. Rising authoritarianism, corruption and anti-democratic behavior. These are just some of the reasons pushback against the Trump administration is growing with each passing day.</p>
<p>While traditional marches such as the massive <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o">No Kings</a> protests are a critical part of any resistance movement, sociologist Doug McAdam has shown how <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095322">tactical innovation</a> – the introduction of creative or novel protest methods – was a key part of the success of the civil rights movement in the US. Historically, when organizers established new tactics, movement activity peaked.</p>

      <p>Drummer Chuck Redd decided to cancel his yearly Jazz Jam after Donald Trump added his name to the venue</p>
<p>The president of the Kennedy Center has demanded $1m in damages and fiercely criticized a musician’s sudden decision to cancel a Christmas Eve performance at the venue days after the White House announced that Donald Trump’s name would be added to the facility.</p>
<p>“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.</p>

      <h1>The ascendant San Antonio Spurs are the gift the NBA needed</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>By puncturing Oklahoma City’s aura of inevitability, Victor Wembanyama and co have restored suspense, drama and joy to a season that was in danger of becoming dull</p>
<p>I’ve seen enough: Give the San Antonio Spurs the keys to Santa Claus’ workshop. Put Stephon Castle in charge of toy assembly. Let De’Aaron Fox toss presents into chimneys, from whatever range he’d like. Devin Vassell can customize the Christmas cookies. Harrison Barnes has the army of elves covered. And, of course, Santa Claus’s sleigh must immediately be resized for a taller, thinner pilot so that the towering Victor Wembanyama can drive it comfortably. The sensational Spurs have felled the Oklahoma City Thunder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/nba-christmas-games-scores">three times in two weeks</a>, and in doing so revitalized this NBA season. I now have more faith in the Spurs’ ability to grant joy to the masses than any holiday legends of old.</p>
<p>It looked dire for a while there. The Thunder might have won the Larry O’Brien trophy in June, but began this season in even more ominous form. They reeled off 24 wins in their first 25 games (the lone loss was a fluky 20-point comeback). In most of them, Jalen Williams, their second-best player, was on the sidelines recovering from wrist surgery. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, their best, seldom had to play in fourth quarters. The Thunder beat the Sacramento Kings by 31. The Los Angeles Lakers, who some expected to be a plausible rival, lost by 29; their basketball savant Luka Doncic looked like he was playing against ten men. The Phoenix Suns’ valiant first earned them a close loss, by just four points. When they met again 12 days later, the Thunder won by 49. This game knocked all the remaining leaves off the trees and started winter 10 days ahead of schedule. Oklahoma City looked capable of shredding anything in its path, even the 2016 Golden State Warriors’ legendary regular season record of 73-9.</p>

      <h1>Epstein texts and yelling at Trump: US House’s year of censures</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Lawmakers spent much of 2025 seeking to reprimand each other – here’s a look back at what sparked such outrage</p>
<p>It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers broke the record for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/hakeem-jeffries-house-speech-trump-tax-bill">longest floor speech</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/house-breaks-longest-vote-record-genius-act">longest vote</a>, and presided over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">the lengthiest government shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>They also spent plenty of time seeking to reprimand each other by passing censures, as the House’s formal mechanism for discipline is known. A search on Congress.gov reveals at least 17 attempts since the start of the year to condemn another lawmaker, in the form of a censure or a less formal disapproval resolution.</p>

<p>It’s official. The word “sustainable” is gone from Tesla’s mission statement.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Tesla’s guiding star was arguably the most impactful corporate mission statement of the 21st century. But over the last few years, we have watched the company slowly drift away from its environmental roots.</p>
<p>Now, Elon Musk has confirmed the final step in that divorce, rebranding the company’s goal from “Sustainable Abundance” to simply “Amazing Abundance.”</p>

      <h1>‘Weapons of mass construction’: the US ‘craftivists’ using yarn to fight back against Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>Fiber artists across the US are using their craft to protest against everything from national guard deployments to rollbacks on abortion rights</p>
<p>In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”.</p>

      <p>Now that Christmas presents are unwrapped, many of you — you know who you are — will head to stores to return gifts and get what you actually want. But increasingly, retailers are charging for those returns. Then, a couple of months ago, more than 5 million shoppers embraced a boycott of three major retailers: Amazon, Home Depot, and Target. From <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/this-is-uncomfortable-reema-khrais">&quot;This Is Uncomfortable,&quot;</a> we'll learn about the impact it had on shoppers.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>The president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmed</p>
<p>For more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.</p>
<p>But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv">The Apprentice</a>, appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.</p>

      <p>Texas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSD</p>
<p>For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.</p>
<p>Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> There's one word that's dominated the headlines this year: tariffs. Countries around the world have been grappling with the U.S. import taxes central to President Donald Trump's trade policy, so how are countries faring? We check in on Mexico, China, and others. Plus, the Trump administration eliminated the tax exemption for parcels under $800 this year. We investigate how the move is playing out four months on.</p>

<p>The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.</p>
<p>It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.</p>

      <p>When Trump began deploying troops to US cities, Janessa Goldbeck’s Vet Voice Foundation was ready – now they’re preparing for what may be next</p>
<p>Whatever the worst-case scenario, <a href="https://vvfnd.org/about/our-team/">Janessa Goldbeck</a> has probably imagined it.

      <p>Imran Ahmed, an anti-disinformation advocate, claims he is being targeted for scrutinising social media companies</p>
<p>A British anti-disinformation campaigner close to Keir Starmer’s chief of staff has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration after being told he could face deportation from the US in a row over freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), has filed a complaint against senior Trump allies including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, in an attempt to prevent what he says would be an unconstitutional arrest and removal.</p>

      <p>Are her recent candid remarks about Trump an attempt to distance herself from an increasingly unpopular president?</p>
<p>She was now one of the family. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> addressed supporters in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in early December, <a href="https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1998551432350544325?s=20">he asked</a>: “Susie Trump – do you know Susie Trump? Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles.”</p>
<p>The US president was referring to his chief of staff, who he said had persuaded him to return to the campaign trail ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. But a week later, Wiles appeared at risk of becoming the family outcast.</p>

      <p>From emancipation to women’s suffrage, civil rights and BLM, mass movement has shaped the arc of US history</p>
<p>Trump’s first and second terms have been marked by huge protests, from the 2017 Women’s March to the protests for racial justice after George Floyd’s murder, to this year’s No Kings demonstrations. But how <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2025/04/03/is-there-any-point-to-protesting-in-trumps-second-term/">effective</a> is this type of collective action?</p>
<p>According to historians and political scientists who study protest: very. From emancipation to women’s suffrage, from civil rights to Black Lives Matter, mass movement has shaped the arc of American history. Protest has led to the passage of legislation that gave women the right to vote, banned segregation and legalized same-sex marriage. It has also sparked cultural shifts in how Americans perceive things like bodily autonomy, economic inequality and racial bias.</p>

      <p>It felt like nothing would top Tiger Woods’s Masters win, but then the Northern Irishman completed his career grand slam on an extraordinary final day at Augusta</p>
<p>At 7am on 14 April in an Augusta rental home, Rory McIlroy awoke and immediately spotted a Green Jacket draped over a chair. “You think: ‘Yeah, that did happen yesterday,’” he says. “That.” McIlroy was now the sixth man to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/14/rory-mcilroy-secures-career-grand-slam-after-dramatic-masters-playoff-win-over-justin-rose">win all four of golf’s majors</a>.</p>
<p>The detail of what lay around in the bedroom of my own Augusta billet is of no interest to anybody. That was, however, a memorable morning. I had previously and wrongly believed nothing would top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/14/masters-tiger-woods-molinari-finau-schauffele-koepka">Tiger Woods’s 2019 Masters win</a> in respect of seismic reaction. Scores of messages from friends, colleagues, family members – umpteen of whom have no interest whatsoever in golf – had landed. Broadcast outlets across the world wanted my assessment of what had played out on Masters Sunday. Yeah, that did happen yesterday.</p>

<p>The US justice department said on Wednesday that it has been told by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the FBI that they have uncovered more than a million more documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case and processing these for release could take “a few more weeks”.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TheJusticeDept/status/2003901580341334257">In a post on X</a>, the justice department said it had received the documents from the US attorney for the southern district of New York and the FBI in “compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, existing statutes, and judicial orders”.</p>

<p>Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year’s devastating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a>, but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we’re in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.</p>

<p>Happy holidays! Across the 12 days of Christmas one very keen individual once gifted their lover a partridge in a pear tree, two turtle doves, three French hens, four calling birds, five gold rings, six geese a-laying, seven swans a-swimming, eight maids a-milking, nine ladies dancing, 10 lords a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming.</p>
<p>An extravagant expression of what was allegedly “true love”, the spree amounted to a total of 364 presents – more if you include the eggs that the geese a-laid.</p>

      <h1>Maybe going into the office isn't so bad?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>2025 has been the year of getting dragged back to the office for plenty of workers — some part-time, but many full-time in the case of big finance and tech corporations. Thing is, in-person work appeals to many younger workers. Today, we'll hear the perspective of one. Then, the State Department says it will deny visas to five European citizens, including a former top EU official, and domestic production is still adjusting to tariffs.</p>

      <h1>Fresh ‘manty’ and cheap figs: a post-Soviet supermarket becomes a must-visit spot in NYC</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone</p>
<p>When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like <em>manty</em> – intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or <em>chak-chak</em>, a dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey syrup. <em>Kompot,</em> too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.</p>
<p>Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home. <em>Manty</em> was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin, yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade <em>kompot</em> with fruits and berries from our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered <em>chak-chak</em>, the store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.</p>

<p>Republicans are attempting to exempt some major polluters from paying for Pfas “forever chemical” cleanup. If successful, it could mark a major setback in US effort to rein in Pfas pollution.</p>
<p>The Republican-led House energy and commerce committee recently <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/environment-subcommittee-holds-hearing-on-the-current-statutory-and-regulatory-landscape-of-pfas">held a hearing</a> at which it invited representatives from the water treatment and landfill industries, among others, to make the case about why they should be exempted from rules that hold polluters financially accountable for the cleanup of two types of dangerous Pfas.</p>

      <p>Critics compare offensive to Iraq war, citing familiar mix of regime-change rhetoric, security pretexts and oil interests</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, <a href="https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430">invoking</a> drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.

      <h1>Is Trump mentally OK? A look back at the president’s unusual behavior in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity</p>
<p>In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408">claimed</a> that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.</p>
<p>“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.</p>
<p>America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”</p>
<p>I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.</p>
<p>We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”</p>

      <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore Homeland Security funding to 12 states and the District of Columbia. The administration had held back hundreds of millions of dollars from what it called &quot;sanctuary jurisdictions.&quot; The cuts affected programs intended to support local police and emergency response in urban areas. Plus, food banks are bracing for strain ahead of changes to SNAP. We hear how services will be impacted on the ground in Kentucky.</p>

<p>An Alberta chocolatier brought a distinctly Canadian flavour to the baking show Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking, a magical experience she says taught her to think bigger. Priya Winsor of St. Albert, Alta., said the show pushed her well beyond her comfort zone, particularly when it came to constructing large-scale edible showpieces.</p>

      <h1>How the Guardian reported 2025, with editor-in-chief Katharine Viner</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Katharine Viner</strong>, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells <strong>Annie Kelly</strong> what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.</p>
<p>In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’</p>
<p>It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even more</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>From the Super Bowl to UFC cards to the US Open to the Ryder Cup, the US president has turned sport into his own personal stage. There’s more to come</p>
<p>Considering he’s the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/donald-trump-hard-work">self-declared hardest working</a> president to ever hold the office, Donald Trump has spent a remarkable amount of the past year away from it. In 2025, he loomed over sports like no American politician before him, his visits to stadiums and arenas and golf courses and race tracks so frequent they began to feel like part of the job description. But if Trump’s presence on the sporting scene has seemed hard to escape, gird yourselves for 2026, when the American presidency no longer merely intersects with sport but threatens to subsume it. The World Cup is on the way, the Olympics are right behind it, a UFC card is coming to the White House lawn (not a joke) and the commander-in-chief’s well-documented fondness for jumbotrons is becoming less of a habit than a dependency.</p>

      <h1>Alex Sarama: how a 30-year-old Englishman became an WNBA head coach</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Portland Fire are set for their debut season in the WNBA. Their coach has completed an unlikely journey to the top of his sport</p>
<p>As an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved. For the British-born Sarama, who on 28 October was named the head coach of the WNBA’s newest expansion team, the Portland Fire, people doubted him before he even put two sentences together.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died. The inspector general report, released Tuesday, suggests that a new mandate in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill could help reduce these kind of payments. The bill requires states to audit Medicaid beneficiary lists against the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File. Privacy laws currently restrict access to this file. The report recommends states comply with the new mandate to conduct quarterly death checks to prevent further improper payments.</p>

<p>There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and being included in the files does not indicate any criminal wrongdoing.</p>

      <h1>Trump administration bans US veterans agency from providing abortions</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>Department of Veterans Affairs says justice department found procedure not to be legally sound</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs can no longer provide abortions to veterans, including in cases of rape or incest, following a Department of Justice memo that found last week that the practice was not legally sound.</p>
<p>The ban follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VAto counsel veterans and their families about abortion, as well as offer the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy imperiled their health. In August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals">the administration filed paperwork</a> to officially roll back the policy, which had helped the VA’s network of 1,300-plus healthcare facilities – which treat nearly 10 million veterans each year – expand access to abortion, especially in the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade.</p>

<p>If you’ve covered e-bikes as long as I have, you’ll know two things about them: they’re an awesome way to get around, and the basic technology behind an e-bike motor hasn’t radically changed in a long, long time. However, based on the new e-bike motor design I just tested from a powertrain technology company called <a href="https://www.chargebike.co/">CHARGE</a>, the e-bike world may be about to get turned on its head. These guys discovered that nearly any e-bike hub motor can perform regenerative braking, but everyone has just been building them wrong this whole time.</p>

      <p>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump</p>
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.</p>
<p>The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.</p>
<p>Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.</p>
<p>Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests">Multiple references to Donald Trump</a>, including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Files featuring redactions that were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media">found to be removable</a> through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.</p>

      <p>A little over a week ago, Disney became the first major media company to strike a content licensing deal with Sora, OpenAI's short-form video platform. This means that people on Sora can start making videos with Disney characters. Today, we'll chat about what it means for consumers, the companies, and artists in the entertainment industry. But first: GDP growth jumped in the third quarter, and it was not just consumers buying stuff.</p>

      <h1>‘Haunted and cursed’: Lake Lanier has a deadly reputation. A darker tale hides beneath the surface</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>After years of fatalities and bizarre incidents, the Georgia reservoir has spawned countless ghost stories. Are they merely legend or the aftereffects of a history steeped in racial trauma?</p>
<p>Kile Glover was the entertainer in the family, the pride of his stepfather, the R&amp;B superstar Usher. He sang, he danced – he burned CDs of his own music, styled the covers with self-made art and was otherwise expressing his creativity in internet videos before it was trendy. “He would’ve been a YouTube sensation by now,” says his mother, the celebrity stylist Tameka Foster. But that future was thwarted on a family trip to Lake Lanier, just outside his Atlanta home town, in July 2012.</p>
<p>Kile was only 11 when he was struck by a speeding jetski while tubing and knocked unconscious. Foster, on the island of Saint Martin at the time, managed to get to Kile’s hospital bedside within hours thanks to Usher sending a private plane – an olive branch that came amid a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tameka-raymond-ushers-status-helped-win-custody/story?id=19969051">bitterly public</a> custody battle over their two younger sons. As Kile lay on life support, Foster passed the time Googling for information about Lake Lanier. She is still horrified by what she learned.</p>

U.S. regulators have now approved a much less expensive alternative; Novo Nordisk has gotten the green light for an oral version of Wegovy. Pills are cheaper to manufacture than injectables, and that could be a game-changer. Then, consumers still feel pessimistic heading into the new year, and more Americans are staying unemployed for longer.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The number of people in immigration detention in the US has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration">hit an all-time high</a>, according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p><strong>What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?</strong> In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">no criminal record</a> continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)</p>
<p><strong>How are ordinary people fighting back?</strong> As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back">Julia Carrie Wong reports</a> on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.</p>
<p><strong>What did Trump say about Clinton?</strong> “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?</strong> The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action">a resolution</a> directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>By representing its region’s distinct culture and players, the Canadian Premier League team aims to boost the province’s undoubted soccer potential</p>
<p>Boulevard Saint-Laurent is one of Montréal’s great arteries, a throughway for gourmands coveting smoked meat sandwiches or proper pizza at one of a dozen different joints in Little Italy. It’s also home to Evangelista Sports, a shop that has doubled as a shrine to the city’s soccer-obsessed for more than 40 years and is every bit a part of Montréal’s cultural fabric as poutine or lamenting the cold.</p>
<p>It’s also where FC Supra du Québec opted to announce their first-ever signings last week. The Canadian Premier League (CPL) expansion team is looking to become part of the city and province’s cultural identity, hoping their commitment to recruiting a full roster of Québec-born or raised players, inspired by European clubs like Athletic Bilbao, will go a long way in helping to build a pathway which has so often seen talent slip through the cracks.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The US press have suffered about as many assaults this year as in the previous three years combined</p>
<p>The United States has seen a dramatic increase in violence against journalists since Donald Trump again took office.</p>
<p>Most of the reporters and photographers who were allegedly attacked by law enforcement officials were covering protests over the Trump administration’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a non-profit that tracks such incidents.</p>

      <p>In January, we saw a who's who of tech leaders front and center at President Donald Trump's inauguration.</p>
<p>Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.</p>
<p>To review the year in tech and Trump we called up Suyash Pasi, a research analyst and editor at the nonprofit Human Rights Research Center, who’s been following this shift.</p>

<p>Warriors forward Draymond Green had a heated exchange with his head coach, Steve Kerr, in a third-quarter huddle during Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic before leaving the court and heading to the locker room to calm down.</p>
<p>“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”</p>

<p>Adding a rooftop solar array to your home or business can be exciting <em>and</em> expensive. As such, it might be tempting to cut corners to keep costs down — but some upgrades are simply much cheaper to do while your solar system is being installed than they are to add later, and we’ve got some prime examples right here.</p>

<p>Images of the boxes, which resemble tiny padded cells, first spread on social media last week, after a <a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/12/16/social-media-posts-about-wooden-box-mohawk-school-prompts-police-investigation/">former member of the Salmon River school district school board</a> accused officials of building them to seclude children with disabilities.

      <p>Hey Smarties! We’re dropping into your feeds today to share this special coverage from Marketplace.</p>
<p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants. We visit a refugee farmer in Houston, a chocolate-making lab in California, and stop for a bite at an award-winning restaurant in Portland.</p>

      <h1>Outrage after CBS pulls 60 Minutes segment on El Salvador’s Cecot prison</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>Controversially appointed editor-in-chief Bari Weiss says: ‘I held that story and I held it because it wasn’t ready’</p>
<p>CBS News was dealing with internal and external uproar on Monday after it pulled at the last minute an investigation for its flagship 60 Minutes show into the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2025/mar/20/cecot-el-salvador-venezuela-prison-trump-deportations">harsh prison in El Salvador</a> where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans from the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The episode about the Cecot mega-prison was due to air on Sunday night. However, in an “editor’s note” <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/2002854497685582309">posted on X</a> late that afternoon, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”</p>

      <h1>Wolves’ freefall leaves even Derby’s dismal record low a lofty goal</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seen</p>
<p>Saturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a Premier League season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.</p>
<p>How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the US diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s “America first” priorities.</p>
<p>The chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two state department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has said it is immediately pausing all leases for offshore wind farms already under construction, in the heaviest blow yet to an industry that the administration has relentlessly targeted throughout the year.</p>
<p>Trump’s Department of the Interior said that it was halting the building of five wind projects due to “national security risks”. The department said it would work with the US Department of Defense to mitigate the risk of the wind turbine towers creating radar interference called “clutter” that could in some way hamper the US military.</p>

      <p>Video shared by the US Geological Survey on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone national park. Other recent eruptions have mostly been audible but not visible because they happened either at night or when the camera was obscured by ice. The agency said the Black Diamond Pool was previously the site of a hydrothermal explosion, in July 2024, that sent rocks and mud flying hundreds of feet into the air and damaged a boardwalk. It prompted the closure of the area to visitors due to the damage and potential for additional hazardous activity</p>

<p>I’ve ridden a lot of electric scooters over the years, and many of them blur together. Plenty are fast. Many are powerful. Some look aggressive. But only a handful manage to combine all of that with a ride that actually feels polished and confidence-inspiring. After spending real time riding the Apollo Phantom 2.0 (52V version), it’s clear this scooter sits firmly in that top tier.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Once loose, erratic and reliably unreliable, Jacksonville have hardened into something far more serious, with Trevor Lawrence’s control and confidence turning a hot streak into a genuine AFC threat</p>
<p>Seven weeks ago, the Jaguars were still <em>that</em> team: loose, entertaining, unreliable. The kind that could light up a quarter and then spend the next three undoing it. Now, they’re a wagon.</p>
<p>After beating the Broncos on Sunday, the Jaguars have ripped off six straight wins. They’ve won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 2007. And with two winnable games to close the season, they have a solid path to the No 1 seed, with the AFC potentially running through Jacksonville.</p>

      <p>Medetomidine has extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms – and the detox centers that help patients are struggling with how best to cope</p>
<p>The staff at harm reduction hub Sunshine House in the middle of Kensington, a neighborhood in north-east Philadelphia home to the most notorious open drug scene in the US, often reverse at least one overdose per day.</p>
<p>But the mutating illegal drug supply is regularly conjuring new drugs with novel sets of potentially deadly risks. For the past 18 months, there has been a new drug in circulation, the veterinary sedative medetomidine, also known as “rhino tranq”. It has perhaps the most extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms of all known street drugs.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files">casts fresh light</a> on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.</p>
<p><strong>The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law – can Congress do anything?</strong> Lawmakers threatening legal action face major obstacle: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/epstein-files-doj-congress">those with legal power in this case are the ones accused of failing to follow the law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Cecot being investigated?</strong> In March, the Trump administration struck a deal with El Salvador to send to Cecot more than 250 Venezuelan migrants that it accused of terrorism and gang membership. Horror stories have since emerged about abuse that they are alleged to have endured, with lawyers for some of the men who were later released describing the conditions as “state-sanctioned torture”.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact that they disagree on everything when it comes to politics, Nick and Nathan Roberts make it a point to be kind to each other</p>
<p>A pair of identical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indiana">Indiana</a> twins whose life on opposite ends of the US’s political divide recently propelled them to internet virality say it has been key for them to prioritize kindness and civility whenever they engage in conversations about politics.</p>
<p>Nick Roberts is an elected Democratic politician, and his brother Nathan Roberts is a Republican supporter of Donald Trump. Their relationship generated significant public commentary when Nick posted a <a href="http://facebook.com/reel/2452698115146550/">social media video</a> imploring his followers not to confuse him with Nathan, who runs Save Heritage Indiana, a nonprofit organization that it says is dedicated to opposing illegal immigration in the state.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, having promised to “NEVER LET OUR FARMERS DOWN”, appeared to come through for them this month when he unveiled a $12bn aid package. Industry leaders say thousands of farms will still go bust this year.</p>
<p>While the US president has vowed to increase domestic farm production, and even claimed this formed a “big part” of his plan to lower grocery prices for Americans, many US farmers are grappling with mounting financial issues – compounded by Trump’s agenda.</p>

While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.</p>

<p>Corruption is a word that’s come up throughout this year in relation to U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. There have been allegations of personal enrichment, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, through his family’s crypto and real estate ventures. There are also accusations of quid pro quo deals with foreign leaders and convicted criminals seeking pardons.
Is this a bug in Trump’s administration, or a feature?
To put it all into focus, Tommy Vietor is here. He’s been following this issue of corruption on his very popular podcast, Pod Save America. He also co-hosts Pod Save the World.

      <p>Department says image was flagged by prosecutors before determining it posed no risk to survivors of late sex offender</p>
<p>The US justice department said on Sunday it had restored an image it had removed a day earlier from the public release of investigative files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> after concluding that the photograph, which included within it a photo of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, posed no risk of public exposure to victims of the late convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>The justice department said the image had been flagged by federal prosecutors in New York for potentially exposing victims of Epstein. Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-epstein-friendship">former friend</a> of Epstein.</p>

<p>Last December, Alberta rolled out its $29-million provincial border strategy in response to tariff threats from Donald Trump. But nearly one year later, Premier Danielle Smith says her government has learned the Coutts border crossing isn’t a hub of illicit activity — and that could lead to a focus on other areas.</p>

<p>Caleb Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore in overtime, and the Chicago Bears overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter Saturday night for a 22-16 win over the Green Bay Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love to a concussion.</p>
<p>The Bears (11-4) extended their lead in the NFC North to one and a half games over the Packers (9-5-1) with two left to play and got some payback for a loss at Lambeau Field two weeks earlier. It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.</p>

<p>A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.</p>
<p>Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.</p>
<p>Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”</p>
<p>The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

      <h1>US intercepts second merchant vessel off coast of Venezuela in international waters</h1>

(date: 2025-12-20)
      <p>
      <p>Vessel does not appear to be on list of US-sanctioned vessels, which would represent escalation in blockade</p>
<p>US forces on Saturday apprehended a second merchant vessel carrying oil off the coast of Venezuela in international waters in the midst of an American blockade against the country’s oil, according to the US homeland security department.</p>
<p>The stoppage follows the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seizure</a> by US forces of another oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast on 10 December. Both vessels were headed to Asia.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.</p>

<p>Administration officials defended the redactions with fervent hyperbole. “Never in American history has a President or the Department of Justice been this transparent with the American people about such a sensitive law enforcement matter,” said Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who released <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims">a six-page letter describing the redaction process</a>.</p>

      <p>The Golden State’s clean energy use hit new highs in 2025. As the Trump administration abandons US climate initiatives, can California fill the void?</p>
<p>As officials from around the world met in Brazil for the Cop30 climate summit last month, the US president was nowhere to be found, nor were any members of his cabinet. Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>.</p>
<p>During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/11/gavin-newsom-trump-cop30">invasive species</a>” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.</p>

<p>The prohibition on “live fire” training that includes animals is part of this year’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/defense-bill-boat-strikes-hegseth-a0886906eb50432c38a4d5bf08e6a719">annual defense bill</a>, although other uses of animals for wartime training will continue. The ban was championed by Vern Buchanan, a Republican congressman from Florida who often focuses on animal rights issues.</p>

<p>Lindsey Vonn’s expectations have shifted so dramatically during her Olympic comeback that even a podium finish now comes with a sense of frustration.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old American finished third in Saturday’s women’s World Cup downhill at Val d’Isère, France, extending a blistering start to the season that has already included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41">a victory</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/13/lindsey-vonn-second-emma-aicher-world-cup-downhill-st-moritz">a runner-up finish</a> in the space of nine days. But after a small mistake on the lower section of the course cost her valuable time, Vonn left the finish area convinced she had let a potential win slip away.</p>

      <p>Anthony Joshua has said he wants to take on Tyson Fury next, after knocking Jake Paul out in the sixth round of their fight in Miami on Friday night. Joshua dropped Paul four times in the one-sided affair, and then called out Fury – even impersonating his fellow British heavyweight as he urged him to 'sign the contract'. On YouTuber turned boxer Paul, who went to hospital with a broken jaw, Joshua said: 'Jake has spirit, he has some heart. He tried his best and I take my hat off to him.'</p>

Climate scientists from the first all-Canadian expedition in March hope it offers the chance to collect more samples, as preliminary results come in from the earlier research mission.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice on Friday released a long-awaited and huge tranche of documents detailing its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major development in the lengthy saga that turned into one of the biggest political setbacks Donald Trump has suffered since his re-election last year.</p>
<p>While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice on Friday released some long-awaited files related to the convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, but did not release everything in its possession as required by a law Congress passed last month. The partial release drew swift rebukes from Capitol Hill and threats of legal action.</p>
<p>Speaking in an <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/2002002424739864985">interview</a> on Fox News on Friday morning, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein”.</p>

<p>Thirty members of Congress are demanding answers from Dollar General and Family Dollar, requesting internal documents about widespread disparities between shelf prices and register prices at the dollar-store chains’ 28,000 US stores.</p>
<p>The demand for answers – detailed in a <a href="https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/budzinski.house.gov/uploads/2025/12/Letter-to-Dollar-General-and-Family-Dollar-re_-Price-Transparency-12-19-2025.pdf">letter</a> sent on Friday to the CEOs of both companies – comes as the direct result of a 3 December Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/customers-pay-more-rising-dollar-store-costs">investigation</a> of the two national chains. The investigation found that Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span.</p>

<p>The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.</p>

Thing is, the transaction will likely draw close regulatory scrutiny from the Trump administration. But first: messy economic data and a deal to buy TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: sepia-toned Bears v Packers rivalry takes center stage</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Chicago can edge closer to sealing the NFC North in a sepia-toned Soldier Field showdown that headlines a pivotal week in the NFL playoff race</p>
<p>Another week as the NFL winds up for the postseason offers a fresh look at contenders building for the Super Bowl. Jacksonville v Denver, yes please. Baltimore v New England, bingo. Pittsburgh v Detroit, hmm … OK. Still not satisfied? The strange lights of Saturday night over in the NFC North should do the trick with a sepia-toned showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. A win for either and a Detroit defeat confirms a playoff slot while victory for the Bears gets them close to sealing the division (even in defeat the Packers still will be ahead for the seventh seed). The gaping hole left by Micah Parsons in Green Bay’s defensive front may have Chicago fans edging to the side of expectation that their Bears can put together a deep playoff run if home-field advantage is on their side.</p>

<p>Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal advocacy group behind the overturning of Roe v Wade, has ramped up its global spending on litigation and other campaigns, in what appears to be an attempt to export what critics call its <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/alliance-defending-freedom/">hard-right Christian theocratic values</a> beyond US borders.</p>

      <p>EPA proposed undoing Biden-era policy on exposure to carcinogenic toxin in latest push to weaken toxin standards</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s Environmental Protection Agency ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa">EPA</a>) is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca/epa-releases-updated-draft-risk-calculation-memorandum-formaldehyde-under-tsca">proposing</a> to increase the levels of exposure to highly carcinogenic formaldehyde it considers safe. If successful, people would continue to be exposed to concerning amounts of the toxin in thousands of everyday products used across the economy, experts and advocates say.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde, a pungent colorless gas at room temperature, is found in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, home cleaners, craft supplies, leather goods, furniture, clothing, plastic, building materials and other everyday goods. During <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s term, EPA scientists took a major step toward reining in the broad societal risk by issuing a finding that any level of exposure to formaldehyde can cause cancer, and very low levels cause non-cancer health harms.</p>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Electricity prices are up 6.9% year over year — much higher than overall inflation — and costs are expected to go up even more in the future. So, how are energy-hungry data centers, used to power AI, crypto, and more, impacting electric bills? That's a question that several Senate Democrats had, who opened an investigation into tech firms this week. Also on the show: TikTok ownership and real estate agents' thoughts on the market.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A man suspected of killing two people and wounding nine others at Brown University before going on to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/suspect-brown-university-shooting">has been found dead</a> in a New Hampshire storage facility, where he had rented a unit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How has the White House responded to the</strong> <strong>incident?</strong> The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has ordered the suspension of the green card lottery program at Donald Trump’s direction, saying it had enabled the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to enter the US.</p>
<p><strong>What did Volodymyr Zelenskyy say about the deal?</strong> The Ukrainian president wrote on social media that the deal “is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.”</p>

      <p>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience</p>
<p>When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.</p>
<p>In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.</p>

<p>The images, released on Thursday, are undated and lack captions or context. Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita, which is about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl, written on different parts of a woman’s body.</p>

<p>Authorities said Thursday that they’re looking into a connection between last weekend’s mass shooting at Brown University and one two days later near Boston that killed a professor at another elite school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>That is according to three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss an investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the people said investigators had identified a person of interest in the shootings and were actively seeking that individual.</p>

      <h1>Pope’s naming of New York archbishop signals continued challenge to Trump on immigration</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Ronald Hicks, who endorsed message condemning ICE raids, to lead one of biggest US archdioceses</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-leo-xiv">Pope Leo XIV</a> has named a fellow Chicagoan as the next archbishop of New York, one of the biggest US archdioceses, in a signal that the church will continue its stance against the Trump administration on immigration.</p>
<p>The US-born pope chose 58-year-old Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, to lead the church in New York, replacing retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan who has served for 16 years after being selected by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.</p>

      <h1>From Keir as Eliot Ness to Radon Liz on YouTube – the 2025 alternative politics awards</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>With the Christmas recess slowing the political havoc, it’s time to hand out the Guardian’s parliamentarian of the year awards</p>
<p>You can hear the sighs of relief. Not from the MPs who are packing up to slope back to their constituencies for the Christmas recess, but from the rest of the country. Finally, the year is coming to an end and there will be few chances for our politicians to do any further damage before they return to Westminster in January.</p>
<p>The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up.</p>

      <h1>Deadline nears for release of Epstein files – what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department must release most documents by Friday, and failure to do so would provoke a firestorm</p>
<p>In less than 48 hours, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release most of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">files</a> related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in its possession. Last month, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi">subsequently pledged</a> to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.</p>

<p>The New York Times columnist David Brooks appeared in multiple photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein that were released on Thursday by the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p>
<p>The photos, which have been rolled out in batches by the minority Democrats in the committee, lack crucial context, including dates and locations. But the photos appear to show Brooks attending a lunch or dinner event. Brooks is shown seated next to Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.</p>

<p>As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>Over what the magazine said was 11 separate interviews by reporter Chris Whipple, Susie Wiles spoke candidly about her colleagues, describing Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, JD Vance, the vice-president, as being a “conspiracy theorist for a decade” and Russell Vought, the budget chief, as a “right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>

      <p>First female appointment to a major oil company has faced fierce resistance from climate activists as boss of Woodside</p>
<p>The surprise appointment of BP’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive">third chief executive in a tumultuous five years</a> reflects the embattled fossil fuel producer’s need for profound change. The hiring of Meg O’Neill appears to offer exactly that.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, is the first female head of a major oil company, and the first “outsider” to be hired to a position usually reserved for company veterans. She joins from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside, where she took up her first chief executive role only four years ago.</p>

Top White House officials, including JD Vance and Stephen Miller, repeatedly publicly vowed that a crackdown was coming. In particular, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">government focused</a> on “Antifa.” short for antifascist, is not an organization but rather an ideology that broadly describes a variety of left-leaning beliefs.</p>

<p>A year into his second term, Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies">pledge</a> to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” has already made an indelible mark on the nation.</p>
<p>Nearly 300,000 people have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data">deported</a>, and a record 65,000 people are being held in detention centers. Aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, sometimes with the backing of federalized national guard units, have terrorized immigrant communities from Charlotte to Chicago, New Orleans to New York. Enabled by a supreme court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/supreme-court-immigration-los-angeles-reaction">ruling</a> that “effectively legalized racial profiling”, immigration enforcement has separated families, forced targeted individuals to miss work, school and doctors appointments, and caused communities to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/latino-festivals-cancelled-ice-immigration-raids">cancel festivals</a> and gatherings.</p>

      <p>The cost of living in November was up 2.7% from a year ago, according to a report Thursday from the Labor Department. That's a smaller annual increase than for the 12 months ending in September.</p>

      <h1>Analysis: how prices for the cheapest World Cup tickets have rocketed</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men’s World Cup, compared with current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most fans</p>
<p>In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.</p>
<p>An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry">1.6% of sellable tickets</a> for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.</p>

      <p>As the year draws to a close, it's clear that the post-COVID hiring bonanza has ended, and job-hunting has gotten trickier. Experts are predicting next year to be marked by more of the same: a low-hire, low-fire labor market. Plus, the Nasdaq asks the SEC for permission to allow close to 24/7 trading, and a federal appeals court is blocking the firing of most workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The European Union says it's close to agreeing a trade deal with the South American economic bloc Mercosur, which represents Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The agreement covers all aspects of trade, but the most controversial area is agriculture. Farmers have been protesting because they fear a glut of cheap imports. Then, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever roadmap for tackling a Europe-wide housing affordability crisis earlier this week. We'll discuss it with the EU's housing Commissioner.</p>

<p>The 364,000 sq ft warehouse in the suburbs outside Chicago is just one of Learning Resources’ investments in the US. The company and its affiliated brands employ more than 500 people. They make about 2,000 different products, mostly educational toys such as children’s binoculars, cash registers and learning games.</p>

<p>Canadians under 35 missed credit payments at higher rates in the third quarter than they did at the same time last year, and they're seeking debt relief services in higher numbers, as living costs are outpacing wages. The popularity of &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plans could be making the problem worse. CBC's Jenna Benchetrit explains</p>

<p>Venezuela's bitumen-heavy oil is virtually identical to Canada's and the South American country has the largest proven reserves in the world. But Venezuelan oil has essentially disappeared from world markets over the past 20 years. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to invade Venezuela have opened up the prospect that it could one day return, with huge implications for Canada.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The defensive end’s pursuit of the NFL sack record defies belief, raising questions about what his perpetually rebuilding team should do about it</p>
<p>The NFL sack record is one of those hallowed figures in professional sports. Michael Strahan’s 22.5 lingered for two decades not because pass rushers failed to get better, but because everything has to break just right for someone to reach it. You need volume. You need game scripts. You need offenses chasing points. When TJ Watt finally tied it in 2021, it felt like he had reached the outer limit. The record had been touched, but not broken.</p>
<p>Myles Garrett has spent this season treating that assumption with contempt. Now, he’s a couple of plays away from history.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Search engines, social media, e-commerce, and mobile games all make money by selling advertising. But making ads work in AI search might not be so straight forward. Perplexity, for instance, reportedly pulled back on plans to integrate ads into their AI search engine. And internal documents showed the company made only $20,000 in ad revenue in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Garrett Johnson, professor of marketing at Boston University to get a sense of why jumping into the ad business is difficult.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Official response to lawsuit filed by victims’ relatives admits FAA and army failures played role in Washington DC crash</p>
<p>The US government admitted on Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration and the army played a role in causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/aircraft-crash-ronald-reagan-airport-virginia">the collision in January</a> between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter near the nation’s capital, killing 67 people in the deadliest crash on American soil in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The official response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims’ families said that the government is liable in the crash partly because the air traffic controller violated procedures about when to rely on pilots to maintain visual separation that night. Plus, the filing said, the army helicopter pilots’ “failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid” the airline jet makes the government liable.</p>
