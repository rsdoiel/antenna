      <h1>What's in a framework?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>The fashion world has the Met Gala. The movies have the Oscars. Central banking has an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech, where economists will be listening for clues on interest rates. But there’s another pressing issue looming over Powell’s speech: a new five-year framework for the Fed's interest rate strategy. We have an explainer. Plus, there's new evidence that first-time homebuyers remain undeterred.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A trade agreement between the United States and the European Union means that U.S. tariffs on imported European goods will be significantly lower than previously thought. The U.S. will cap tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors at 15%. That's a huge decrease from prior threats of levies as high as 250%. Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>

      <p>Rising unemployment claims will be on Fed Chair Jay Powell's mind when he addresses the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, and as he contemplates an interest rate decision in September. But he’s also got stable prices amid tariff uncertainty to worry about. So, we wonder: What Will Jay Powell Do?

Plus, a weakening labor market sets the backdrop for the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference, and Microsoft's AI chief voices concerns about "AI psychosis."</p>

      <p>The prestigious Santa Fe Indian Market draws over 1,000 Indigenous artists from more than 200 tribal nations each year, including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis artists from Canada. But this year, economic policies from the Trump administration have complicated things for those traveling from north of the border. We'll chat with a few artists. Also on the show: India and China will restart direct flights, and mortgage rates dip, but not enough to boost demand.</p>

      <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel. The arrangement would be unusual but not unprecedented. And Intel was already getting a federal grant under the CHIPS and Science Act, approved during the Biden administration. Also on the show: a dispatch from the annual World AI Conference in Shanghai and a look at the pluses and minuses of retailers using third-party vendors.</p>

      <p>In this uncertain economy, employers want to save where they can. That’s likely why Starbucks just joined a growing list of companies to shift from merit-based raises to a flat percentage raise. In this episode, why a flat raise structure tends to be cheaper and less time consuming than merit increases — even though everyone gets ‘em. Plus: China leans into trade with developing nations, President Trump wants to cut funding for flights to rural airports, and homebuilder sentiment stays low.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>

      <p>It’s a big week for Fed watchers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at a research conference on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It comes at a tricky time for the Fed — pressures are weighing on both price stability and maximum employment, and there's ire coming from President Donald Trump. We'll discuss what to expect. Plus, global demand for cassava is growing. Can Nigeria capitalize on the moment and become an export giant?</p>

      <p>Consumer spending was up pretty significantly for more expensive items last month — things like cars and furniture. All that big-ticket buying comes despite a softening labor market and broader economic uncertainty. We'll parse the data a bit more. Also on the program: we'll hear what we can expect from homebuilder confidence and learn how the startup world is grappling with tariffs and the cancellation of government grants and contracts.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A court in Australia has handed the airline Qantas a record fine — just under $59 million USD — for illegally laying off 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. And later, could plans for sweeping tax cuts on consumer goods boost India’s economy in the face of U.S. tariffs? Plus, the root vegetable cassava is one of the world's most versatile crops. We'll hear more about Nigeria's cassava market.</p>

      <p>
      Electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation.  That's especially costly during the dog days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.  In addition to hot weather, a variety of factors are causing power bills to climb, including the high cost of natural gas used to generate electricity and soaring demand from data centers.

All over TikTok, tons of people have posted videos of how little they got for… $20. $40. $100. Most upsetting to us: an $8 box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br><br>Food prices are almost 30% higher than they were five years ago. It’s bad. And those new, higher prices aren’t going away.<br><br>At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down. And yet, our fears or feelings that things will spiral out of control again? Those have not slowed down.<br><br>This mismatch has been giving us all the... feelings. Inflation feelings. Infeelings. <br><br>On our latest show: we sort through our infeeltions. We talk to the economists who have studied us. We learn why our personal inflation calculators don’t always match the professional ones.<br><br><em>Listen free at these links: </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"target="_blank"   ><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://n.pr/3gTkQlR"target="_blank"   ><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://n.pr/3Bkb17W"target="_blank"   ><em>the NPR app</em></a><em> or anywhere you get podcasts.</em><br><br><em>Find more Planet Money: </em><a href="https://n.pr/3h92GwS"target="_blank"   ><em>Facebook</em></a><em> / </em><a href="https://n.pr/3FqLuws"target="_blank"   ><em>Instagram</em></a><em> / </em><a href="https://n.pr/3sGZdrq"target="_blank"   ><em>TikTok</em></a><em> / Our weekly </em><a href="https://n.pr/3zrFvUB"target="_blank"   ><em>Newsletter</em></a><em>.</em><br><br><em>Support Planet Money, get bonus episodes and sponsor-free listening and now Summer School episodes one week early by subscribing to Planet Money+ </em><a href="http://n.pr/PM-digital"target="_blank"   ><em>in Apple Podcasts</em></a><em> or at </em><a href="https://n.pr/3HlREPz"target="_blank"   ><em>plus.npr.org/planetmoney</em></a><em>.</em>

      <p>
      <p>President Trump reportedly has floated a plan that would have the U.S. government take partial control of Intel, the ailing chipmaking giant. We look at how a potential deal might shake out and what obstacles it could face. Then, on the other side of the Pacific, workers at Chinese AI companies are working long hours in the heated global AI race. And finally, the BBC’s Jane Chambers reports on the economic malaise in Bolivia that’s shaping this weekend’s elections. </p>

But it's not just about the sport; the event is also designed to attract investment. Then, as Bolivia heads to the polls this weekend, an economic crisis is front and centre in voters’ minds. And later, UN talks on a global plastics treaty have ended without a deal.<br></p>
