The federal government is seeking a legal remedy for Google’s monopoly

include a breakup of its parent company, Alphabet. But when similar

<h2 id="pentagon-sends-bomber-aircraft-warships-to-middle-east">Pentagon
sends bomber aircraft, warships to Middle East</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is sending additional
bomber aircraft and Navy warships to the Middle East to bolster the U.S.
presence in the region as an aircraft carrier and its warships are
preparing to leave, U.S. officials said Friday. </p>
<p>Austin ordered several B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft, tanker
aircraft and Navy destroyers to deploy to the Middle East, according to
four U.S. and military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
to discuss troop movements. </p>
<p>The military moves come as Israel’s wars with Hamas in Gaza and
Hezbollah in Lebanon rage, including a retaliatory strike on Iran a week
ago that likely damaged a base that builds ballistic missiles and
launches rockets as part of Tehran’s space program. </p>
<p>The U.S. is pressing for cease-fires, while repeatedly saying it will
defend Israel and continue to protect the American and allied presence
in the region, including from Yemen-based Houthi attacks against ships
in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>The long-range nuclear-capable B-52 bomber has been repeatedly
deployed to the Middle East in pointed warnings to Iran and it is the
second time this month that strategic U.S. bombers will be used to
bolster U.S. defenses in the region. </p>
<p>In October, B-2 stealth bombers were used to strike underground
Houthi targets in Yemen. </p>
<p>Officials did not provide the number of aircraft and ships that will
move into the region. The shifts are likely to result in an overall
decrease in the total number of U.S. service members in the region,
largely because an aircraft carrier contains as many as 5,000
sailors. </p>
<p>But the addition of bomber aircraft beefs up U.S. combat strength.
There have been as many as 43,000 U.S. forces in the region
recently. </p>
<p>According to a U.S. official, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier and the three Navy destroyers in its strike group are scheduled
to leave the Middle East by midmonth and return to their home port in
San Diego. </p>
<p>When it departs, there will be no aircraft carrier in the Middle East
for a period of time, the official said. Officials declined to say how
long that gap would last. </p>
<p>Military commanders have long argued that the presence of an aircraft
carrier strike group, with its array of fighter jets, surveillance
aircraft and heavily armed warships, is a significant deterrent,
including against Iran. </p>
<p>To make up for that gap, Austin is ordering the deployment of other
Navy destroyers to the region. Those destroyers, which are capable of
shooting down ballistic missiles, would come either from the
Indo-Pacific region or Europe, the official said. </p>
<p>Eventually, it is expected that the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft
carrier and its three warships will move to the Mediterranean Sea, but
they won’t get there before the Lincoln departs. The Truman strike group
has been in the North Sea, participating in a NATO military
exercise. </p>
<p>The Lincoln and two of its destroyers are now in the Gulf of Oman,
and its third destroyer is with two other warships in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>There are also two destroyers and the Marine amphibious ready group —
which includes three ships — in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<h2 id="new-york-subway-chokehold-death-trial-begins">New York subway
chokehold death trial begins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A New York prosecutor told jurors on Friday that the way veteran
Daniel Penny defused an uncomfortable situation on the subway by using a
chokehold “went way too far.”</p>
<p>Prosecutor Dafna Yoran said Penny, a white Marine veteran, continued
to hold his arm around the neck of Jordan Neely, a homeless Black man
who had been acting erratically, after Neely’s body went limp.</p>
<p>When the train stopped at a station, one rider told Penny, “If you
don’t let him go now, you’re going to kill him,” Yoran told the jury in
her opening statement Friday. Penny has been charged with manslaughter
and criminally negligent homicide. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he
was acting in self-defense.</p>
<p>“Deadly physical force is permitted only when it’s absolutely
necessary and only for as long as it’s absolutely necessary,” Yoran
said. Penny “went quite literally for the jugular,” she added.</p>
<p>The deadly encounter happened more than one year ago and received
wide news coverage at the time, with some people casting Penny as a hero
and others casting Neely as a victim of a vigilante.</p>
<p>Neely, whom Yoran said was homeless and suffering with mental
illness, entered the subway train on May 1, 2023, threw his coat to the
ground and told the riders he was hungry, thirsty and wanted to return
to jail. His erratic behavior is something that New Yorkers can witness
daily.</p>
<p>“His voice was loud and his words were threatening,” Yoran said, but
Neely was also unarmed and did not physically threaten any of the
riders.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds after Neely entered the train, the prosecutor said,
Penny placed Neely in a chokehold. Yoran said Penny held Neely in the
chokehold for about six minutes.</p>
<p>Video of the incident, Yoran said, would show “how unnecessary this
deadly chokehold was.” There is cellphone video of the incident,
recorded from the subway platform.</p>
<p>The prosecutor also said that Penny, who has first aid training, did
not try to revive Neeley.</p>
<p>Penny later told police, “I put him out” and said that he was trying
to “de-escalate” the scene on the subway.</p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, Neeley was a Michael Jackson
impersonator who sometimes performed his act for subway riders. His
mental illness and drug abuse, AP said, was likely triggered by his
mother’s murder when he was a teenager.</p>
<p>Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press
and Reuters.</p>

id="covid-19-shots-banned-at-public-health-district-in-idaho-likely-first-in-us">COVID-19
shots banned at public health district in Idaho, likely first in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing
COVID-19 vaccinations to residents in six counties after a narrow
decision by its board.</p>
<p>Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be
restricted from giving COVID-19 shots. Vaccinations are an essential
function of a public health department.</p>
<p>While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting
COVID-19 vaccines and Florida’s surgeon general bucked medical consensus
to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country
haven’t blocked the vaccines outright.</p>
<p>“I’m not aware of anything else like this,” said Adriane Casalotti,
chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of
County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have
stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not
based on “a judgment of the medical product itself.”</p>
<p>The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three
counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines in
the health district has declined — with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far
in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest
childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the
Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles
outbreak that sickened 10.</p>
<p>On Oct. 22, the health department’s board voted 4-3 in favor of the
ban — despite Southwest’s medical director testifying to the vaccine’s
necessity.</p>
<p>“Our request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer
those [vaccines], recognizing that we always have these discussions of
risks and benefits,” Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. “This is not
a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful
approach.”</p>
<p>Opposite Jansen’s plea were more than 290 public comments, many of
which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the
vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the
meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the
rounds to testify against COVID-19 vaccines, including Dr. Peter
McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells “contagion emergency kits”
that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine — drugs that have not
been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.</p>
<p>Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices
who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic
measures.</p>
<p>Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he’s skeptical of
COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the
meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but
“disappointed” in the board’s decision.</p>
<p>He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients
and their doctors — and possibly opened a door to blocking other
vaccines or treatments.</p>
<p>Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get
vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to
signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get
vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite
evidence that they’re safe and have saved millions of lives.)</p>
<p>The people getting vaccinated at the health department — including
people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term
care facilities or in the immigration process — had no other options,
Jansen and Aberasturi said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it
can be when you’re … trying to get by and get ahead,” Aberasturi said.
“This is where we should be stepping in and helping.</p>
<p>“But we have some board members who have never been there, so they
don’t understand what it’s like.”</p>
<p>State health officials have said that they “recommend that people
consider the COVID-19 vaccine.” Idaho health department spokesperson AJ
McWhorter declined to comment on “public health district business,” but
noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health
centers for people who are uninsured.</p>
<p>Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the
health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients
and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is
supposed to be caring for the “health and well-being” of the district’s
residents. “But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn’t
do that due diligence.”</p>

id="before-us-sanctions-violations-arrest-russian-businessman-faced-charge-in-hong-kong">Before
US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charge in Hong
Kong</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three
companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another
move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme
to violate sanctions.</p>
<p>A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested
the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida.</p>
<p>He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit
smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network
of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the
United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones
used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export
controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the
United States.</p>
<p>Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced
together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international
trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida
real estate.</p>
<p>Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he
could face decades in prison.</p>
<p>Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for
comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When
VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond
to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app.</p>
<p>According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was
transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington.</p>
<p>American charges</p>
<p>After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24,
2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of
microelectronics to Russia.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed
co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in
Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions.</p>
<p>It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the
goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and
Estonia.</p>
<p>“As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology
he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal
activity,” U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release.
“Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland
Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the
plot.”</p>
<p>The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian
company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the
indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company
was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023.</p>
<p>An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that
Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export
restrictions.</p>
<p>Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice
included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company
Radius Avtomatika.</p>
<p>Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly
exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states
that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s
military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Hong Kong story</p>
<p>Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong
since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea —
and their three children.</p>
<p>Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting
goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to
Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions,
some of this activity became illegal.</p>
<p>When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of
his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside
from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in
Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK
Limited.</p>
<p>All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited.</p>
<p>Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from
Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces
the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple
screens.</p>
<p>Just a day after Postovoy’s arrest was announced, Cubios publicly
denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited.</p>
<p>“Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or
employees … have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not
own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,” the
company said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>The startup also said that Postovoy “falsely listed himself as a VP
of the Company” on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for
production, according to archived versions of its website.</p>
<p>Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced
him to Postovoy.</p>
<p>“I was looking for someone who could help with production in China —
they gave me Denis,” he wrote in a message to VOA.</p>
<p>According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made
important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube.
Later the company decreased cooperation with him.</p>
<p>Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed
him to call himself the vice president of production “for business
purposes,” Osipov told VOA.</p>
<p>He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’
permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in
Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said.</p>
<p>Coming to America</p>
<p>In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where
Cubios’ headquarters is.</p>
<p>According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire
to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly
strict Chinese control of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>American prosecutors see a different motivation.</p>
<p>In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case
materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022,
with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison
and a fine of up to $643,000.</p>
<p>According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on
March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before.</p>
<p>Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>By June 2022, Postovoy’s wife purchased a house in southeastern
Sarasota.</p>
<p>Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at
around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes
gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost
$1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by
his wife.</p>
<p>On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and
later sold the property.</p>
<p>According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy’s decision to transfer
the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his
ownership.</p>
<p>He “did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million
dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his
financial affidavit submitted to this Court,” the judge wrote in a
decision not to grant Postovoy bail.</p>
<p>This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian
company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry
Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company.</p>

id="recent-us-strikes-spotlight-growing-islamic-state-threat-in-syria">Recent
US strikes spotlight growing Islamic State threat in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Airstrikes carried out by the U.S. military this week
against several Islamic State targets in Syria highlight concerns about
the terror group’s growing presence in the war-torn country, experts
say.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, said Wednesday that its forces had
conducted strikes on Monday targeting multiple camps belonging to IS, or
ISIS, in the Syrian desert. Nearly 35 IS operatives, including senior
leaders, were killed in the airstrikes, the U.S. military said.</p>
<p>Despite its territorial defeat in 2019, IS has been carrying out
attacks through sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria. In recent months,
militants affiliated with the group have increasingly become active in
areas controlled by forces loyal to the government of Syrian President
Bashar Assad and their Iranian and Russian allies.</p>
<p>The Syrian Desert, also known as the Badia, where the U.S. forces
struck IS positions this week, has seen a significant surge in violence
by IS militants in recent months.</p>
<p>IS had maintained training camps in the Syrian desert for many years,
according to Gregory Waters, a research analyst at the Counter Extremism
Project who closely follows IS activities in central Syria.</p>
<p>“These are the places where it trains the next generation of fighters
— often children it recruits from northeast Syria — and where adult
fighters can return to in between their operations,” Waters told VOA.
“While the central Syrian desert is under Russian and Syrian regime
control, ISIS does not abide by these arbitrary lines.”</p>
<p>He added that IS cells in the central desert support the cells
operating in northeast Syria, which is largely under the control of
U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.</p>
<p>The United States has about 900 troops in northeast Syria as part of
a global coalition against IS.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes the fighters will cross from one region to the other to
either conduct attacks or to escape from counter-ISIS operations,”
Waters said.</p>
<p>Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, said the U.S.
strikes demonstrate that the terror group remains a significant threat
in Syria.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the Assad regime lacks either the will or the capability
to counter ISIS, so the United States has remained vigilant in its
efforts to keep the group on the defensive,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>“Any time you have a terrorist group with the legacy of the Islamic
State, with a proven track record of being able to recruit, plan and
conduct attacks, including external operations in the West, it is never
a good idea to become complacent,” Clarke said. “The strikes are
necessary to keep ISIS from regrouping, whether in Syria or the
hinterlands of Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Abdul Wahab Assi, a researcher at the Istanbul-based Jusoor Center
for Studies, said the U.S. strikes in the Syrian Desert carried a
political message, as well.</p>
<p>“It sent a message to Russia, which ostensibly operates against IS in
that particular area, that it’s not doing enough” to counter IS
activities in Syria, he told Syria TV, a news channel affiliated with
the Syrian opposition.</p>
<p>Last week, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced the
killing of the IS leader in Iraq and eight other senior IS commanders in
a joint operation by U.S. and Iraqi forces.</p>
<p>CENTCOM said in its Wednesday statement that alongside its allies and
partners in the region, it “will continue to aggressively degrade ISIS
operational capabilities to ensure its enduring defeat.”</p>

<h2 id="elon-musk-loses-bid-to-move-1-million-voter-prizes-case">Elon
Musk loses bid to move $1 million voter prizes case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk’s bid to move a Pennsylvania
lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the
case back to state court.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the
billionaire’s plan to keep awarding money until the U.S. presidential
election Tuesday.</p>
<p>The decision was issued by U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in
Philadelphia federal court.</p>
<p>Musk has been giving $1 million checks to randomly selected
registered voters who sign a petition supporting free speech and gun
rights.</p>
<p>Musk’s America PAC had awarded $1 million prizes to 14 people as of
Friday and said the final prize will be given out Tuesday.</p>
<p>Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk
and his political action committee, which backs Republican former
President Donald Trump, on Monday in a state court to try to block the
giveaway. Krasner called the program an illegal lottery.</p>
<p>Two days later, Tesla CEO Musk and his America PAC sought to move the
case to federal court, arguing Krasner’s lawsuit raised questions about
free-speech rights and election interference that belong in federal
court. That prompted the state judge who had been overseeing the case to
put it on hold.</p>
<p>In arguing that the case belonged in state court, Krasner called
Musk’s maneuver an attempt to “run the clock until Election Day.”
Krasner did not allege the giveaway violates federal law.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of seven
battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the race between
Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Musk’s offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states
expected to decide the election — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Musk gave away the first $1 million at an October 19 America PAC
rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania’s state capital.</p>
<p>The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts
are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against
paying people to register to vote.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice warned America PAC the giveaway could
violate federal law, according to media reports, but federal prosecutors
have not taken any public action.</p>
<p>Musk has so far given nearly $120 million to America PAC, according
to federal disclosures.</p>

<h2 id="what-us-election-results-could-mean-for-africa">What US election
results could mean for Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — Whoever U.S. voters choose as their next president —
former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris — the
election has global implications, with the probability it will affect
other economies, foreign conflicts and personal freedoms, analysts told
VOA.</p>
<p>South African independent political analyst Asanda Ngoasheng said the
winner could usher in policies that affect ordinary people in
Africa.</p>
<p>“I hope that as Americans vote, they’re aware that whatever decision
they make, it’s going to determine the future of not only America but
the rest of the world,” she said.</p>
<p>“How we engage with issues of termination of pregnancy, how we engage
with issues of LGBT rights, how we engage with issues of race and racism
will be determined by this election, not just for America but for
everyone else and everywhere else in the world,” Ngoasheng
continued.</p>
<p>The abortion issue is a particularly divisive topic for U.S.
Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>While the United States is the largest funder of global reproductive
health programs, Trump slashed that funding during his presidency by
extending a policy that barred U.S. aid from going to any organization
that supported abortion.</p>
<p>Experts said they believe that a second Trump presidency would likely
do that again and could negatively affect PEPFAR, the U.S.’s key
HIV/AIDS program.</p>
<p>Trade is another key area in which analysts think Harris and Trump
would differ, given Trump’s “America first” policy.</p>
<p>African governments hope that next year the U.S. will renew the
African Growth and Opportunity Act, a Clinton-era policy that gives
countries duty-free access to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Ray Hartley, research director of South African Brenthurst Foundation
think tank, does not have high hopes for a second Trump presidency.</p>
<p>“I think that a Trump presidency would reinforce America’s
isolationist approach in international affairs, and that might not be
good for trade,” he said.</p>
<p>Other analysts said they believe general U.S. policy toward Africa
won’t differ radically regardless of who wins.</p>
<p>They said that while Africa was often neglected in terms of U.S.
foreign policy, that has shifted in recent years amid renewed
competition with Russia and China on the resource-rich continent.</p>
<p>Moscow has strengthened military ties with many African governments,
while U.S. troops have been kicked out of Niger and Chad. Beijing,
meanwhile, is Africa’s largest trade partner and has been building
infrastructure throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Ebenezer Obadare, senior fellow for Africa studies at U.S. research
organization  Council on Foreign Relations, said, “Insofar as the United
States is intent on competing with those powers in Africa, keeping its
old alliances and building new ones, I don’t think one administration is
likely to differ much from another, strictly in terms of their Africa
policy.”</p>
<p>As vice president, Harris traveled to the continent, where she pushed
President Joe Biden’s line that the U.S. was “all in on Africa.” The
Biden administration also started holding an annual U.S.-African
leaders’ summit.</p>
<p>And, as it increases competition with China, the current
administration has also undertaken funding the biggest U.S.
infrastructure project in Africa in generations: the Lobito corridor, a
railway connecting Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo that will
be used to transport critical minerals.</p>
<p>Biden was forced to reschedule a promised visit to Africa and is now
expected in Angola in December. The choice of country has been
criticized by some for what they say is Angola’s shoddy human rights
record.</p>
<p>Trump’s signature initiative involving the continent was creating
Prosper Africa, a U.S. agency designed to assist American companies
doing business in Africa.</p>
<p>However, he also offended many Africans during his first term, using
a derogatory term to refer to countries on the continent and
mispronouncing Namibia’s name. More recently he raised ire by comparing
himself to South African icon Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while Harris and Trump have generally ignored
Africa over the course of their campaigns, whoever becomes America’s
next president would do well to keep up engagement with the continent,
which boasts the world’s youngest population.</p>

<h2 id="trump-visits-dearborn-michigan-capital-of-arab-america">Trump
visits Dearborn, Michigan, ‘capital’ of Arab America</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In the run-up to the presidential election, U.S. Vice
President Kamala Harris’ campaign has increased its outreach to Arab and
Muslim Americans, particularly in battleground state Michigan. But it is
her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, who has made
surprising gains with this group that makes up a significant portion of
voters angry about President Joe Biden’s policies on the Israel-Hamas
war in Gaza.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump visited a cafe in Dearborn, Michigan, a city dubbed
the Arab capital of America, in a state home to almost 400,000 Arab
Americans. Many of them have expressed determination to punish Harris
over the Biden administration’s support for Israel.</p>
<p>“We have a great feeling for Lebanon, and I know so many people from
Lebanon, the Lebanese people,” Trump said in response to a reporter
asking him for the reason of his visit. “The Muslim population, they’re
liking Trump, and I’ve had a good relationship with them. This is it.
This is where they are, Dearborn. But we want their votes, and we’re
looking for their votes, and I think we’ll get their votes.”</p>
<p>Trump’s visit is a continuation of his outreach to the Arab and
Muslim community that has resulted in endorsements from leaders of two
nearby Michigan cities that, while tiny, carry symbolic importance. Bill
Bazzi, the first Muslim and Arab American mayor of Dearborn Heights, and
Amer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, the only U.S. city
with an all-Muslim city council, have both endorsed the Republican
candidate.</p>
<p>“My meeting with President Trump was positive, and we hope that he
can change the current situation,” Ghalib told VOA. “He said he doesn’t
want wars, and he will listen to our concerns.”</p>
<p>Three of the six members of the Hamtramck City Council followed
Ghalib’s endorsement and the rest endorsed Harris — a split that
reflects the community’s polarized views of the candidates.</p>
<p>“Harris has answered this question many times that she is going to
work with Gaza. She’s going to be fair with people of Gaza,” council
member Mohammed Alsomiri told VOA. “Trump, I don’t believe him, and I
don’t trust him.”</p>
<p>Imam endorses Trump</p>
<p>The former president has been courting the group intensively. At a
rally last week in the Detroit suburb of Novi, about a half hour drive
from Dearborn, he said Muslim and Arab voters “want a stop to the
endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they
want.”</p>
<p>Trump was joined onstage by what his campaign described as “prominent
leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,” including Imam Belal Alzuhairi
of the Great Mosque of Hamtramck.</p>
<p>“We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises
peace, not war!” said Alzuhairi.</p>
<p>This despite Trump suggesting that he would give Israel’s military
offensives against Hamas and Hezbollah more leeway, telling Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recent call to “do what you have to
do.” He often boasts he will end the wars in the Middle East “in 24
hours,” without explaining how.</p>
<p>As president, Trump in 2017 called for a “total and complete
shutdown” on Muslims, banning individuals from six Muslim-majority
countries from entering, a policy that activists said was “cruel,
inhumane, and violated international law.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has not responded to VOA’s queries on outreach to
the community.</p>
<p>Harris’ outreach</p>
<p>On the anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, 25
Muslim leaders released an open letter telling Muslim voters that
backing Harris “far outweighs the harms of the other options.”</p>
<p>The Harris campaign says it has been “working hard” to engage the
community. The vice president met with a small group of leaders in
Detroit, Michigan, in August, shortly after she became the Democratic
nominee, and with leaders in Flint, Michigan, in early October. She has
had one other meeting since then with Black imams and community leaders
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, another key swing state.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign said it is “working hard” to engage the
community. The vice president met twice with a small group of leaders in
Michigan, in Detroit in August shortly after she became the Democratic
nominee and in Flint in early October. She has had one other meeting
since then, with Black imams and community leaders in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, another key swing state.</p>
<p>Afghan American Nasrina Bargzie and Egyptian American Brenda Abdelal,
two lawyers spearheading Muslim and Arab outreach for the Harris
campaign, have met with groups in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Minnesota, Arizona and Nevada, the Harris
campaign told VOA. Phil Gordon, Harris’ national security adviser, met
virtually in early October with leaders across the country, the campaign
said.</p>
<p>But many of these meetings have been with friendlier groups,
suggesting that they were not aimed at changing hearts and minds.
Gordon’s meeting excluded major Muslim and Arab organizations as well as
pro-Palestinian activist groups and was more of a “check the box”
engagement, according to James Zogby, president of the Arab American
Institute, who participated in the eight-person meeting.</p>
<p>Governor Tim Walz, Harris’ vice presidential pick, has had one
engagement with Arab and Muslim Americans, an October virtual meeting
with Emgage Action, the political arm of an 18-year-old Muslim American
advocacy group, which already endorsed the Democratic presidential
candidate in September.</p>
<p>Third-party candidates</p>
<p>While polls suggest Arab Americans’ and Muslim Americans’ support for
Trump is unlikely to surpass their support of Harris’— they also show
that third-party candidates could pull a significant portion of votes
from her. In Michigan, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has been
campaigning on a platform to “end the genocide.”</p>
<p>A poll released Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations,
or CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy organization, showed that
29.4% of American Muslims plan to vote for Harris, 29.1% for Stein, and
11.2% for Trump. More than 16% remain undecided.</p>
<p>The numbers suggest an improvement for Harris and Trump among the
group. Before Biden’s withdrawal, CAIR’s poll showed Biden received 7.3%
support and Trump 4.9%.</p>
<p>Compared to Biden, Harris has been more vocal in expressing sympathy
for Palestinians and calling out Israel to “follow humanitarian law.”
She has also addressed the suffering in Lebanon and announced $157
million in assistance from the administration.</p>
<p>At a Harris rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this week, Assad Turfe, an
Arab American official from nearby Wayne County, said that Harris is a
leader “who will give voice to our pain.”</p>
<p>But in that rally, Harris was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters,
as she has been in other campaign events.</p>
<p>“Hey, guys, I hear you,” she said. “We all want this war to end as
soon as possible.”</p>
<p>A candidate must secure a minimum of 270 out of 538 Electoral College
votes to win. With 16 Electoral College votes, Michigan could tip the
balance in what is expected to be a close election. Biden won the state
in 2020 by 154,000 votes. In 2016, Trump won the state over Hillary
Clinton by just under 11,000 votes.</p>
<p>The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has been a divisive issue among the
community. At a Dearborn news conference announcing Arab American
leaders’ endorsement for Harris earlier this week, a group of
anti-Harris Arab Americans confronted them, calling them traitors.</p>
<p>Ronald Stockton, a professor emeritus at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn who has studied the community for decades, said he had
never seen such polarization.</p>
<p>“There will be permanent scars left behind,” Stockton told VOA. “Like
battlefield scars that remain decades after the war ends.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Iram Abbasi contributed to this report.</p>

and enemies</u></a> could all come down to the whims of the state’s 8.9
million registered voters.
</p>
<p>
But Pennsylvanians have other important choices to make on their
ballots, too. “Pennsylvania is a major energy state, and its decisions —
regardless of what type of energy it is — have a huge impact on
America’s energy portfolio,” John Qua, the campaign manager of Lead
Locally, which is supporting

producer after Wyoming and West Virginia, Pennsylvania also holds the
distinction of being the fifth-largest greenhouse gas-emitting state in
the nation. Its state legislature hasn’t passed new climate legislation
since 2008, in large part because of the influence of the fossil fuel
industry over local politics. The American Petroleum Institute donates

around 100,000 people</u></a> — more than made the difference in
deciding the 2020 election in the state. (Harris notably reneged on her
2019 pledge
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/harris-campaign-pennsylvania-fracking" target="_self"><u>to
ban fracking</u></a> if elected in an apparent overture to
Pennsylvanians, although the state’s imperiled Democratic senator, Bob
Casey,
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11082024/pennsylvania-senate-race-dave-mccormick-bob-casey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been hammered</u></a> by his Republican challenger over her prior
position.)
</p>
<p>
Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, until at least
2026, and Democrats hold slim control over the state House of
Representatives by a margin of 102 to 101. The ambition this cycle is to
keep the state House <em><em>and</em></em> flip the Republican-held
state Senate. Picking up three seats there would earn Democrats a
governing trifecta, with a tie-breaking vote going to Democratic Lt. Gov
Austin Davis. Flip four seats, and they’d have the majority.
</p>
<p>
But “if you asked me to bet you $10 that the Democrats would win, I
wouldn’t take the bet,” David Masur, the executive director of
PennEnvironment, a green research and advocacy group that works in the
state, told me. “I think it’s just a long shot.”
</p>
<p>
The path to winning the state Senate and achieving a governing trifecta
clearly runs through three districts. The first and easiest pickup is in
SD-15, around the state capital in Harrisburg, where the “map is much
friendlier to Democrats,” according to Masur. The party would then need
to win a competitive seat in SD-37, in the Pittsburgh suburbs, which has
tilted blue recently and also seems theoretically within reach. But
things get trickier in SD-49, Democrats’
“<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/02/pennsylvania-state-senate-elections-2024-democratic-majority-flip-republican/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white
whale</u></a>” district in Erie County, which President Biden won by 2
points but where Republican senator Dan Laughlin remains well-liked. To
wrest back the chamber, in other words, the Democrats would “have to run
the table,” Masur said. “I don’t even think there’s another race where
you could go, ‘Oh, they could get the majority by winning this other
seat.’ There’s nowhere else to go. They have to win those three.”
</p>
<p>
Because of recent redistricting, the climate groups working in the state
are cautious about getting their hopes up too high. “Flipping the
[state] Senate, which is currently held by Republicans, might be a
two-cycle endeavor with these new maps,” Lead Locally’s Qua said. This
doesn’t necessarily mean all is lost: Even maintaining control of two of
the three levers of government in Pennsylvania would be a victory, and
Democrats this summer managed to garner enough bipartisan support to
<a href="https://www.pahouse.com/Fiedler/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=134824" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pass
legislation</u></a> to bring solar panels to state schools.
</p>
<p>
But the stakes — and promises — of a trifecta feel crucial and
tantalizingly close. According to
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25102024/pennsylvania-renewable-energy-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
recent analysis</u></a> by PennEnvironment, Pennsylvania is 48th in the
nation for the percentage growth of total solar, wind, and geothermal in
the past decade, and 46th in the nation for the percentage of growth in
total solar over the past five years, generating less than its neighbors
New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio. “The fossil fuel industry is extremely
moneyed and extremely influential, and it’s created a political reality
where it’s very difficult to move good climate and clean energy policy
forward in Harrisburg,” Flora Cardoni, PennEnvironment’s deputy
director, told me. Climate obstructionists in the state Senate often
refuse to call up good environmental policies for votes, leaving the
state with “no laws on the books that require utility companies in
Pennsylvania to increase the amount of clean renewable energy that they
provide to their customers” which is “a huge impediment to progress.”
</p>
<p>
It’s not as if Democrats aren’t ready to go — they are. Shapiro is
sitting on a two-bill plan for tackling climate change in the state. One
would boost renewable energy to 35% of Pennsylvania’s total generation
by 2035, which Cardoni described as “a huge step in the right direction,
although we need to do much more.” The second bill would make polluters
pay for their carbon emissions and spend the resulting money on clean
air, water, and energy efficiency projects — essentially, a
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-pennsylvania-shapiro-renewable-energy-electricity-bdb66ee44ccf3fe0113064da698aa657" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backup</u></a>
plan for if the state’s attempt to join
<a href="https://foleyhoag.com/news-and-insights/blogs/law-and-the-environment/2024/march/update-on-rggi-in-pennsylvania/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</u></a> fails. (Owing to a question
of constitutionality, RGGI is in limbo with the state’s Supreme Court.)
</p>
<p>
So, in a sense, you <em><em>have</em></em> to go for it. “Yeah, they’re
really hard races,” admitted Caroline Spears, the executive director of
Climate Cabinet, which is
<a href="https://climatecabinet.org/candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporting
26 candidates</u></a> in the state. “But if you win,” she added, “you
win the fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the country.” While she
was loath to “compare our states against each other,” Spears pointed out
that Pennsylvania’s emissions are about two and a half times those of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/arizona-climate-elections" target="_self"><u>Arizona</u></a>,
which makes it a much bigger opportunity for reductions.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important point: No one really <em><em>knows</em></em>
what’s going to happen. Not only are organizers working with new maps in
the state
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/pennsylvania/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due
to 2022 redistricting</u></a>, but state-level races also rarely attract
substantial enough polling to make reliably predictive guesses,
especially when there are so many toss-ups and razor-thin margins.
Adding to the trickiness, Pennsylvania is one of the few states where
residents still appear willing to split their tickets; in 2020,
ticket-splitting between the president and the state Legislature was up
to 15 points in places, which is part of why Climate Cabinet has
targeted races in the state with margins of up to 10 points that other
groups wouldn’t touch. “Folks have been like, ‘the Pennsylvania Senate’s
not doable.’ That’s the word on the street,” Spears told me. “But I
think people are forgetting a little bit that that was also the word on
the street about the Minnesota Senate and the Michigan legislature,”
which flipped during the 2022 midterms.
</p>
<p>
What’s encouraging is that Pennsylvania voters — contrary to their image
of being fracking obsessives — have been
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/can-energy-rich-pennsylvania-chart-a-path-towards-decarbonization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>curious
or even enthusiastic</u></a> about pivoting to clean energy when
organizers have spoken with them. Following
<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/uncategorized/a-year-after-devastating-winter-storm-power-plant-problems-still-likely-in-extreme-weather/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Winter
Storm Elliott in 2022</u></a>, which caused outages across the state,
many residents now “recognize that the grid is outdated,” Julia Kortrey,
the deputy state policy director at Evergreen Action, a national climate
advocacy group, told me. There’s an acknowledgment among many that “the
status quo is not working.”
</p>
<p>
As in many parts of the country this year, local races in Pennsylvania
are mainly focused on battles over education, abortion access,
immigration, and crime, not necessarily clean energy. But often,
climate-related issues are bubbling just under the surface. “I’m not
going to go up to someone’s door and ask ‘What issue is on your mind
today?’ and have them say, ‘I’m really worried about the PM2.5
concentration or the Mauna Loa CO2 readings,’” Spears told me. “But if
they’re like, ‘The cost of living is too high,’ I’m going to have a
conversation about home insurance.”
</p>
<p>
A particularly good example of this is playing out in one of
Pennsylvania’s U.S. House races, which will help determine the ultimate
makeup of Congress. In the Lehigh Valley, Democratic Representative
Susan Wild is attempting to hold off her Republican challenger, state
Representative Ryan Mackenzie, who voted against the school solar bill
and the state’s clean water act. Wild had been particularly instrumental
in helping to replace lead pipes in the area, and she’s made her
leadership on the issue prominent in her campaigning. “The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and lead pipe removal can seem very — I don’t want to
say <em><em>national</em></em>, but it can be hard to visualize,” Nate
Fowler, the regional campaigns director of the League of Conservation
Voters, told me. “But for voters in this part of the Commonwealth, it’s
easy for them to understand why this is so important.”
</p>
<p>
It won’t be until after the dust from Tuesday settles — when
Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral college votes have been allocated, and its
U.S. House and Senate races decided — that national attention will turn
to the consequences of the state’s down-ballot races, if it ever does.
But whether Democrats run the table or Republicans eat into their
opponents’ grip on the legislature, Pennsylvania’s elections will be
pivotal to the nation’s greater evolving energy story.
</p>
<p>
“So much of what we can accomplish in Pennsylvania will lay the
groundwork for what is accomplished across the country,” Kortrey, of
Evergreen Action, said. “I tell folks, ‘If we can do it in Pennsylvania,
we can do it anywhere.’”

id="before-us-sanctions-violations-arrest-russian-businessman-faced-charges-in-hong-kong">Before
US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charges in
Hong Kong</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three
companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another
move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme
to violate sanctions.</p>
<p>A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested
the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida.</p>
<p>He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit
smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network
of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the
United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones
used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export
controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the
United States.</p>
<p>Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced
together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international
trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida
real estate.</p>
<p>Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he
could face decades in prison.</p>
<p>Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for
comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When
VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond
to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app.</p>
<p>According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was
transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington.</p>
<p>American charges</p>
<p>After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24,
2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of
microelectronics to Russia.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed
co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in
Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions.</p>
<p>It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the
goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and
Estonia.</p>
<p>“As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology
he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal
activity,” U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release.
“Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland
Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the
plot.”</p>
<p>The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian
company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the
indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company
was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023.</p>
<p>An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that
Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export
restrictions.</p>
<p>Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice
included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company
Radius Avtomatika.</p>
<p>Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly
exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states
that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s
military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Hong Kong story</p>
<p>Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong
since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea —
and their three children.</p>
<p>Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting
goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to
Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions,
some of this activity became illegal.</p>
<p>When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of
his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside
from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in
Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK
Limited.</p>
<p>All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited.</p>
<p>Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from
Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces
the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple
screens.</p>
<p>Just a day after Postovoy’s arrest was announced, Cubios publicly
denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited.</p>
<p>“Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or
employees … have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not
own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,” the
company said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>The startup also said that Postovoy “falsely listed himself as a VP
of the Company” on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for
production, according to archived versions of its website.</p>
<p>Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced
him to Postovoy.</p>
<p>“I was looking for someone who could help with production in China —
they gave me Denis,” he wrote in a message to VOA.</p>
<p>According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made
important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube.
Later the company decreased cooperation with him.</p>
<p>Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed
him to call himself the vice president of production “for business
purposes,” Osipov told VOA.</p>
<p>He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’
permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in
Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said.</p>
<p>Coming to America</p>
<p>In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where
Cubios’ headquarters is.</p>
<p>According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire
to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly
strict Chinese control of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>American prosecutors see a different motivation.</p>
<p>In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case
materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022,
with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison
and a fine of up to $643,000.</p>
<p>According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on
March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before.</p>
<p>Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>By June 2022, Postovoy’s wife purchased a house in southeastern
Sarasota.</p>
<p>Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at
around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes
gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost
$1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by
his wife.</p>
<p>On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and
later sold the property.</p>
<p>According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy’s decision to transfer
the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his
ownership.</p>
<p>He “did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million
dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his
financial affidavit submitted to this Court,” the judge wrote in a
decision not to grant Postovoy bail.</p>
<p>This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian
company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry
Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company.</p>

id="us-border-arrests-remained-lower-in-october-amid-biden-asylum-restrictions">US
border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum
restrictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. border authorities apprehended some 54,000 migrants illegally
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary
figures obtained by Reuters, showing a marginal rise from September but
continuing the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions
were imposed under President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate,
has called for even tougher border restrictions in the face of criticism
by Republican candidate Donald Trump over illegal immigration as the two
compete in a tight race. </p>
<p>Immigration is a top issue for voters heading into Tuesday’s
election, particularly among Republicans, and Trump has intensified his
language. </p>
<p>The roughly 54,000 migrant arrests from October 1 through October 30
were far less than the U.S. Border Patrol’s monthly arrest average of
160,000 through the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, before the
Biden restrictions were imposed. The preliminary data reviewed by
Reuters did not include the final day of October. </p>
<p>In fiscal year 2023, border agents apprehended an average of 170,000
migrants per month. </p>
<p>In fiscal year 2019, before the pandemic and during Trump’s
presidency, the monthly average was about 71,000.  </p>
<p>“We feel very confident in the strategy that we’re employing to
manage this,” a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said,
requesting anonymity to discuss unpublished statistics. The official
said the reduced crossings had allowed more agents to move to the field
and target trafficking of people and drugs. </p>
<p>Biden’s restrictions blocked most people crossing illegally from
claiming asylum. At the same time, Mexico stepped up its immigration
enforcement following U.S. pressure. </p>
<p>Trump cracked down on both legal and illegal immigration during his
2017-2021 presidency and has promised historic levels of deportations if
reelected. Harris blames Trump for helping kill bipartisan legislation
earlier this year that aimed to increase border security. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has also launched programs that have allowed
hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally through emergency
“parole,” which Biden officials say has reduced illegal crossings.
Republicans argue the Biden programs exceed the bounds of the law and
serve as a workaround to allow migrants to enter the U.S.</p>

id="us-employers-add-12000-jobs-last-month-as-hurricanes-strikes-reduce-payrolls">US
employers add 12,000 jobs last month as hurricanes, strikes reduce
payrolls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s employers added 12,000 jobs in October, a
total that economists say was held down by the effects of strikes and
hurricanes that left many workers temporarily off payrolls. The report
provided a somewhat blurry view of the job market at the end of a
presidential race that has pivoted heavily on voters’ feelings about the
economy.</p>
<p>Last month’s hiring gain was down significantly from the 223,000 jobs
that were added in September. But economists have estimated that
hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with strikes at Boeing and
elsewhere, had the effect of pushing down net job growth by tens of
thousands of jobs in October.</p>
<p>Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the
unemployment rate remained at 4.1% last month. The low jobless rate
suggests that the labor market is still fundamentally healthy, if not as
robust as it was early this year. Combined with an inflation rate that
has tumbled from its 2022 peak to near prepandemic levels, the overall
economy appears to be on solid footing on the eve of Election Day.</p>
<p>The government did not estimate how many jobs were likely removed
temporarily from payrolls last month. But economists have said they
think the storms and strikes caused up to 100,000 jobs to be dropped.
Reflecting the impact of the strikes, factories shed 46,000 positions in
October.</p>
<p>Health care companies added 52,000 jobs in October, and state and
local governments tacked on 39,000.</p>
<p>The employment report for October also revised down the government’s
estimate of the job gains in August and September by a combined 112,000,
indicating that the labor market wasn’t quite as robust then as
initially thought.</p>
<p>“The big one-off shocks that struck the economy in October make it
impossible to know whether the job market was changing direction in the
month,’’ Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a
commentary. “But the downward revisions to job growth through September
show it was cooling before these shocks struck.’’</p>
<p>Still, economists have noted that the United States has the strongest
of the world’s most advanced economies, one that has proved surprisingly
durable despite the pressure of high interest rates. This week, for
example, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a healthy
2.8% annual rate last quarter, with consumer spending — the heart of the
economy — helping drive growth.</p>
<p>Yet as voters choose between former President Donald Trump and Vice
President Kamala Harris, large numbers of Americans have said they are
unhappy with the state of the economy. Despite the plummeting of
inflation, many people are exasperated by high prices, which surged
during the recovery from the pandemic recession and remain about 20%
higher on average than they were before inflation began accelerating in
early 2021.</p>
<p>With inflation having significantly cooled, the Fed is set to cut its
benchmark interest rate next week for a second time and likely again in
December. The Fed’s 11 rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 managed to help slow
inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. A series of Fed
rate cuts should lead, over time, to lower borrowing rates for consumers
and businesses.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there have been signs of a slowdown in the job
market. This week, the Labor Department reported that employers posted
7.4 million job openings in September. Although that is still more than
employers posted on the eve of the 2020 pandemic, it amounted to the
fewest openings since January 2021.</p>
<p>And 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs in September, the fewest in
more than four years. A drop in quits tends to indicate that more
workers are losing confidence in their ability to land a better job
elsewhere.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Today’s jobs report featured a shockingly small number of new hires with
just around 12,000 jobs added. However, as FHN Financial’s Christopher
Low explains, these dismal figures have more to do with recent extreme
weather events and the ongoing strike at Boeing. Plus, we look at why a

to pass on after death is expiring — and why most people shouldn’t be
concerned about it. And, the BBC’s Mariko Oi highlights the global

envoy sees some ‘concerning signals’ in Russia-China military
cooperation in Arctic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States is watching growing cooperation between Russia and
China in the Arctic closely and some of their recent military
collaboration in the region sends “concerning signals”, the U.S. Arctic
ambassador said.  </p>
<p>Russia and China have stepped up military cooperation in the Arctic
while deepening overall ties in recent years that include China
supplying Moscow with dual-use goods despite Western sanctions on Russia
over the war in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Russia and the United States are among eight countries with territory
in the resource-rich Arctic. China calls itself a “near-Arctic” state
and wants to create a “Polar Silk Road” in the Arctic, a new shipping
route as the polar ice sheet recedes with rising temperatures.  </p>
<p>Michael Sfraga, the United States’ first ambassador-at-large for
Arctic affairs, said the “frequency and the complexity” of recent
military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing in the region sent
“concerning signals”. </p>
<p>“The fact that they are working together in the Arctic has our
attention,” Sfraga, who was sworn in last month, told Reuters in a
telephone interview from Alaska. “We are being both vigilant and
diligent about this. We’re watching very closely this evolution of their
activity.” </p>
<p>“It raises our radar, literally and figuratively,” he added.</p>
<p>Sfraga cited a joint run by Russian and Chinese bomber planes off the
coast of Alaska in July, and Chinese and Russian coast guard ships
sailing together through the Bering Strait in October.  </p>
<p>He said these activities had been conducted in international waters,
in line with international law, but the fact that the bombers flew off
the coast of Alaska had raised concerns for U.S. security. </p>
<p>“We do need to think about security, heighten our own alliances, our
own mutual defences,” Sfraga said. “Alaska, the North American Arctic,
is NATO’s western flank and so we need to think about the Arctic that
way.” </p>
<p>The activity was also a concern for U.S. allies as the Bering Strait
and the Bering Sea give access to the North Pacific and South Pacific,
he said. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said in a report released in July that the growing
alignment between Russia and China in the Arctic was “a concern”.  </p>
<p>China and Russia are trying to develop Arctic shipping routes as
Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western
sanctions. Beijing is seeking an alternative shipping route to reduce
its dependence on the Strait of Malacca. </p>
<p>The Arctic also holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and
the seabed that could become more accessible with global warming.</p>

<p>
While plans to build data centers are creating electricity demand
anxiety all over the country, the boom may not disrupt or strain New
York’s grid, at least for a while,
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/11/01/artificial-intelligence-crash-new-york-electric-grid?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xtIMyo3oVun0TVoO7z6l8I4GLgQ0UffpcKyjm1v29wHMudmjWk8YGRD-Kw97q9HVyTanP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New
York Focus</em> reports</a>. “Despite mounting pressures due to the
state’s climate law and a burst in new manufacturing and tech
facilities, New York has enough power plants operating or planned to
meet statewide demand over the next decade,” the news nonprofit
reported, citing an analysis by NYISO, which operates New York’s
electricity market.<br/><br/>This finding is important because it means
that not every carbon-emitting power plant has to stay open to meet new
demand, which may let New York get closer to achieving its emissions
targets. The reason for the more optimistic forecast is that some of the
largest loads in the state like crypto mining or hydrogen told NYISO
they can shut down during times of high demand on the grid.

<li>Europe’s emissions fall
</h3>
<p>
European Union greenhouse gas emissions fell 8.3% in 2023, according
<a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d0671350-37f2-4bc4-88e8-088d0508fb03_en?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xtIMyo3oVun0TVoO7z6l8I4GLgQ0UffpcKyjm1v29wHMudmjWk8YGRD-Kw97q9HVyTanP" target="_blank">to
the European Commission’s annual climate report</a>. It was the largest
fall in emissions “in several decades,” not counting 2020, when economic
activity plummeted due to Covid-19. Annual emissions have fallen by more
than a third since 1990, while economic activity has increased by
two-thirds since then. The report attributed much of the drop to the
continent’s energy sector, whose emissions dropped 18%.
</p>
<p>
“This drop was due to a substantial increase in renewable electricity
production (primarily wind and solar), at the expense of both coal and
gas and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in both electricity and heat
supply compared with 2022, and to the recovery of hydro and nuclear
power.” The drop in EU emissions stands in contrast to rising emissions
globally in 2023,

It hasn’t been a normal housing market for years now, but it’s been
especially uncertain in the past few months. We delve into how interest
rate cuts, mortgage rate fluctuations, and the election are all making
conditions for buying a home a bit hard to read for most people. Plus, a

gives former US Consulate employee nearly 5-year jail term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>moscow — A Russian former employee of the U.S. Consulate in Russia’s
Far Eastern city of Vladivostok has been sentenced to four years and 10
months in prison for “secret collaboration with a foreign state,”
Russian agencies said Friday.</p>
<p>Robert Shonov worked for more than 25 years for the U.S. Consulate
until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for
foreign missions.</p>
<p>Afterward, he worked as a private contractor compiling news accounts
from publicly accessible Russian media, according to the U.S. State
Department.</p>
<p>He was arrested this year on suspicion of passing secret information
about Russia’s war in Ukraine to the United States in exchange for
money.</p>
<p>According to the judgment published on the website of Valdivostok’s
Primorye court, $4,343 and an electronic device linked to the commission
of the offense were seized.</p>
<p>In September 2023, Russia also expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused
of acting as liaison agents for Shonov.</p>
<p>According to Washington, Shonov had only been hired by the U.S.
Consulate to carry out routine monitoring of freely accessible Russian
media.</p>
<p>In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and
sentenced to long jail terms in Russia. Others are being held pending
trial.</p>
<p>Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against
Russia’s invasion, accuses Moscow of wanting to exchange them for
Russians held in the United States.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia exchanged prisoners including The Wall
Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in a landmark swap in August,
but several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in
Russia.</p>

id="exclusive-us-says-it-is-looking-into-case-of-american-jailed-in-iran">Exclusive:
US says it is looking into case of American jailed in Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration says it is looking into Iran’s apparent
recent detention of an Iranian American dual national who is the only
U.S. citizen publicly reported to have been jailed by the Islamic
republic since a rare U.S.-Iran prisoner swap in September 2023.</p>
<p>Responding to a VOA inquiry last week the State Department said in a
statement that it was “aware of reports that a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen
has been arrested in Iran.”</p>
<p>The reports refer to Reza Valizadeh, a former journalist for VOA
sister network Radio Farda who had left the Persian-language network in
2022. He flew to Tehran in February to visit his family after living in
the West for 14 years, according to his last post on the X platform in
August.</p>
<p>Iran views Radio Farda and other Western-based Persian media as
hostile entities because they draw attention to public dissent and
protests against the nation’s authoritarian Islamist rulers.</p>
<p>“We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting
power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about
this case,” a State Department spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries’ citizens
unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to
international law,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>An informed source inside Iran told VOA’s Persian Service that
Valizadeh was arrested in Iran in late September on charges of
collaborating with overseas-based Persian media. The source requested
anonymity due to Iran’s repeated harassment of individuals who provide
comments publicly to Western media.</p>
<p>The Iran-based human rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran
(HRAI) and the U.S.-based media rights group Committee to Protect
Journalists reported in mid-October that Valizadeh had been held in
Tehran’s Evin prison without access to a lawyer since his arrest. The
reports cited two sources: one close to Valizadeh’s family, and one who
previously worked with Valizadeh.</p>
<p>Iran’s U.N. mission in New York acknowledged receiving a VOA request
for comment about Valizadeh’s case last week but provided no
response.</p>
<p>Skylar Thompson, HRAI’s Washington-based deputy director, said in a
message to VOA that the State Department “must utilize all available
diplomatic channels to investigate Valizadeh’s detention and ensure his
immediate, unhindered access to legal counsel.”</p>
<p>In his last X post in August, Valizadeh wrote that he had returned to
Iran in February after having only “half-completed” a negotiation with
the intelligence arm of Iran’s top military force, the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps. He said he decided to return voluntarily,
even without having received a prior written or verbal commitment that
the IRGC would not impede his visit.</p>
<p>In Valizadeh’s previous X post, published in February upon arrival in
Iran, he said Iranian intelligence agents had summoned and pressured his
family members to persuade him to return.</p>
<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has tried to persuade Iranians
living abroad that they have nothing to fear by returning.</p>
<p>“We must assure them that if they return to Iran, we will not file a
case against them. We will not harass them, and we will not prevent them
from leaving,” Pezeshkian said in an August interview with state news
agency ISNA.</p>
<p>Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against
Nuclear Iran, told VOA that Valizadeh’s arrest should be a warning to
Iranians with dual nationalities that Tehran’s assurances cannot be
trusted.</p>
<p>“There have been cases over the years in which Iranians abroad will
get authorization from one governmental entity in Iran to enter, and
then a competing agency will scoop up this person and take him hostage,”
Brodsky said.</p>
<p>Valizadeh was slated to go on trial before Revolutionary Court judge
Abolghassem Salavati, according to sources cited by HRAI and Iranian
freelance journalist Nejat Bahrami, who first reported Valizadeh’s
arrest in a social media post on October 13. Salavati has been
sanctioned by the U.S. government for harshly punishing Iranian citizens
and dual nationals for exercising their freedoms of expression or
assembly.</p>
<p>“It seems as though Valizadeh is wrongfully detained,” said Kylie
Moore-Gilbert, an Australian political scientist who herself was
detained in Iran from 2018 to 2020 on what Western nations said were
bogus security charges.</p>
<p>In an email to VOA, Moore-Gilbert wrote that Valizadeh’s journalism
“would certainly make him a person of interest to the IRGC.”</p>
<p>“The fact that he has been referred to the Revolutionary Court of
Salavati is also telling, as this judge is favored by the IRGC for
dealing with political cases including the wrongful detention of foreign
and dual nationals,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Granting a wrongful detention designation to a U.S. national means
U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens is authorized to
work with a coalition of government and private sector organizations to
secure the detainee’s freedom.</p>
<p>Designations are granted if a review by the secretary of state
concludes that the U.S. national’s case meets criteria defined in the
Levinson Act of 2020.</p>
<p>Any of Valizadeh’s family members residing abroad or legal
representatives should “immediately apply” to the U.S. secretary of
state for a wrongful detention designation, Moore-Gilbert said.
Valizadeh’s recent work as a journalist should make the process
“relatively straightforward” in contrast to other cases, she added.</p>
<p>The State Department spokesperson who sent the statement to VOA said
the agency “continuously monitors the circumstances surrounding the
detentions of U.S. citizens overseas for indicators that the detentions
may be wrongful.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration secured the release of five Iranian
Americans whom it deemed wrongfully detained in Iran in a September 2023
deal in which five Iranians in the U.S. also won reprieves from
detention and prosecution.</p>
<p>That deal is the only U.S.-Iran prisoner exchange of Biden’s term so
far. It also involved the U.S. allowing $6 billion in Iranian funds
frozen under U.S. sanctions in South Korean banks to be transferred to
Qatar for Iran to use for humanitarian purchases. A U.S. Treasury
Department spokesperson told U.S. media last month that the funds remain
“immobilized” following Iran’s backing of the October 2023 Hamas terror
attack on Israel.</p>
<p>“Valizadeh’s detention raises questions as to whether the Iranians
are holding him hostage for an exchange involving the movement of those
assets in Qatar or something even greater,” Brodsky said.</p>
<p>“Every time we do a deal like that, it emboldens the Iranians to take
more hostages,” he added. “So we need a comprehensive strategy, working
with our allies and partners, to employ common hostage-taking penalties
against Iran involving sanctions and diplomatic isolation.”</p>

<h2
id="college-athletes-push-for-voter-turnout-while-largely-avoiding-controversy-as-election-nears">College
athletes push for voter turnout while largely avoiding controversy as
election nears</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lily Meskers faced an unexpected choice in the lead-up to the first
major election she can vote in.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old University of Montana sprinter was among college
athletes in the state who received an inquiry from Montana Together
asking if she was interested in a name, image and likeness deal to
support Sen. Jon Tester, a three-term Democrat seeking re-election. The
group, which is not affiliated with the Tester campaign, offered from
$400 to $2,400 to athletes willing to produce video endorsements.</p>
<p>Meskers, who is from Colorado but registered to vote in Montana,
decided against the deal because she disagrees with Tester’s votes on
legislation involving transgender athletes in sports.</p>
<p>“I was like, OK, I believe that this is a political move to try to
gain back some voters that he might have lost,” Meskers said. “And me
being a female student-athlete myself, I was not going to give my
endorsement to someone who I felt didn’t have the same support for
me.”</p>
<p>Professional athletes such as LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick and
Stephen Curry have taken high-profile stances on hot-button topics and
political campaigns in recent years, but college athletes are far less
outspoken — even if money is available, according to experts in the NIL
field. Being outwardly political can reflect on their school or endanger
potential endorsement deals from brands that don’t want controversy. It
can certainly establish a public image for an athlete — for better or
for worse — or lead to tensions with teammates and coaches who might not
feel the same way.</p>
<p>There are examples of political activism by college athletes: A Texas
Tech kicker revealed his support for former President Donald Trump on a
shirt under his uniform at a game last week and a handful of Nebraska
athletes a few days ago teamed up in a campaign ad against an abortion
measure on the Tuesday’s ballot.</p>
<p>Still, such steps are considered rare.</p>
<p>“It can be viewed as risky and there may be people telling them just
don’t even take that chance because they haven’t made it yet,” said
Lauren Walsh, who started a sports branding agency 15 years ago. She
said there is often too much to lose for themselves, their handlers and
in some cases, their families.</p>
<p>“And these individuals still have to figure out what they’re going to
do with the rest of their lives, even those that do end up getting
drafted,” she added.</p>
<p>College coaches are not always as reticent. Auburn men’s basketball
coach Bruce Pearl has used social media to make it clear he does not
support Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in next week’s
presidential election. Oklahoma State football coach Mike Gundy once
caused a stir with a star player for wearing a shirt promoting a
far-right news outlet.</p>
<p>Blake Lawrence, co-founder of the NIL platform Opendorse, noted that
this is the first presidential election in the NIL era, which began in
July 2021. He said athletes are flocking to opportunities to help
increase voter turnout in the 18-to-24 age demographic, adding that one
of his company’s partners has had 86 athletes post social media messages
encouraging turnout through the first half of the week. </p>
<p>He said athletes are shying away from endorsing specific candidates
or causes that are considered partisan.</p>
<p>“Student-athletes are, for the most part, still developing their
confidence in endorsing any type of product or service,” he said. “So if
they are hesitant to put their weight behind supporting a local
restaurant or an e-commerce product, then they are certainly going to be
hesitant to use their social channels in a political way.”</p>
<p>Giving athletes a voice</p>
<p>Many college athletes have opted to focus on drumming up turnout in a
non-partisan manner or simply using their platforms to take stands that
are not directly political in nature. Some of those efforts can be found
in battleground states.</p>
<p>A progressive group called NextGen America said it had signed players
in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia
to encourage voting among young people. Another organization, The Team,
said it prepped 27 college athletes in Pennsylvania, North Carolina,
Arizona and Michigan to lead volunteer voter participation opportunities
for students. The organization also said it got more than 625 coaches to
sign a nonpartisan pledge to get their athletes registered to vote.</p>
<p>The Team’s executive director is Joe Kennedy, a former coach who
coordinated championship visits and other sporting events at the White
House during President Barack Obama’s administration. In early October,
it hosted a Zoom event during which panelists such as NCAA President
Charlie Baker and WNBA players Nneka Ogwumike and Natasha Cloud gave
college athletes advice about using their platforms on campus.</p>
<p>In its early days, The Team seized upon momentum from the record
turnout seen in the 2020 election. The NCAA that year said Division I
athletes could have Election Day off from practice and play to vote.
Lisa Kay Solomon, founder of the All Vote No Play campaign, said even if
the athletes don’t immediately take stands on controversial issues, it’s
important for them to learn how.</p>
<p>“It is a lot to ask our young people to feel capable and confident on
skills they’ve never had a chance to practice,” Solomon said. “We have
to model what it means to practice taking risks, practice standing up
for yourself, practice pausing to think about what are the values that
you care about — not what social media is feeding into your brain, but
what do you care about and how do you express that? And how do you do it
in a way that honors the kind of future that you want to be a part
of?”</p>
<p>Shut up and play?</p>
<p>Two years ago, Tennessee-Martin quarterback Dresser Winn said he
would support a candidate in a local district attorney general race in
what experts said was very likely the first political NIL deal by a
college athlete.</p>
<p>There have been very few since.</p>
<p>The public criticism and fallout for athletes who speak out on
politics or social issue can be sharp. Kaepernick, the Super
Bowl-winning quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, hasn’t played in an
NFL game since January 2017, not long after he began kneeling during the
national anthem at games.</p>
<p>Meskers, the Montana sprinter, said political endorsements through
NIL deals could create problems for athletes and their schools.</p>
<p>“I just think that NIL is going to run into a lot of trouble and a
lot of struggles if they continue to let athletes do political
endorsements,” she said. “I just think it’s messy. But I stand by NIL as
a whole. I think it’s really hard as a student athlete to create a
financial income and support yourself.”</p>
<p>Walsh said it’s easier for wealthy and veteran stars like James and
Ogwumike to take stands. James, the Los Angeles Lakers star, started
More Than a Vote — an organization with a mission to “educate, energize
and protect Black voters” — in 2020. He has passed the leadership to
Ogwumike, who just finished her 13th year in the WNBA and also is the
president of the Women’s National Basketball Players Association. More
than a Vote is focused on women’s rights and reproductive freedom this
year.</p>
<p>“They have very established brands,” Walsh said. “They know who they
are and they know what their political stance is. They know that they
have a really strong following that – there’s always going to be haters,
but they’re also always going to have that strong following of people
who listen to everything that they have to say.”</p>
<p>Andra Gillespie, an associate professor at Emory University who
teaches African American politics, also said it is rare that a college
athlete would make a significant impact with a political stand simply
because they tend to have a more regional platform than national. Even
celebrities like Taylor Swift and Eminem are better at increasing
turnout than championing candidates.</p>
<p>“They are certainly very beneficial in helping to drive up turnout
among their fans,” Gillespie said. “The data is less conclusive about
whether or not they’re persuasive – are they the ones who are going to
persuade you to vote for a particular candidate?”</p>
<p>Athletes as influencers</p>
<p>Still, campaigns know young voters are critical this election cycle,
and athletes offer an effective and familiar voice to reach them.</p>
<p>Political and social topics are not often broached, but this week six
Nebraska athletes — five softball players and a volleyball player —
appeared in an ad paid for by the group Protect Women and Children
involving two initiatives about abortion laws on Tuesday’s ballot.</p>
<p>The female athletes backed Initiative 434, which would amend the
state constitution to prohibit abortions after the first trimester, with
exceptions. Star softball player Jordy Bahl said on social media that
the athletes were not paid.</p>
<p>A University of Montana spokesperson said two athletes initially
agreed to take part in the NIL deal backing Tester. The school said one
withdrew and the other declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>For Meskers, deciding against the offer boiled down to Tester twice
voting against proposals to bar federal funds from going to schools that
allow transgender athletes to play women’s sports, a prominent GOP
campaign topic. Tester’s campaign said the proposals were amendments to
government spending packages, and he didn’t want to play a role in
derailing them as government shutdowns loomed.</p>
<p>“As a former public school teacher and school board member, Jon
Tester believes these decisions should be made at the local level,” a
Tester spokesperson said. “He has never voted to allow men to compete
against women.”</p>
<p>Meskers said she believes using influence as college athletes is good
and she is in favor of NIL. She just doesn’t think the two should mix
specifically for supporting candidates.</p>
<p>“I think especially as student athletes, we do have such a big voice
and we do have a platform to use,” she said. “So I think if you’re
encouraging people to do their civic duties and get up and go (vote), I
think that’s a great thing.”</p>

flu infects 3 more people; number of human cases in US grows to 39</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Bird flu has infected three more people from Washington state after
they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus,
according to health authorities in Washington and in Oregon, where the
human cases were identified. </p>
<p>A total of 39 people have tested positive for bird flu in the U.S.
this year, including nine from Washington, as the virus has infected
poultry flocks and spread to more than 400 dairy herds, federal data
show. All of the cases were farm workers who had known contact with
infected animals, except for one person in Missouri. </p>
<p>The people from Washington cleaned facilities at an infected chicken
farm after birds were culled to contain the virus, the Washington State
Department of Health said in an email on Thursday. </p>
<p>Officials tested workers who had symptoms, including red eyes and
respiratory issues, and those with potential exposure to the birds, the
department said. People with symptoms were told to isolate and given
antiviral treatment, it added. </p>
<p>Oregon identified the three new cases after the people traveled to
the state from Washington while infected, the Oregon Health Authority
said in a Thursday statement. They have since returned to Washington,
where public health staff are monitoring them, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>There have been no infections among people living in Oregon and there
is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Oregon Health
Authority said. It said the risk for infection to the general public
remains low. </p>
<p>Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry
birds in the nation’s worst-ever bird flu outbreak. </p>
<p>H5N1 bird flu was confirmed in a pig on a backyard farm in Oregon,
the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.</p>

sues US television network for $10 billion over Harris interview</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sued CBS
News on Thursday over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris that
aired on the network’s “60 Minutes” news program this month.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of
Texas, alleged that the network aired two different responses from
Harris responding to a question about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>The version that aired during the “60 Minutes” program on October 6
did not include what the lawsuit referred to as a “word salad” response
from Harris about the Biden administration’s influence on Israel’s
conduct of the war.</p>
<p>The lawsuit follows Trump’s threats to revoke CBS’s broadcasting
license if elected.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign and office did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>The suit called for a jury trial and about $10 billion in damages,
the filing showed. It alleges violations of a Texas law that prohibits
deceptive acts in the conduct of business.</p>
<p>A CBS News spokesperson told VOA that “Trump’s repeated claims
against 60 Minutes are false” and that the interview was not
doctored.</p>
<p>“60 MINUTES fairly presented” the interview “to inform the viewing
audience, and not to mislead it,” the spokesperson said in an email.
“The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without
merit and we will vigorously defend against it.”</p>
<p>In a statement earlier this month, CBS said “60 Minutes” gave an
excerpt of the Harris interview to “Face the Nation” that used a longer
section of her answer than what was aired on “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p>“Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the
response,” the statement said. “The portion of her answer on ‘60
Minutes’ was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a
wide-ranging, 21-minute-long segment.”</p>
<p>And in a letter to Trump’s legal counsel earlier this month, CBS said
Trump has no legal basis to sue over the interview, CNN reported.</p>
<p>Trump had also agreed to give an interview to “60 Minutes” before
ultimately backing out.</p>
<p>Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without
Borders, dismissed the lawsuit as a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>“The lawsuit itself looks like a publicity stunt, but it reinforces
the very real threats that Trump has issued to use the U.S. government
to punish media outlets he doesn’t like should he regain the White
House,” Weimers told VOA.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="chinese-student-convicted-in-us-returned-to-china">Chinese
student convicted in US returned to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Xiaolei Wu, a Chinese student who had been serving a
nine-month prison sentence for threatening pro-democracy activists in
Boston, received an early release on September 16 and returned to China,
according to federal documents obtained by VOA’s Mandarin Service.</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese officials have not commented publicly on Wu and
whether he may have been part of a prisoner swap, but his return to
China came about the time that American pastor David Lin was released
and returned to the United States after serving 18 years in prison.</p>
<p>Documents from the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts and the U.S.
Justice Department confirm Wu’s release and that President Joe Biden
signed a clemency document on September 12, reducing Wu’s total sentence
to time served, saying that it was in the “national interest” of the
United States for him not to serve his full sentence.</p>
<p>The pardon document states that Wu began serving his sentence on June
7. The conditions for the commutation said Wu must leave the United
States and never again set foot on U.S. soil and territories, and that
he must not commit any crimes against the U.S. or violate U.S. laws
again.</p>
<p>Wu, a former student of Berklee College of Music, was found guilty in
January of stalking and threatening a pro-democracy activist in Boston
in fall 2022. On April 24, Wu was sentenced to nine months in prison and
three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Wu, 26, threatened to chop off the hands of a
Chinese pro-democracy activist known as “Zooey,” a pseudonym that the
Berklee student has used to avoid retaliation. Wu threatened to report
Zooey’s family to Chinese police and asked others to find out where she
lived. He also published Zooey’s email address.</p>
<p>Two of Zooey’s friends told VOA Mandarin on Wednesday that Zooey
learned from prosecutors in September that Wu had been released and
reciprocally exchanged for Lin.</p>
<p>The two friends, who requested anonymity, citing security concerns,
said Zooey was shocked and puzzled by this and worried about her
safety.</p>
<p>One of Zooey’s friends said he received a threatening message from Wu
on Instagram a few days ago.</p>
<p>The message said: “Do you really think that I won’t be able to find
you if you wear a mask and change your voice on Voice of America?”</p>
<p>Another friend said that Wu recently posted a video of himself
playing guitar on WeChat, China’s biggest social media platform. The
location indicated it was published in Beijing.</p>
<p>Zhou Fengsuo, a former student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen
Square pro-democracy movement in China and co-founder of the NGO
Humanitarian China, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview that while Wu
had gotten off easy, his case may serve as a deterrent against future
similar cases.</p>
<p>“This is a very important case. We have observed that the Chinese
pro-CCP nationalists have been restrained a lot on American campuses,”
Zhou said.</p>
<p>“I have participated in activities in many American universities this
year and have not encountered any of these people. I believe this has a
lot to do with Wu’s conviction. Of course, his early release is not the
result we want to see.”</p>
<p>Zhou also said that if Wu’s release is indeed part of an exchange for
David Lin, it could mean that Wu has certain connections in China.</p>
<p>He also told VOA Mandarin the swap is still beneficial.</p>
<p>“Pastor David Lin was detained in China for a very long time, so it
is still very precious to exchange for his return,” Zhou said.</p>
<p>VOA was unable to independently confirm whether Wu’s early release
was directly related to the release of Lin.</p>
<p>VOA contacted the U.S. State Department and the Massachusetts U.S.
Attorney’s Office in charge of Wu’s case but has yet to receive a
response. The White House declined to comment to VOA.</p>

YouTube.</p>
<p>Russian business newspaper RBC reported this week that legal claims
brought by 17 Russian TV channels against Google in Russian courts,
which have imposed compound fines on Google, had reached $20 decillion —
an incomprehensible sum with 34 zeros.</p>
<p>By comparison, the International Monetary Fund estimates the world’s
total gross domestic product to be $110 trillion. Google’s parent
company Alphabet, meanwhile, has a market value of around $2
trillion.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov admitted to reporters
that he “can’t even pronounce this figure right.” But he said the fine
was “filled with symbolism.”</p>
<p>“Google should not restrict the activities of our broadcasters, and
Google is doing this,” he said.</p>
<p>The Russian state-run outlet Tass reported this week that a Russian
court had previously ordered Google to restore the blocked YouTube
channels or face rising charges. The fine has grown so high because it
doubles every week.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Russia experienced a mass YouTube outage in
August. The platform is considered one of the few remaining sites where
audiences can access independent information in Russia, where Moscow
blocks independent news sites and press freedom has all but
disappeared.</p>
<p>Google did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting
comment.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Reuters.</p>

This Halloween, we’re looking at some new inflation data that’s got the
Federal Reserve in good spirits. Its preferred inflation measure shows
inflation fell to
<a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index">2.1%</a>
last month, moving ever-so-closer to the Fed’s 2% target. We’ll get into
why core inflation complicates the Fed’s good news. And, we’ll unpack

<h2 id="un-warns-global-hunger-hot-spots-growing">UN warns global hunger
hot spots growing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A new U.N. report warned Thursday that conflict, climate
and economic stress are driving severe hunger and in some cases famine
conditions, in 22 countries and territories, with no likelihood for
improvement in the next six months.</p>
<p>“So, you have conflict impacts, climate impacts in the same
countries, as well as both the combination of the two turns into
economic devastation for people,” Arif Husain, chief economist of the
World Food Program, said of the main drivers of the hunger crises to
reporters in a video briefing.</p>
<p>The situation is most severe in the Gaza Strip, Sudan, South Sudan,
Haiti and Mali, where millions of people are in the highest levels of
food insecurity, meaning famine, risk of famine or starvation are
happening.</p>
<p>In Gaza, U.N. food agencies have been warning about the critical
situation for months. It is fueled by the nearly 13-month war between
Israel and Hamas, which has made it dangerous and difficult for
humanitarians to get food and other assistance to about 2 million
Palestinians trapped in the crossfire.</p>
<p>WFP’s Husain said 91% of Gazans are at crisis levels or worse for
hunger, with about 345,000 of them in faminelike conditions.</p>
<p>“And the report says basically that there is a risk — there’s a
persistent risk — of famine for the entire Gaza Strip,” Husain said.</p>
<p>The situation in Sudan is even worse because the numbers of people
are dramatically higher.</p>
<p>“Time is running out to save lives,” Rein Paulsen, director of the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Office of Emergencies and
Resilience, told reporters of Sudan.</p>
<p>“People are facing total collapse of livelihoods and starvation in
areas where conflict is hitting the hardest across the country,
including in Darfur, in Jazira, in Khartoum and in Kordofan,” he
said.</p>
<p>Paulsen noted that famine levels of food insecurity were reported two
months ago in the Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where several hundred
thousand internally displaced people are sheltering. Fighting has
escalated in recent months in that region between the army and a rival
paramilitary group.</p>
<p>“And those famine conditions are likely — highly likely — to persist
unless something changes,” he said.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is in the grip of a serious hunger
crisis because of the rampant violence from armed gangs whose
kidnappings, killings, rapes and looting have left Haitians in the
capital and some outlying areas afraid to leave their homes.</p>
<p>Two million people do not have enough to eat, and about 6,000 of them
are experiencing famine levels of food insecurity, Paulsen said.</p>
<p>“Immediate action is imperative to save lives, to prevent starvation,
and to help vulnerable populations restore their livelihoods amidst
unprecedented violence and displacement,” he added.</p>
<p>In Africa, Mali and South Sudan are also at the top of the list of
hunger hot spots.</p>
<p>WFP’s Husain said about 2,500 people are at catastrophic or famine
levels of hunger in Mali and another 121,000 are right behind them.</p>
<p>In South Sudan, affected by the war in Sudan and severe flooding, the
number of people facing starvation and death was projected in the report
to nearly double between April and July to 2.3 million, compared with
the same period in 2023. Hunger is expected to worsen when the next lean
season begins in May.</p>
<p>A step behind these most affected countries are those of “very high
concern” for humanitarians, including Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen.</p>
<p>“These are classified and categorized in this context where we have a
high number of people facing particular acute food insecurity, and where
we also see drivers that are expected to further intensify
life-threatening conditions in the coming months,” Paulsen said.</p>
<p>Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and Niger are new to the list of hunger hot
spots this year, joining Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, Zambia
and Zimbabwe to round out the list.</p>
<p>WFP’s Husain said humanitarians need both resources and safe access
to assist the millions of people in need to bring the high rates of
hunger and malnutrition down.</p>

<h2 id="harris-trump-trade-barbs-over-treatment-of-women">Harris, Trump
trade barbs over treatment of women</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump
sparred over how women should be treated in society as they looked for
votes Thursday in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest political
battleground states.</p>
<p>Polling shows Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, the
Republican candidate, are virtually tied in the two states. Arizona and
Nevada are among seven closely contested states across the 50-state
country that are likely to determine the national outcome in next
Tuesday’s election.</p>
<p>In the other 43, polling shows Trump or Harris with either decisive
or comfortable leads.</p>
<p>Appeals to Latino voters are central to the campaigns in both Arizona
and Nevada. Trump won Arizona in his successful 2016 campaign for the
presidency but lost it to President Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats won
Nevada in both elections.</p>
<p>Migrants crossing from Mexico into the United States across the
border in Arizona are at the center of the political debate in the
state. Trump has pledged to finish the border wall he started during his
2017-2021 White House tenure. He has also vowed to round up and deport
undocumented migrants living in the U.S., while accusing Harris of being
weak on controlling the influx of migrants.</p>
<p>Harris has said she will look to enact legislation calling for
tougher asylum rules at U.S. entry points to curb the tens of thousands
of migrants crossing into the U.S. She supports an immigration bill
drafted by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators that Trump leaned on
Republican lawmakers to kill earlier this year.</p>
<p>Pop icon Jennifer Lopez is to join Harris on stage Thursday night at
a rally in Las Vegas, the U.S. gambling mecca.</p>
<p>Trump has scheduled an interview in Arizona with ex-Fox News host
Tucker Carlson and a rally in neighboring Nevada.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump met only once face to face in a debate, but trade
insults and taunts every day from rally stages, in campaign ads and over
the airwaves.</p>
<p>Their latest dispute is over the treatment of women.</p>
<p>Trump said at a rally on Wednesday in the Midwest state of Wisconsin
that he would protect American women “whether the women like it or
not.”</p>
<p>He cast the remark as paternal, but it served to remind his critics
of his history of misogynistic statements and a civil court case that
found him liable for sexual abuse of a New York writer in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Trump told supporters that his advisers had urged him to stop
proclaiming his desire to protect women, saying they had called it
“inappropriate.”</p>
<p>But he told rally-goers, “I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether
the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.’”</p>
<p>Polls show Harris with a wide lead among female voters; Trump
substantially leads with men.</p>
<p>Harris quickly jumped on Trump’s remark, writing on X, “Donald Trump
thinks he should get to make decisions about what you do with your body.
Whether you like it or not.” On Thursday, she said that Trump’s views on
women showed that he does not understand “their rights and their ability
to make decisions about their own lives.”</p>
<p>Nearly 62 million people have already voted at polling stations or by
mail. More than 155 million voted in the 2020 election, about two-thirds
of them early or by mail and a third of them on the official Election
Day.</p>
<p>The importance of battleground states like Arizona, Nevada and the
five others cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular
vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50
state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their
electoral votes to the winner in that state. Nebraska and Maine allocate
theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts.</p>
<p>The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population,
so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall
national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes
to claim the presidency.</p>
<p>Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable
leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes
or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be
decided in the remaining seven states, where both Harris and Trump have
staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for
campaign stops.</p>
<p>Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of
statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Less than a week after election night in the U.S., the United Nations’
annual climate conference begins in Azerbaijan. COP29, as this year’s
conference is called, has climate finance and carbon markets on the
agenda. It’s no secret that the outcome of the U.S. presidential
election could shift the tenor of negotiations significantly on both
topics. Everyone knows there’s one candidate who’s better for the
climate and one who will be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>much</u></a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>much</u></a>
worse.
</p>
<p>
Even if Harris wins, however, the United States may well continue to
shirk its global climate finance obligations. If the U.S. can’t deliver
on what it promises at COP29, it may not matter what actually happens
there.
</p>
<p>
Negotiators at COP29 are tasked with setting what’s called the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/cop29-bonn-climate-finance" target="_self"><u>New
Collective Quantified Goal</u></a> on climate finance, a goalpost for
the amount of cash governments must put up to meet global climate
investment needs. Global South countries excluding China have suggested
that they require
<a href="https://www.cseindia.org/a-cse-position-paper-show-us-the-money-12434" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $1 trillion per year in external finance</u></a> to meet their
climate targets. An agreed-upon NCQG will also help all countries flesh
out the latest iteration of their national climate plans, also known as
Nationally Determined Contributions, as required by the Paris climate
agreement.
</p>
<p>
And yet preliminary discussions over the summer were
<a href="https://www.cseindia.org/a-cse-position-paper-show-us-the-money-12434" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inconclusive</u></a>,
not just on the NCQG target itself but also on which countries are
expected to contribute and what kinds of financing (e.g. public,
private, loans, grants) will count toward it. More
<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/04/global-un-special-rapporteur-is-right-to-raise-human-rights-concerns-about-carbon-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>controversially</u></a>
to some climate activists and civil society groups, negotiators are also
using COP29 to finalize a framework for the implementation of Article 6
of the Paris Agreement, which calls for the creation of a global carbon
credit market, which countries could use to trade emissions reductions
and contribute to each others’ NDCs.
</p>
<p>
To put it simply: If Donald Trump wins, not much of this will matter.
President Biden’s negotiators can still endorse ambitious NCQG and
Article 6 targets, but there’s no evidence a second Trump administration
will commit to delivering on them. Should Trump win, the U.S. will
almost certainly cut itself out of the global climate finance
architecture
<a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a

authored largely by
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/22/us/politics/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump
associates</u></a>, not only
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-would-jeopardize-global-climate-action/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>calls</u></a>
for the U.S. to slash global climate and development funding (as Trump
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/16/520399205/trumps-budget-slashes-climate-change-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
called for</u></a> in his first term) but also to withdraw from global
negotiating fora entirely. In the breach, Trump administration diplomats
will likely stress the importance of gas and non-renewable energy
technologies (such as carbon capture) with an emphasis on ensuring
domestic energy security and affordability, even as they prepare to gut
most if not all of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.
</p>
<p>
A Kamala Harris victory next week will assuredly be much better for both
global emissions reductions and the climate diplomacy landscape. While
she has outlined no specific proposals for global climate policy in
particular, there is also no evidence that she will renege on any U.S.
global commitments made in the past four years or attempt to repeal any
climate laws.
</p>
<p>
As president, she will likely preserve President Biden’s key global
climate and development policy initiatives, including the Just Energy
Transition Partnerships and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment. She will also likely support the Biden administration’s
push to see the multilateral development banks
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/getting-here-there-scaling-climate-finance-ncqg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support
more investments</u></a> in climate and development, particularly
through mobilizing the private sector. The current World Bank President,
Ajay Banga, was nominated by the United States in early 2023 after
serving as co-chair of the

terms if Harris is elected.
</p>
<p>
While none of this is directly connected to COP29 (and putting
<a href="https://www.break-down.org/post/downward-mobilisation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>doubts</u></a>
about the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/cop29-bonn-climate-finance" target="_self"><u>efficacy</u></a>
of these programs aside), it speaks to the Biden-Harris administration’s
commitment to, at the very least, platforming global climate and
development issues. But will Harris actually deliver on the U.S.’s
commitments to the NCQG or otherwise meaningfully increase the amount of
public spending devoted to global climate and development goals?
Probably not ― although in that case, Congress will be the more likely
culprit, not her.
</p>
<p>
Attempts to appropriate additional funds for global climate programs are
cursed with a severe case of legislative inertia. Congress
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/2020-budget-shows-progress-climate-finance-us-continues-fall-behind-peers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>did
not</u></a> significantly slash funding for global climate priorities
during the first Trump presidency, but it also
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/how-us-can-still-meet-its-global-climate-finance-pledges" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>did
not</u></a> raise it much during the Biden presidency. Last year’s
bipartisan debt limit negotiations
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-real-climate-defeat-in-the-debt-ceiling-deal" target="_self"><u>didn’t
help</u></a>, of course. But even in the early Biden presidency, when
Democrats had their narrow trifecta, Congress massively
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joe-thwaites/how-us-can-still-meet-its-global-climate-finance-pledges" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>undershot</u></a>
Biden’s budget requests for global climate-related priorities. In fiscal
year 2022, Congress passed less than half of what Biden requested; since
then, presidential requests for global climate spending have ballooned
in size, while appropriations have stayed flat.
</p>
<p>
This divergence reflects a stable short-term equilibrium: The Biden
administration can showcase the full range of its commitments and bona
fides and blame Congress for its failure to deliver on any of them,
while Congress can coast on the spending cap deals it made to avoid
government shutdowns. But it also ignores the planet-sized elephant in
the room — that there’s been no new spending on mitigating climate
change. Regardless of who is president, there’s only so much
discretionary funding they can ever reallocate toward priority programs
absent additional appropriations.
</p>
<p>
(Here it seems pertinent to remind everyone that the U.S. has never
endorsed the global consensus framework of “common but differentiated
responsibilities,” which would mean acknowledging a quasi-legal
obligation to provide climate finance to Global South countries, on
account of the fact that Congress has never been enthusiastic about
this. The chances that anyone changes their tone are slim.)
</p>
<p>
In summary, even if Harris comes out on top on Tuesday, the U.S. will
still be stuck in a holding pattern with respect to its global climate
priorities. This puts the Biden administration’s COP29 negotiators in a
vise: Pushing for a low NCQG gives other countries ground to criticize
the U.S.’s inadequate ambition and care for the Global South relative to
its ability to contribute, but pushing for an ambitious NCQG also gives
other countries greater reason to criticize the U.S. if it fails to
deliver. Ambition was never the problem; it has always been the
delivery.
</p>
<p>
Optimistically, a Harris victory at least prevents the U.S. from being a
roadblock to other countries’ climate action. But at a time when
<a href="https://www.devex.com/news/money-matters-what-next-for-the-shrinking-german-aid-budget-108120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major</u></a>

to global climate and development challenges makes the rest of the world
more
<a href="https://www.break-down.org/post/downward-mobilisation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dependent</u></a>
on private capital and, in turn, more vulnerable to market downturns,
interest rate hikes, and
<a href="https://www.nb.com/en/global/insights/cio-weekly-perspectives-re-emerging-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>capital

<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/marshall-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less
able</u></a> to count on large Chinese capital inflows from here on
out.) As

report</u></a> after
<a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/strengthening-multilateral-development-banks-triple-agenda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expert
report</u></a> has detailed, climate change mitigation or adaptation
simply will not happen at scale across the Global South without
substantial new external financing.
</p>
<p>
Still, in lieu of new financing, a Harris administration could stress
that efforts to catalyze private investment in the Global South
(including through
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b07edf26-1eae-425a-b284-5d48bcbee7e8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>voluntary
carbon markets</u></a>) and reform global taxation also contribute to
global decarbonization. And it could continue to argue that the U.S. is
doing its part to decarbonize if it manages to pass more landmark
climate and green industrialization laws like the Inflation Reduction
Act. But it would be false to argue ― as
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/11/11/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-27th-conference-of-the-parties-to-the-framework-convention-on-climate-change-cop27-sharm-el-sheikh-egypt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>President

<a href="https://in.usembassy.gov/remarks-by-secretary-of-the-treasury-janet-l-yellen-at-microsoft-in-new-delhi-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Secretary
Janet Yellen</u></a> have done at times, particularly in 2022 ― that the
Inflation Reduction Act helps lower the cost of clean tech uptake across
the Global South. This is not true — the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-discounts-its-way-record-solar-module-exports-2024-08-01/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>credit</u></a>
for making clean technology, particularly solar energy, cheaper and more
accessible for the Global South goes
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/china-s-ev-and-solar-exports-are-powering-ahead-as-prices-slide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decisively</u></a>
to China. The U.S. is nowhere close to becoming a major clean technology
exporter or a bona fide partner in green industrial transformation for
any Global South country, policymakers’ pretensions to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
One prominent member of Harris’s advisory team, President Biden’s former
National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, is
<a href="https://ceepr.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MIT-CEEPR-RC-2024-04.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trying</u></a>
to change that, advancing ideas like a
“<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/case-clean-energy-marshall-plan-deese" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean
Energy Marshall Plan</u></a>” as an opportunity to deliver on both
domestic industrial policy priorities and demands for global leadership
vis-a-vis China; his writing exemplifies how American climate diplomacy
is being
<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/21/us-china-competition-battery-production-ev-minerals-solid-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>subsumed</u></a>
into national security
<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/09/energy-innovation-us-industrial-stature?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>planning</u></a>.
(Deese is also a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/briandeese" target="_blank">Heatmap
contributor</a>.) Tactically, this might work in the near-term: The
<a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/race-reauthorization-what-new-house-bill-would-mean-dfc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bill
to reauthorize the Development Finance Corporation</u></a>, which would
boost the U.S.’s ability to invest in decarbonization-related priorities
across the Global South and particularly critical minerals supply
chains, cleared the House Foreign Affairs Committee with bipartisan
support over the summer. But this is
<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/marshall-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not</u></a>
a strategy that on its own centers the climate and development needs of
Global South countries.
</p>
<p>
So while a Democratic victory next week would certainly be a step toward
continued climate action, and while what the Biden administration
negotiates at COP29 will at least set a floor for future U.S.
commitments (even if that floor is performative), we won’t see a major
departure from the status quo unless a Harris administration can
convince legislators that American leadership requires a lot more
American money.
</p>
<p>
“We are not going back” ― this much is true. But it would be nice to go
forward, too.

<p>
This morning, the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation — the
personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE — came out and
clocked in at 2.1% annually in September. With fuel and energy prices
stripped out, the index was up 2.7%. What should we make of these
figures? Then, if former President Donald Trump is re-elected, he’s
promising steep tariffs on goods entering the U.S. We’ll explore the
knock-on effects.

Wednesday for The Fight</a>. Several companies have pulled out of or
paused projects; CNX indefinitely stepped away from a blue hydrogen hub
in West Virginia, while Fortescue would not confirm that a hydro-powered
production plant intended for Washington state will still be built.<br/>
<br/> “Conversations with experts and stakeholders indicate to me this
could be evidence of broader macroeconomic issues hitting the hydrogen
industry, from inflation pushing up the price of electrolyzers to the
stubbornly low price of natural gas,” Holzman wrote. Or perhaps it’s “a
calm before a storm of hydrogen investment” that’ll follow full
implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act’s production tax credit.
Jael’s take? “This is further proof we live in a disorganized energy
transition.”

id="european-allies-face-challenging-times-whoever-wins-us-presidential-election">European
allies face challenging times, whoever wins US presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BERLIN — The United States’ European allies are bracing for an
America that’s less interested in them no matter who wins the
presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald
Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia’s full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest
contribution to Kyiv’s defense. There are question marks over whether
that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO
allies in general.</p>
<p>A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a
continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and
growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe
that support would wane.</p>
<p>Trump’s appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is
causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic
growth. But it’s not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency
that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead.</p>
<p>European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter
who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right
now, but the long-term priority is China.</p>
<p>“The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it
was in Biden’s formative years,” said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior
research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.
“And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic
president.”</p>
<p>The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. “That means
Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and
also become more capable of managing its own security area.”</p>
<p>Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed
a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more
on the Indo-Pacific region, “so it is only a question of, will they do
much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less.”</p>
<p>Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in
Brussels, said that “above all, Europe is looking for predictability
from Washington,” and that’s in short supply in a turbulent world in
which any administration will face other demands on its attention. “But
the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a
potential Trump administration.”</p>
<p>“There is an assumption of essential continuity” under Harris that’s
probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy
under Biden likely to remain. “It’s very much the known world, even if
the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own.”</p>
<p>While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on
competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means “the potential
costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are
very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago,”
Lesser said. Europe’s ability to deal with that depends on how quickly
it happens, he said.</p>
<p>Europe’s lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both
parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their
game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the
32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic
product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago.</p>
<p>During his 2017-21 term, Trump threatened to abandon ” delinquent ”
countries if they weren’t paying their “bills.” In campaigning this
time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them.</p>
<p>His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an
increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
Poland.</p>
<p>Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way
the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war
fatigue emerging in Europe itself.</p>
<p>If Trump wins, “there’s every indication that he has no interest in
continuing to support Ukraine in this war” and will push quickly for
some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like
and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. “And there is also
just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were
to withdraw support.”</p>
<p>“Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing
debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next
in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game,” Lesser said.</p>
<p>Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a
brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and
British leaders.</p>
<p>“We cannot let up. We must sustain our support,” Biden said. “In my
view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable
peace.”</p>
<p>The times he has lived through have taught him that “we should never
underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of
alliances,” the 81-year-old Biden added.</p>
<p>German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany’s
highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations,
hopes Biden’s compatriots are listening.</p>
<p>“In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is
indispensable for us,” he said. “And I also hope that Americans
remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just
‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends.”</p>
<p>Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy.</p>
<p>“Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away
angry,” Lesser said, noting there’s “every prospect” of divided
government in Washington. “Europe is going to face a very chaotic and
sometimes dysfunctional America.”</p>

X ineffective against surge of US election misinformation, report
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The crowd-sourced fact-checking feature of Elon Musk’s X, Community
Notes, is “failing to counter false” claims about the U.S. election, the
Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said in a report
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Out of the 283 misleading posts that CCDH has analyzed on the digital
social media platform, 209 or 74% of the posts did not show accurate
notes to all X users correcting false and misleading claims about the
elections, the report said.</p>
<p>“The 209 misleading posts in our sample that did not display
available Community Notes to all users have amassed 2.2 billion views,”
CCDH said, urging the company to invest in safety and transparency.</p>
<p>X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
<p>X launched its “Community Notes” feature last year, which allows
users to comment on posts to flag false or misleading content, in effect
crowd-sourcing fact checking to users rather than a dedicated team of
fact checkers.</p>
<p>The report comes after X lost a lawsuit brought by CCDH earlier this
year that faulted it for allowing a rise in hate speech on the social
media platform.</p>
<p>Social media platforms, including X, have been under scrutiny for
years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories,
including false information about elections and vaccines.</p>
<p>Secretaries of state from five U.S. states urged billionaire Musk in
August to fix X’s AI chatbot, saying it had spread misinformation
related to the November 5 election.</p>
<p>Musk, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in
July, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. Polls show
Trump is in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala
Harris.</p>

<h2 id="iran-wary-over-us-presidential-election">Iran wary over US
presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TEHRAN, Iran — America’s presidential election next week comes just
after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage
crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just
as high as they did then.</p>
<p>Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its
allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described “Axis of
Resistance” — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip
targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks
against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing
damage from Israel’s strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in
response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks.</p>
<p>Iran’s currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the
dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear
program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade
levels.</p>
<p>In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran’s mandatory law on the
headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022
death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country.</p>
<p>That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the
capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President
Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which
candidate would be better for their country — if at all.</p>
<p>“All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same
views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change,” said Sadegh
Rabbani, 65.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump have offer hard-line views on Iran</p>
<p>Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on
Iran.</p>
<p>In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran’s nuclear
deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle
East even before Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has
been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his
decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran’s top general,
Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that
she would always “give Israel the ability to defend itself, in
particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its
proxies pose to Israel.”</p>
<p>For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations
with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results,
though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans
detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023.</p>
<p>In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth,
22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win.</p>
<p>“We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy,”
Rezaei told The Associated Press. “It is time for a woman … I think she
(Harris) will better since she is not after war.”</p>
<p>Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student,
agreed.</p>
<p>“I think Harris knows the world better,” he said. “She and (Joe)
Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This
mean moving toward peace.”</p>
<p>Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a
better fit.</p>
<p>“I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to
get a quick deal with Iran,” said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a
double-glazed window workshop. “The Biden administration including
Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when
they were in power.”</p>
<p>Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may
lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops
from the Mideast during his term in office.</p>
<p>Iran’s government wants sanctions gone</p>
<p>Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run
television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters
with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by
immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the
camera.</p>
<p>Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct
United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins.</p>
<p>While saying he wants Trump to win “for my own reasons,” 53-year-old
Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war “100%” sure to
happen.</p>
<p>A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for
speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any
deals with Iran because “men can talk to men.”</p>
<p>“I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of
course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for
us,” said Fariba Oodi.</p>
<p>“We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our
kids are paying a price for that,” she added. “But I still think if it’s
Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student
and plans to apply” to study in America.</p>
<p>Iran’s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a
helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came
to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions.</p>
<p>Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from
Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling
in the November election, which Tehran denies.</p>
<p>Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Pezeshkian’s administration,
said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the
“national sovereignty of other countries.” It also wants Washington to
“avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years,” she
said.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible
U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The talks will be a war of attrition,” Ali Soufi told the pro-reform
Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such
talks “are unlikely to be fruitful.”</p>
<p>But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>“You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents” come and go, said
Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher “He knows how to deal with
the next one.”</p>

id="americans-are-anxious-and-frustrated-about-the-presidential-campaign-an-ap-norc-poll-finds">Americans
are anxious and frustrated about the presidential campaign, an AP-NORC
poll finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Most Americans are feeling a lot of emotions heading
into Election Day, but excitement is not one of them.</p>
<p>A new poll from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds
that about 7 in 10 Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about
the 2024 presidential campaign, and a similar share say they’re
interested.</p>
<p>Only about one-third say they feel excited.</p>
<p>There’s a broad feeling of uncertainty hanging over the 2024
presidential contest during the last week of the campaign. The race is
competitive nationally and in key swing states, according to recent
polls, with neither Democrat Kamala Harris nor Republican Donald Trump
showing a measurable advantage.</p>
<p>At the same time, the candidates have offered closing arguments that
are in stark contrast with each other, with Harris arguing that Trump is
obsessed with revenge and his own personal needs, while Trump referred
to Harris at a rally on Sunday night as “a trainwreck who has destroyed
everything in her path.”</p>
<p>Some groups are even more anxious than they were four years ago, even
though that election took place in the midst of a deadly pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2020, an AP-NORC poll found that about two-thirds of Americans
were anxious about the election, which is not statistically significant
from the new result. But for partisans, anxiety is dialed a little
higher.</p>
<p>About 8 in 10 Democrats say anxious describes how they are feeling
now, up slightly from around three-quarters in the last election. About
two-thirds of Republicans are anxious, a moderate uptick from around 6
in 10 in 2020.</p>
<p>Independents, by contrast, haven’t shifted meaningfully, and they’re
also feeling less worried than Democrats or Republicans. About half say
they are anxious, similar to the finding in 2020.</p>
<p>Other emotions have gotten more intense compared to past election
cycles, including excitement. About one-third of Americans report
feeling excited about the 2024 campaign, up from around one-quarter in
2016. But a majority of Americans say they are not excited about this
year’s race.</p>
<p>One thing has stayed fairly constant, though: Americans’ level of
frustration with the campaign. Roughly 7 in 10 Americans say frustrated
describes their emotional state, similar to 2020.</p>

trick-or-treat at White House; first lady dresses as panda for
Halloween</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who dressed as a
giant panda, hosted trick-or-treaters on the White House South Lawn on
Wednesday for the last time.</p>
<p>The first lady had participated in the National Zoo’s announcement
earlier this year that pandas would be returning to Washington. They
arrived in the nation’s capital in mid-October and Jill Biden donned the
panda suit Wednesday as a “welcoming gesture,” the White House said.</p>
<p>Jill Biden added an educational theme to the event and named it
“Hallo-Read” to help encourage reading. She has been a teacher for 40
years. Earlier Wednesday, she read a short story about spooky pumpkins
to a group of costumed children gathered on the lawn.</p>
<p>She and the president later ventured outside at sunset and spent
about an hour handing out treats. Biden, in a suit and tie, dropped
boxes of White House Hershey’s Kisses chocolates in the kids’ tote bags
while the first lady handed out copies of “10 Spooky Pumpkins.”</p>
<p>Up to 8,000 people, including students and children tied to the
military, were expected to pass through the White House gates during the
day.</p>
<p>A large orange moon and a sign that said “Hallow-Read at the White
House” decorated the south face of the executive mansion. The
decorations also included cardboard representations of Willow, the
family cat who is rarely seen in public, and stacks of books. Giant
pumpkin decorations flanked the door.</p>
<p>Biden dropped his bid for reelection in July. He leaves office in
January.</p>

Consumer spending has been strong since the post-pandemic-crash economy
got back on its feet, and it continues to prop up GDP. But too much
spending, as well as too little, could mess with the Federal Reserve’s
goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Also in this episode:

The cloud computing company CoreWeave announced Monday that it is
leasing a former medical research facility and turning it into a data
center. Along with it comes a 25-megawatt power plant that once provided
power and steam directly to the former Merck headquarters in Kenilworth,
New Jersey, but began to sell more and more power to the grid, the
plant’s owner said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. In 2023, the facility

purchased</u></a> by Onyx, a real estate firm, and Machine Investment
Group, with the intention to market the site to another life sciences or
biotechnology company.
</p>
<p>
Then the AI revolution happened.
</p>
<p>
CoreWeave, which started as a miner of cryptocurrency,
<a href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/coreweave-secures-7-5-billion-debt-financing-facility-led-by-blackstone-and-magnetar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
now raising and spending billions</u></a> of dollars to acquire and
install the chips necessary to train and run artificial intelligence
systems for companies that rent out access to them. According to the
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coreweave-signs-280-000-sf-lease-at-onyx-and-machines-northeast-science--technology-center-in-kenilworth-302289222.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>deal
announcement</u></a>, the company plans to pour $1.2 billion of
investment into the 280,000 square foot facility, along with electrical
upgrades from the utility PSE&amp;G and investments from Onyx. The power
plant will stop serving the grid and go “behind the meter,” the plant’s
owner Atlantic Power
<a href="https://www.pjm.com/planning/service-requests/gen-deactivations/generator-deactivation-notices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in a letter to PJM Interconnection</u></a>, the regional electricity
market, in September.
</p>
<p>
The deal confirms that when it comes to power, data centers will

what they can get</u></a> — and that the long timelines necessary to
bring on new power in much of the country may end up benefiting existing
owners of generation, especially natural gas.
</p>
<p>
Data centers require both large amounts of power — sometimes 100
megawatts or more — and the ability to surge up and down quickly.
“Renewable power generation is well placed to capture mounting demand
from data centers and AI in the long term,” analysts at BNEF wrote in a
report in September, “but time constraints for grid interconnection and
intermittency issues could support natural gas-fired output.”
</p>
<p>
Goldman Sachs
<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/pages/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analysts
expect data center power demand</u></a> to rise from about 3% of the
U.S. total to 8% by 2030, with growth running at 15% annually. They
assume that capacity will be met mostly by natural gas, but actually
finding — let alone building — new natural gas generation is a
challenge.
</p>
<p>
“The hyperscalers are evolving from single data centers dependent on 60
to 100 megawatts to starting to look at multiple gigawatt-size data
center parks that support a number of data centers in one location,” GE
Vernova chief executive Scott Strazik said on a recent earnings call
with analysts.
</p>
<p>
Building a new natural gas plant on the grid — and especially the
transmission infrastructure to serve it — can be a prospect well beyond
the build-it-now timelines of big technology companies with a desperate
need for computing power.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks to 10-year delays in permitting for new transmission lines and
connecting generation capacity to the grid, the most viable near-term
option is behind-the-meter,” Tim Fist and Arnab Datta wrote in a report
for the Institute for Progress,
<a href="https://ifp.org/future-of-ai-compute/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
technology and science policy think tank</u></a>. In other words, one
way to get around grid interconnection and intermittency issues is to
have your own power plant.
</p>
<p>
“The economics of developing the power on site don’t really hurt the
data center economics that much. These things are just really
profitable,” Carson Kearl, an analyst at Enverus, told me.
</p>
<p>
Some data centers have developed their own natural gas generation on
site, such as XAi’s cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, which
is<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musks-xai-data-center-adding-to-memphis-air-quality-problems-campaign-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>powered by gas generators</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
CoreWeave, meanwhile, is
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f4085e30-da81-40f0-8217-507268743f71" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the most talked-about and well-funded companies</u></a> in cloud
computing, with access to a huge number of chips made by Nvidia, the
leading designer of high-end processors, and which is also an investor
in CoreWeave. But the chips can only perform when they’re powered,
turning the data center business into a hunt for electricity wherever it
can be found.
</p>
<p>
“Access to reliable power could be a roadblock towards the timely
buildout” for a data center, Francois Poirier, the chief executive of TC
Energy, the Canadian pipeline company, told analysts on an earnings call
in August. “We’re seeing a shift in siting preferences from regions
where big telecom infrastructure is in place to regions where energy and
supply infrastructure is in place.”
</p>
<p>
CoreWeave, PSE&amp;G, Onyx, and Atlantic Power’s owner, I Squared
Capital, did not respond to requests for comment.
</p>
<p>
This situation has not come about for lack of effort on the part of the
several electricity markets that have been trying to get new natural gas
generation on the grid. PJM, for example, has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>been
working to entice new supply</u></a>, but even following a record
auction for power capacity that paid out billions to natural gas plants,
few producers have indicated their willingness to make large new
investments. Texas has established a multibillion-dollar loan fund to
provide low-cost financing to new natural gas plants.
</p>
<p>
While several large technology companies have announced their
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-x-energy-nuclear-deal" target="_self"><u>intention
to buy nuclear power</u></a> from refurbished or new plants, those deals
will take at least several years to actually get any new electrons on
the grid.
</p>
<p>
That leads data center developers like CoreWeave scrambling to find what
power they can. In interviews, the company’s chief strategy officer
Brian Venturo
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/coreweave-scrappy-cryptominer-multibillion-dollar-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>Wired</em></em></u></a> that they are avoiding Northern
Virginia’s “data center alley” precisely because it’s “a food fight to
get power.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of growing backlash in that market around power usage,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/what-it-really-takes-to-build-an-ai-datacenter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
told Bloomberg</u></a>. “We’re kind of siting our plants and markets
where our data centers and markets where we think the grid
infrastructure is capable of handling it.”
</p>
<p>
And what better place than where the power already is.<br/>

<h2 id="hydrogen-hubs-are-struggling.-why">Hydrogen Hubs Are Struggling.
Why?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTY4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk4NjMzN30.zV9XjA1-NwpK3OXaCwswubtuNtodkLMIrbTTqP8-8L8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Key projects for the Energy Department’s hydrogen hubs are dropping like
flies. And it’s really not obvious why.
</p>
<p>
Three hubs DOE selected for potential federal support have lost projects
that were linchpins. Industrial giant Fortescue is no longer publicly
committing to a hydro-powered hydrogen production plant proposed in
Washington state that was key to the Pacific Northwest hub. News of a
pause at the project was previously reported, but the company notably
declined to even say the project was still getting built when asked
about it this week.
</p>
<p>
“While Fortescue will continue to maintain a portfolio of other projects
for the future, our financial discipline always comes first. We will
never do projects that are not currently economically viable,” the
company said in a statement provided to me this morning.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile CNX, a natural gas company, has indefinitely put the kibosh on
a
<a href="https://investors.cnx.com/news-releases/2023/12-15-2023-211538125" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blue
hydrogen ammonia plant</u></a> in West Virginia crucial to the
Appalachian hydrogen hub known as ARCH2. Marathon Petroleum’s midstream
subsidiary MPLX also confirmed to me they’ve canceled a hydrogen storage
facility planned for that hub, and Chemours is no longer involved with
the hub either.
</p>
<p>
Another blue hydrogen ammonia plant in North Dakota crucial to a
different hub – known as the
<a href="https://undeerc.org/research/projects/heartland-h2-hub.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Heartland
hub</u></a> – has been canceled by Marathon and TC Energy.
</p>
<p>
In other words: a year after the Biden administration made
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/13/biden-harris-administration-announces-regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-to-drive-clean-manufacturing-and-jobs/" target="_blank">a
big announcement</a> about the seven hubs that could potentially receive
billions of dollars in government funding, almost half of them are
running into serious trouble.
</p>
<p>
The companies that have quietly pulled out or paused projects are laying
blame on implementation of the federal hydrogen production tax credit,
claiming rules enforcing the “three pillars” and carbon intensity
requirements are too onerous. Meanwhile critics of the hydrogen hubs are
seizing on project cancellations and delays to argue against their
construction outright; the Ohio River Valley Institute, an environmental
group opposed to the ARCH2 hydrogen hub, has received
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18102024/appalachian-hydrogen-hub-plan-struggles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
lot of press</u></a> in recent days for
<a href="https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/is-the-arch2-hydrogen-hub-coming-apart-sure-looks-like-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
report</u></a> claiming the hub is “coming apart.”
</p>
<p>
I’m already hearing whispers from industry insiders in D.C. who are
trying to spin these cancellations as evidence the credit implementation
has been too favorable to climate activists and is constraining growth
in the nascent hydrogen space.
</p>
<p>
But what’s really going on?
</p>
<p>
Conversations with experts and stakeholders indicate to me this could be
evidence of broader macroeconomic issues hitting the hydrogen industry,
from inflation pushing up the price of electrolyzers to the stubbornly
low price of natural gas. We saw this with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/plug-power-hydrogen-stamp-genesee" target="_self"><u>the
Plug Power project</u></a> in New York, which we were first to report
problems with. These market issues may be overpowering the subsidies and
demand-side benefits of the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation
Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
These hiccups may also be a calm before a storm of hydrogen investment
and a reshuffling of capital that’ll become more evident after the IRA’s
production tax credit is fully implemented with final regulations.
Perhaps it’ll take final rules to see
<a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
companies supportive</u></a> of the “three pillars” move more projects
forward.
</p>
<p>
It could also be a mixture of these things <em><em>and</em></em> other
factors, like issues with the specific sites companies had selected for
their plants.
</p>
<p>
No matter the cause for these hubs stuttering, these projects falling
out of the fold is a shock to no one, especially supporters of the
“three pillars” approach to the tax credit. Though it may indicate flaws
with a disorganized approach to the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not surprised if at the end of the day some of the many projects
supported by DOE are not viable in the end,” said Jesse Jenkins, an
assistant professor at Princeton University and expert in energy systems
engineering. In addition to co-hosting Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast,
Jenkins leads the REPEAT Project, which produced influential policy
analysis supporting the “three pillars” approach to Treasury’s
implementation of the hydrogen production tax credit.
</p>
<p>
Irrespective of the reasons, it’s important to remember that on some
level both industry and the Biden administration stumbled into this
mess. That’s because Congress passed the bipartisan infrastructure law
mandating the creation and financing of these hubs
<em><em>before</em></em> the IRA was even introduced. The infrastructure
law itself required DOE to start soliciting proposals for hub funding
mere months after it was enacted. This means the hub program was crafted
independent of a tax subsidy boosting supply.
</p>
<p>
The hubs may be lobbying for a specific version of the hydrogen
production credit to be implemented, as many D.C. lobbyists
<a href="https://www.hyvelocityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/H2Hubs-Letter-to-Treasury.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like
to point out</u></a>, but the program wasn’t referenced in the tax
credit’s statute either.
</p>
<p>
As Jenkins put it, any conflict between the hubs and tax credit
provisions is evidence “that reflects that many of the projects
[selected] are not compliant.”
</p>
<p>
Biden administration officials spoke to me for a half hour this morning
about the canceled projects on the condition of anonymity to candidly
discuss the tax credit and hubs. To them, this can be explained as the
process working as intended, and they emphasized how the credit and hub
are independent programs. They also expect more capital to be unleashed
after the credit is finalized, as companies who’ve supported the “three
pillars” get certainty to make final investment decisions.
</p>
<p>
The administration’s view sounded akin to the optimistic vision relayed
to me by Clean Air Task Force’s Conrad Schneider: “This is what progress
looks like. It’s slow, it’s steady. It’s not [a] steady state though.”
</p>
<p>
My take? This is further proof we live in a disorganized energy
transition. So far in The Fight, we’ve covered the struggles to get
projects built because of opposing forces at a grassroots level. That
same dynamic applies to the federal climate programs incentivizing a
switch from carbon-intensive business practices. And sometimes, there’ll
be tug-of-war competing interests between the climate programs
themselves.

Anguish, Offshore Wind Wailing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTYzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTkzNTY5M30.TFRVJAruFoeRTUz91VdySK5XaMFwzejpXmnEj0o4VUY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=886&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<strong>1. Douglas County, Kansas </strong>– A legal headache is
consuming Kansas Sky Energy Center, a 159-megawatt solar project
proposed by Savion and Evergy … and showcasing how “agri-voltaics” may
not be the community engagement panacea some in industry are praying
for, according to legal filings reviewed by Heatmap.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Douglas
<a href="https://www.dgcoks.gov/county-commission" target="_blank"><u>Board
of County Commissioners</u></a> approved the project earlier this year
<a href="https://flatlandkc.org/news-issues/douglas-county-commission-approves-massive-solar-project/" target="_blank"><u>unanimously</u></a>
in spite of a petition from nearly property owners to oppose the
project. After that, landowners and the small neighboring community of
Grant Township sued the county commissioners to invalidate the approval.
</li>
<li>
The litigation accuses the Board Chair Karen Willey of essentially
orchestrating the approval and the solar project’s agri-voltaics plans
without meaningful local consultation, per the most recent amended
complaint filed by the aggrieved community members.
</li>
<li>
The complaint gets ugly real fast, citing texts and emails to allege
some sort of conspiracy between Willey, Savion employees, and The Nature
Conservancy, the environmental nonprofit, which was brought in to assist
with the agri-voltaics plans.
</li>
<li>
“Commissioner Karen Willey, a well-known opponent of production farming
and a critic of the accepted farming principles that enable Kansas
farmers to feed the world,” states the complaint filed in August,
“orchestrated the request and approval process to fulfill her pre-set
personal agenda.”
</li>
<li>
Willey and the rest of the board have denied all of the wrongdoing
alleged in the suit and are fighting it vigorously.
</li>
<li>
Irrespective of the merits, this one’s a headache, and must be eating up
lots of time and money for developers and the local government.
Yesterday a federal judge sent the case to state court after a prolonged
fight over jurisdiction.
</li>
<li>
This can be a fraught place to develop solar, as NextEra Energy has
experienced with its
<a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2022/09/14/giant-solar-farm-joco-dgco/" target="_blank"><u>West
Gardner solar project</u></a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Worcester County, Maryland</strong> – We finally get to see
the contours of the legal strategy against the Maryland Offshore Wind
Project, after Ocean City and surrounding local business and government
officials filed their lawsuit last week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In their complaint, opponents primarily cite environmental protection
laws and issues like “segmenting” environmental impacts that are
“cumulative” under NEPA (i.e. looking at them separately instead of
together).
</li>
<li>
The lawsuit also argues the government failed to properly consider the
impacts of climate change on the wind project.
</li>
<li>
Ocean City and its allies are represented in the case by locally-based
attorney Bruce Bight of the D.C. law firm Marzulla, which is also
<a href="https://marzulla.com/blog/when-harms-are-all-over-the-map-massachusetts-wind-farms-threaten-marine-life-and-livelihoods-on-and-off-shore/" target="_blank"><u>representing
fishermen</u></a> fighting offshore wind in New England.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Barnstable County, Massachusetts </strong>– Another blow to
offshore wind came Friday in the coastal town of Barnstable where
leaders voted to oppose cable landings for Avangrid’s New England Wind 2
project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The town’s non-binding resolution opposing the cable landings came after
a citizens group waged a pressure campaign –
<a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2024/08/16/barnstable-speaks-town-council-save-greater-dowses-beach-superior-court-avangrid-new-england-wind-1/74797910007/" target="_blank"><u>including
litigation</u></a> – to make the town ditch a
<a href="https://tobweb.town.barnstable.ma.us/ParkCityWindDocuments/Side%20Agreement%20Relating%20to%20HCA%20(Executed%206.25.2024%20).pdf" target="_blank"><u>host
community agreement</u></a> with Avangrid.
</li>
<li>
Avangrid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Somewhere near Houston, Texas </strong>– The small city of
Katy rejected a 500-megawatt battery storage project proposed by Ochoa
Energy despite the community struggling with regular blackouts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
During the city council’s meeting
<a href="https://katytx.new.swagit.com/videos/317576" target="_blank"><u>last
week</u></a> on the project, city councilors discussed crafting their
own anti-storage moratorium and cited other communities with new
restrictions, including
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/escondido-california-battery-moratorium-aes" target="_self"><u>specifically
Escondido, California.<br/></u></a>
</li>
<li>
The rejection was at least partially based on fear. Katy City Councilor
Gina Hicks said she personally supported construction but local
opposition made it impossible for her to support the project as an
elected representative.
</li>
<li>
The vote against Ochoa’s proposal came after an uproar at another recent
public meeting on the project, per Hicks, who predicted “brownouts” and
“blackouts” without the project.
</li>
<li>
“Just know that we as a community chose this and I will represent what
the community wants versus what I feel is personally best for this
decision,” she said.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>1. Offshore wind lease win </strong>– Two companies, Avangrid
and Invenergy, purchased four of the eight leases up for grabs yesterday
at the first floating offshore wind sale in the Gulf of Maine, according
to the
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-holds-first-offshore-wind-lease-sale-gulf-maine" target="_blank">Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I’ve
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>previously
chronicled</u></a> how offshore wind is particularly vulnerable to the
whims of the federal government and how if Donald Trump wins the
presidency again, the entire U.S. sector could grind to a shrieking
halt.<br/>
</li>
<li>
That’s why, as my colleague Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/maine-offshore-wind-auction" target="_self"><u>noted</u></a>,
the fact any leases were purchased at all is a surprise sign that not
all momentum has stalled ahead of this consequential election.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“The fact that two developers took the leap now rather than waiting for
2028 – which is when the next lease sale in the Gulf of Maine is
scheduled – shows some level of confidence in the long-term prospects
for the industry,” she

<h2 id="the-ceo-of-ge-vernova-wants-less-talk-more-action">The CEO of GE
Vernova Wants Less Talk, More Action</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTM1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzgyNzgzNn0.cvb0hhAIL67YVFwLMgv_D2l_WAwUEWwGpMnQN612Kbw/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Last week at Greentown Labs’ startup summit in Boston I interviewed
Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova, the energy equipment manufacturing arm
of General Electric formerly known as GE Renewables and GE Power.
</p>
<p>
GE Vernova has been at the forefront of a tech and public relations
crisis in the offshore wind sector after one of the blades it
constructed for the Vineyard Wind farm collapsed into the Atlantic
Ocean. Last week, the company reported it found more issues with blades
and recorded $700 million in financial losses from offshore wind
contracts largely tied to blade issues.
</p>
<p>
So naturally, I asked him about this – and NIMBYs, and the Inflation
Reduction Act, and also about what gives him hope for the future. This
interview has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>These days there’s a lot of folks out there who a few years ago
were more optimistic than they are today given all kinds of industry
trends, policy trends … how would you characterize the pace of the
transition right now? Is it speeding up or slowing down? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I actually go into the room today more optimistic than I would’ve been
two years ago. I think at the end of the day what we need to think about
is, in the electric power system, we need growth to be able to innovate.
We’re about to get the most growth that we’ve had – the most load growth
in the U.S. – in multiple decades. That actually is an opportunity for
us to transform how things work. It’s a lot harder to do that in a flat
demand environment, and for the first time in a long time we don’t have
that anymore.
</p>
<p>
So I find it quite interesting when you have conversations about
<em><em>oh my gosh, the hyperscalers need a ton of electricity for data
centers, what is this going to do to the energy transition?
</em></em>Hyperscalers, as an example, are amazing customers who care
immensely about sustainability. They do need electrons tomorrow but
those are electrons they’re committed to decarbonizing over time. So I
like our chances now more than I would’ve two years ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How has your experience in wind informed your approach to
emerging technologies generally? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Well I think in a lot of these cases, this is an all-of-the-above energy
technology opportunity for us. We’re going to need a lot of different
technologies to solve our challenges and then the real question becomes
how do we develop products that can industrialize at scale. And that is
really at the heart of the challenge for the wind industry today.
</p>
<p>
The reality is there’s an incredible amount of innovation with wind. A
lot of accelerated larger products. And as they got larger and larger,
they got harder and harder to make, and the harder and harder they are
to make, the bigger the industry’s quality challenges. And at the end of
the day, if we produce products that ultimately don’t work, it doesn’t
electrify and decarbonize the world.
</p>
<p>
When I think about what we do in places like [a startup summit], the
technology is the start but it’s also simultaneously saying, <em><em>is
this something we can make at scale? </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you think we’re not going to be able to manufacture wind at
scale? </strong>
</p>
<p>
No, I think we’re definitely going to be able to do it. But I think the
industry has gone through such an incredible amount of growth fairly
quickly with different product variants that the industry struggled in
that regard. The availability of the global install base of wind
turbines from an industry perspective has gone down as the growth has
gone up. And that’s a bad equation. We need the availability of the
product to be working at the same static pace as we plan more and more
wind turbines. Do I think we can do that? I think we can. But something
I reference a lot is the risk of developing products and businesses on
PowerPoint economics versus actual engineering and manufacturing
discipline to make sure we can do things right the first time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I write a newsletter for Heatmap about conflicts in the energy
transition – local, state, federal – and I’ve covered conflicts over
wind projects, solar projects, battery storage. A trend I’ve seen,
especially within first-moving space, is one involving opposition.
Because people aren’t familiar with these technologies, it’s easier to
scaremonger or get people opposed. I’m wondering, how do you think
companies like yourself are doing at handling community engagement and
communities’ reception to emerging technologies? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think what’s critical here is that we all are a catalyst to a
conversation. I think the challenge we have sometimes with the energy
transition is we actually let the conversation go on for too long.
</p>
<p>
I actually think the debate is crucial. The debate within communities
where there are trades being made – for example, for space or resources
— are critical. But the adult conversation is how we converge.
Ultimately you need to govern those conversations, make decisions, and
go. And today I don’t know if that adult conversation happens fast
enough.
</p>
<p>
<strong> For anyone here involved in deployment, are we in a place where
people aren’t willing to go? I know at least in some parts of this
country, that’s certainly the case. I write about NIMBYs all the time.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Well I think – and again, we need people to be heard, we need
communities to be heard – projects do take longer to get done today.
That’s a dynamic when you think about industrializing products at scale,
a lot of products within the electric power system need to be connected
to the zero-carbon power sources that we’re creating. That connection
does require new transmission lines to get the electrons to where
they’re ultimately needed. That is a long, drawn-out process today in
the U.S. It’s longer in our U.S. markets than it is in Europe, it’s
longer than it is in Asia. That doesn’t mean the conversation shouldn’t
happen, because if a transmission line goes through a community that
ultimately isn’t benefiting from that transmission line, we’ve got to
solve that problem. But the country needs the transmission lines,
because without it we’re not going to decarbonize the electric power
system.
</p>
<p>
In my mind this is less about whether we’re having the debates. It’s
more about how do we have them quicker and then make decisions and go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Given the timetables for developing a transmission line or
developing a wind farm, those can be decadal timetables. Next year we’re
looking at Congress potentially writing a new tax bill. How bankable is
the Inflation Reduction Act in a decadal investment landscape? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Two thoughts on that.
</p>
<p>
First, it can’t take decades to build a transmission line or a wind
farm. I can tell you, as one of the biggest players in the space, it
sure as heck doesn’t take that long to physically build them. It takes
that long because the conversation takes too long before we push go.
That’s the challenge. We can do this much quicker, we just have to do
it.
</p>
<p>
Now, on the Inflation Reduction Act – and there are many elements of the
Inflation Reduction Act – I’m certain that with the next administration,
regardless of who is in it, they’ll scrutinize all the decisions the
last administration made. That’s the beauty of our government. All that
said, when it comes to most elements of the Inflation Reduction Act that
are tied to creating jobs, manufacturing growth, U.S. competitiveness,
energy security – it’s becoming very, very clear that building out and
really transforming the electric power system in the U.S. supports all
of those priorities. Those are things that both sides of the aisle
support.
</p>
<p>
When I look at the things we’re investing in — and we’re investing
heavily into expanding U.S. factories to grow the wind industry, to grow
further into serving the transmission and switchgear market — we’re not
hesitating one bit because of the bankability risk of our democracy. We
think both sides of the aisle are going to support things that are
aligned with competitiveness, innovation, jobs, and U.S. national
security. And that’s what we’re investing in every day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So, what gives you hope? You’re certainly brimming with it.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re in this every day. We added 29 gigawatts of new power globally
last year. Forty-four percent of it was in developing countries. That
new 29 gigawatts of power we added to the grid was about 25% cleaner
than what the grid is in totality and we see a very clear pathway to add
a lot more gigawatts every year, and for it to be even cleaner than what
we delivered this year or last year. We know how to do this.
</p>
<p>
I come into rooms like this and listen to the last 20 minutes of
[startup] presentations and I say to myself, <em><em>okay, we’ve got a
lot of young companies that are working on really important stuff. Do
they know exactly how to industrialize their product yet at the level
that it can make an impact? </em></em>Maybe not. <em><em>Do they have
the customer reach they’re going to need to accelerate the commercial
momentum? </em></em>Probably not in all cases. Guess what: Those are
things Vernova can help with. That’s why we like hanging out in a room
like this. There’s a lot of companies that operate in this building
every day in which that art of the possible is exciting. There’s a lot
of other buildings in the country, in the world, where it’s hard to not
have a kick in our step. So this is there for the taking.
</p>
<p>
I’d rather go at it with that mindset than with the alternative because
if I go at it with the alternative, I’ll definitely let down my kids.
I’ve got a 12 and 10 year old. They already believe that this is their
generation’s greatest challenge. So are we going to take it on with
optimism and go after it, or the alternative? And I do think that’s an
important point I want to hit on is, something I shared with my broad
leadership team: I do think at times, as it relates to energy innovation
with climate change and the energy transition, we can lean into
conversations with pessimism. And I don’t think that helps our industry.
</p>
<p>
If I do a compare-contrast with the tech industry on the West Coast,
where I’m spending a lot more time now, they’re a lot more optimistic
about things they have no idea how to actually make a reality. But the
optimism is there. And that optimism can sometimes be half the battle.
So are we going to scare everybody? Or are we going to frame up what we
know how to do, be honest about what we don’t know how to do, and go
after it?
</p>
<p>
<strong>I’ll tell you, any time an oil rig fails, no one is having a
conversation about the technology. Is this a public perception problem
and a media problem with trade-off denial? Is there some sort of double
standard going on in the energy transition space versus fossil fuel
space? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think that is the case. I think we want to hold to the standard
the media and the communities are expecting of us. There [are] no
trade-offs for safety and quality. And when things don’t work, whether
it be a solar farm, a wind turbine, a transformer goes down, I’m not
crying in my beer over those communities pushing on whether the industry
is good enough.
</p>
<p>
I think a similar thing happens in the fossil fuel industry when things
don’t work, but I don’t want a different bar. I don’t think this is
about having a different set of expectations for what we need to
deliver. We talk every day about the fact that if this industry is going
to thrive, it needs to start every single day with safety and quality at
the forefront of what we do. Delivery comes next and that’s where I talk
about industrializing things at scale. We don’t really have time for
hobbies. These things need to be built at scale. And then the economics
need to ultimately work because if the economics don’t work and we push
this price to everyone with just exponentially higher electricity
prices, that’s not going to work either.
</p>
<p>
But you can’t start with the economics. You can’t start with whether you
can make it at scale. First it has to be safe and it has to be high
quality. And I actually think communities, the media, investors holding
that bar to every element of the renewables industry is a step in the
right direction.

<h2 id="us-detects-h5n1-bird-flu-in-pig-for-first-time">US detects H5N1
bird flu in pig for first time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO, ILLINOIS — H5N1 bird flu had been confirmed in a pig in a
backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in
the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pigs represent a particular concern for the spread of bird flu
because they can become co-infected with bird and human viruses, which
could swap genes to form a new, more dangerous virus that can more
easily infect humans.</p>
<p>The USDA said there is no risk to the nation’s pork supply from the
Oregon case and that the risk to the public from bird flu remains
low.</p>
<p>Pigs were the source of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009-2010, and have
been implicated as the source of others, said Richard Webby, a St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and
birds for the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The finding of the virus in a small farm makes the pig infection less
of a concern than if it had been detected in a commercial pig farm, he
said.</p>
<p>“I think it probably doesn’t increase the risk much, but surely, if
this virus starts transmitting in pigs, that absolutely increases the
risk,” he said.</p>
<p>The Oregon farm has been quarantined, and other animals there,
including sheep and goats, are under surveillance, the USDA said.</p>
<p>Pigs and poultry on the farm were culled to prevent the spread of the
virus and enable additional testing of the swine, the USDA said. Tests
are still pending for two of the pigs, the agency said.</p>
<p>The swine case originated with wild birds and not from a poultry or
dairy farm, a USDA spokesperson said. Wild bird migration has carried
bird flu to poultry flocks and cattle herds.</p>
<p>The case was one factor that prompted the USDA to broaden its bird
flu surveillance to include nationwide bulk milk testing, which the
agency announced on Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told
Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>“While it’s a different variation of the virus and it is tied to wild
birds, it is a factor to make sure that we understand and appreciate
exactly where the virus is in dairy and in bovine,” he said.</p>
<p>The pigs on the Oregon farm were not intended for the commercial food
supply, the USDA said.</p>
<p>The agency said that poultry and swine on the backyard farm shared
water sources, housing and equipment, which have all served as pathways
for transmitting the virus between animals in other states.</p>
<p>The detection is a warning for pig farmers to be on the lookout for
further infections, said Marie Culhane, a professor of veterinary
population medicine at the University of Minnesota who has researched
flu viruses in swine.</p>
<p>“People need to start increasing their plans to deal with it if it
should happen in another herd and another herd,” Culhane said. “Pigs are
just really good at picking up influenza viruses.”</p>
<p>This year, 36 people have tested positive for bird flu as the virus
has spread to nearly 400 dairy herds. All but one of the people were
farm workers who had known contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry
birds in the nation’s worst-ever bird flu outbreak.</p>

<h2 id="concerns-about-elon-musk-russias-putin-not-fading-yet">Concerns
about Elon Musk, Russia’s Putin not fading yet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has been talking on a
consistent basis with Russian President Vladimir Putin are still
reverberating among current and former U.S. officials, almost a week
after news of the conversations first surfaced.</p>
<p>Musk, who owns electric car maker Tesla and the X social media
platform, also owns SpaceX, a commercial spaceflight company that has
numerous contracts with the U.S. government, doing work for the
Department of Defense and U.S. space agency NASA.</p>
<p>Some of that work is so sensitive that the United States has given
Musk high-level security clearances due to his knowledge of the
programs, raising concerns among some that top secret U.S. information
and capabilities could be at risk.</p>
<p>According to current and former U.S., European and Russian officials
who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, such concerns may be
warranted.</p>
<p>During one conversation, those officials said, Putin allegedly asked
Musk not to activate Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary that provides
satellite internet services, over Taiwan as a favor to China.</p>
<p>“I think it should be investigated,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson
told the Semafor World Economy Summit on Friday, a day after The Journal
published its report.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that that story is true,” Nelson said, adding, if it
is, “I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the
Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.”</p>
<p>Russia and Musk deny frequent calls</p>
<p>Musk has previously denied frequent calls with Putin. In 2022, Musk
said he had spoken to the Russian leader just once, but The Journal said
there have been repeated conversations since then.</p>
<p>Musk has not commented or responded to the Journal article on X.
Russia has also denied there have been frequent conversations between
Putin and Musk.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has so far declined to refute or confirm the
allegations.</p>
<p>“We have seen the reporting from The Wall Street Journal but cannot
corroborate the veracity of those reports,” Defense Department
spokesperson Sue Gough told VOA in an email late Friday.</p>
<p>“[We] would refer you to Mr. Musk to speak to his private
communications,” Gough said, adding that, by law, the department does
not comment on the details or status of anyone’s security clearance.</p>
<p>“We expect everyone who has been granted a security clearance,
including contractors, to follow the prescribed procedures for reporting
foreign contacts,” she said.</p>
<p>Former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to VOA said the reported
conversations, since confirmed by other U.S. news organizations citing
their own confidential sources, raise significant questions.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that Russia is cultivating many possible channels
of influence in the United States and other Western countries,” said
Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown
University.</p>
<p>“Russia would regard a wealthy and influential business mogul such as
Musk as potentially a highly useful channel and thus a relationship
worth nurturing,” he said.</p>
<p>Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior
director of the White House Situation Room, is also wary.</p>
<p>“It does get the spider-sense tingling,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>“If the reports of Musk’s repeated conversations with Vladimir Putin
are true, I would definitely have some concerns,” Pfeiffer said. “Russia
under Putin will cultivate support wherever it can be bought, cajoled or
coerced.</p>
<p>“Putin has equal opportunity security services that will take
advantage of any opportunity to get foreign business leaders to
influence their governments to align with Russian interests,” he
said.</p>
<p>Concerns don’t equal wrongdoing</p>
<p>Former officials like Pillar and Pfeiffer, though, caution there is a
difference between concerns and actual wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Other former officials note that even if Musk engaged in
conversations that could make some in government uncomfortable, just
having those conversations is not necessarily illegal.</p>
<p>“Americans are allowed to talk to essentially whomever they want,”
said a former national security prosecutor, who spoke to VOA on the
condition of anonymity. “There’s no inherent limitation.”</p>
<p>And in the case of a high-profile individual who oversees companies
with global reach, conversations with foreign officials could be
unavoidable.</p>
<p>“For a businessman, there may be commercially legitimate reasons to
have those communications,” the former prosecutor said. “It’s when a
businessman is having those communications, perhaps for political
reasons or even proto-diplomatic reasons, that it gets probably more
concerning from a counterintelligence perspective.”</p>
<p>There also may not be any legal issues with a potential failure by
someone like Musk to voluntarily disclose conversations with foreign
leaders. Hiding such conversations when asked about them, however, could
wade into criminal territory.</p>
<p>Still, given the value the U.S. gets from Musk’s companies, U.S.
officials may feel like they have little recourse.</p>
<p>“It is one of those unfair things in life that if the government has
a unique need for you, you can get away with more and still get a
security clearance,” the former prosecutor said. “Someone who has unique
value is going to get more accommodation.”</p>

<h2 id="what-does-elon-musk-want-from-trump">What Does Elon Musk Want
From Trump?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDAyMDM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTg5NTQ3M30.mn6AuMrnDTSAzue88hJwX1CxxNYetXO28OoHRDQw_gM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
At a recent rally for Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Howard
Lutnick, the head of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, took the stage
together and
<a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-government-spending-budget-biden-1851682623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contemplated</u></a>
the federal budget. “How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted
$6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?” Lutnick asked. “I think we could do
at least $2 trillion,” Musk said, to the cheers of the crowd. “Your
money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is
going to fix that.”
</p>
<p>
This idea — that there is $2 trillion of “waste” in the yearly federal
budget that could be eliminated if only someone like Musk were given the
power to do it — exemplifies his orientation toward government. It’s
brash, shockingly ambitious, contemptuous of what most Americans need,
and fed by Musk’s combination of arrogance and ignorance. And it will
never happen — not because the deep state will prevent it, but because
Musk, while brilliant in some ways, is not smart enough to know what he
doesn’t know.
</p>
<p>
Tempting as it is to take seriously Trump’s proposal for Musk to head up
a new cabinet department or a commission on government efficiency (it
has been described both ways) if Trump becomes president, the idea that
Musk will spend his days in a government building in Washington poring
over budget details is laughable. Plus, we already have a department of
efficiency; it’s called the
<a href="https://www.gao.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Government
Accountability Office</u></a>, and it does excellent work. But Musk does
stand to have extraordinary influence in a Trump administration. So when
it comes to policy, what does he actually want?
</p>
<p>
To start, let’s do some math. Without going too deep into it, if you add
up Social Security, Medicare, military spending, veterans’ benefits, and
interest on debt in
<a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts0924.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fiscal 2024 budget</u></a> — none of which will be cut — you get $4.4
trillion. That leaves $2.25 trillion, of which Musk thinks he could cut
$2 trillion. That, in turn, would mean eliminating almost everything the
federal government does, from controlling the border to issuing
passports to running national parks to medical research to federal
prisons to food inspections to … you get the idea.
</p>
<p>
Also in that $2.25 trillion is, of course, the money the federal
government spends on the energy transition, something Musk doesn’t seem
to have much enthusiasm for. It isn’t that he has embraced Trump’s
climate denialism, but he also doesn’t talk much about
<em><em>government’s</em></em> role in reducing emissions.
</p>
<p>
This represents a shift: When Joe Biden took office, Musk
<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/25/exclusive-elon-musk-tells-fortune-hes-super-fired-up-about-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>,
“I’m super fired up that the new administration is focused on climate.”
Biden followed through on his pledges in both regulation and
legislation, but Musk was less enthusiastic as time went on, and
eventually embraced Trump wholeheartedly, despite the latter’s promise
to undo essentially everything Biden has accomplished on climate change.
</p>
<p>
Tesla has been
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-embraces-trump-scorns-subsidies-tesla-still-lobbies-us-benefits-2024-08-12/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quietly
lobbying</u></a> to maintain subsidies for electric vehicles and in
favor of regulations that could phase out the production of internal
combustion cars, even as the candidate for whom Musk is spending tens of
millions of dollars promises to eliminate those policies. But he’s not
trying to change Trump’s mind, at least not publicly. On an earnings
call with shareholders earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/12/musk-trump-advice-climate-change-00173411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Musk
said</u></a> that if Trump keeps his promise to repeal the Inflation
Reduction Act, it would hurt Tesla “slightly,” but “long term, it
probably actually helps,” since it would be “devastating for our
competitors.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, Musk may want to address climate change, but that goal
will always take a back seat to what’s good for Elon Musk — and what’s
good for Musk just happens to be good policy, or so he seems to think.
This is an occupational hazard for billionaires, who are inevitably
surrounded by sycophants eager to tell them that any brain fart that
comes tumbling out of their mouths is the height of wisdom.
</p>
<p>
This tendency shows up in Musk’s views on just about everything else,
too. Like many a dilettante — albeit one with his own social media
platform and 200 million followers there — Musk occasionally dips his
thinking-emoji into policy issues without bothering to learn about what
they actually entail, like
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/09/elon-musk-social-security-cuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
warning</u></a> that Social Security is all but doomed. He worries a
great deal about underpopulation, which few experts think is
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/health/elon-musk-population-collapse-wellness/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>really
a problem</u></a>; his solution seems to be to
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elon-musk-reportedly-offered-sperm-163849936.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>distribute
his own sperm</u></a> as widely as possible.
</p>
<p>
But the most likely places where Musk will exercise influence in a
second Trump presidency are not his grand notions of a remade American
society, but rather in his own relationship with government. That
largely means two things: He would like government to give him more
money, and he would also like it to get out of his way.
</p>
<p>
On the first point, Musk is already a significant beneficiary of federal
contracts. As <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> recently
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>documented</u></a>,
Musk’s “companies were promised $3 billion across nearly 100 different
contracts last year with 17 federal agencies.” How handy it would be if
he were in charge of rejiggering federal spending! But on the flip side,
“His companies have been targeted in at least 20 recent investigations
or reviews, including over the safety of his Tesla cars and the
environmental damage caused by his rockets.” In a second Trump term —
especially one in which the architects of Project 2025 will no doubt be
busily reconfiguring the government to place nearly absolute power in
the hands of the president — Trump could easily repay the nine figures
Musk has spent to get him elected by making all those investigations
disappear.
</p>
<p>
Musk is also counting on the courts to make it easier for him to treat
his workers however he likes. He has repeatedly
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-forced-workers-sign-illegal-severance-agreements-us-agency-claims-2024-03-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clashed</u></a>
with the National Labor Relations Board, and SpaceX is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-new-spacex-opinion-nlrb-case-has-ominous-hints-federal-agencies-2024-07-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suing</u></a>
to effectively have the entire NLRB declared unconstitutional. (Other
anti-union companies including Amazon and Starbucks are
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-trader-joe-amazon-law-205755137.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking</u></a>
the same outcome.) Trump has publicly
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/uaw-hits-trump-musk-federal-labor-charges-union-busting-comments-rcna166403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>praised</u></a>
Musk for firing striking workers, which is illegal; and while it appears
Trump was referring to Musk
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firing</u></a>
most of the staff of Twitter, who were not actually on strike, their
shared
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/business/tesla-union-uaw-strike/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contempt</u></a>
for collective bargaining and worker rights is amply clear.
</p>
<p>
That Musk is an egomaniac is barely disputable, so it’s not surprising
that he believes government will either be a tool in his hands or the
destroyer of worlds, with no in-between. “While I have many concerns
about a potential Kamala regime,” he recently
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1837908705683059166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tweeted</u></a>,
“the bureaucracy currently choking America to death is guaranteed to
grow under a Democratic Party administration. This would destroy the
Mars program and doom humanity.” Apparently, only by giving Musk
whatever he wants can we avoid extinction.
</p>
<p>
The truth is that if Harris wins, Elon Musk will be just fine, and so
will humanity. The big difference will be that Musk won’t be able to
pick up the phone and tell the president what to do. But I’m sure he
will react to that with all the maturity and thoughtfulness we’ve come
to expect from him.

airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic
State militants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in
Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command
said Wednesday. </p>
<p>The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday
evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group.
The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi
forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. </p>
<p>Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a
threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years
ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of
large swaths of the two countries. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt
the group’s ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against
civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were
no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.</p>

id="harris-promises-to-represent-all-americans-after-biden-garbage-remark">Harris
promises to ‘represent all Americans’ after Biden ‘garbage’ remark</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris said she disagrees “with any criticism of
people based on who they vote for,” reacting after U.S. President Joe
Biden’s reference to Donald Trump’s supporters and “garbage.”</p>
<p>“I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for
me,” the vice president said.</p>
<p>Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, made the comment to
reporters as she prepared to campaign in three states. Her words were an
attempt to blunt the controversy over Biden’s rhetoric with less than a
week until the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>The tumult began Tuesday night around the time that Harris was
delivering a unifying message in a speech near the White House. Inside
the building, Biden was criticizing Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden
rally, where a comedian described Puerto Rico as an “island of
garbage.”</p>
<p>“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His
demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,” Biden
said in a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto
Latino. “It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything
we’ve been.”</p>
<p>Biden and the White House rushed to explain that the president was
talking about the rhetoric on stage, not Trump’s supporters themselves.
But Republicans seized on Biden’s comments, claiming they were an echo
of the time when Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nominee against
Trump in 2016, said half of Trump’s supporters belong to a “basket of
deplorables.”</p>
<p>In attacking Biden, and by extension, Harris, Republicans are
glossing over Trump’s own history of insulting and demonizing rhetoric,
such as calling the United States a “garbage can for the world” or
describing political opponents as “the enemy within.” Trump has also
described Harris as a “stupid person” and “lazy as hell,” and he’s
questioned whether she was on drugs.</p>
<p>Trump has also refused demands to apologize for the comment about
Puerto Rico at his rally, acknowledging “somebody said some bad things”
but “I can’t imagine it’s a big deal.”</p>
<p>Political attack lines have a history of occasionally boomeranging
back on people who use them. For example, Ohio Senantor JD Vance, now
Trump’s running mate, once described Democrats as beholden to “a bunch
of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the
choices that they’ve made.”</p>
<p>Vance’s three-year-old comments were resurfaced once he became the
vice presidential nominee, energizing Harris supporters who repurposed
the label as a point of pride on shirts and bumper stickers — much like
Trump’s supporters once cheerfully branded themselves as
“deplorables.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim
Walz, downplayed Biden’s comments in television interviews.</p>
<p>He told “CBS Mornings” that Biden “was very clear that he’s speaking
about the rhetoric we heard,” not the supporters themselves.</p>
<p>Walz made a similar comment on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” where he
emphasized that Democrats’ inclusive message.</p>
<p>“Let’s be very clear, the vice president and I have made it
absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,” he said.
“Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end.”</p>

<h2 id="us-cracks-down-on-russias-sanctions-evasion-in-fresh-action">US
cracks down on Russia’s sanctions evasion in fresh action</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday imposed curbs on hundreds
of targets in fresh action against Russia, taking aim at sanctions
circumvention in a signal that the U.S. is committed to countering
evasion.</p>
<p>The action, taken by the U.S. Treasury and State departments, imposed
sanctions on nearly 400 entities and people from over a dozen countries,
according to statements from the Treasury and State departments.</p>
<p>The action was the most concerted push so far against third-country
evasion, a State Department official told Reuters. It included sanctions
on dozens of Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian companies, the most from
those countries to be hit in one package so far, according to the
official.</p>
<p>Also hit with sanctions were targets in Russia, the United Arab
Emirates, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The action comes as Washington has sought to curb Russia’s evasion of
the sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has
killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble.</p>
<p>The U.S. has repeatedly warned against supplying Russia with Common
High Priority Items — advanced components that include microelectronics
deemed by the U.S. and European Union as likely to be used for Russia’s
war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“This should send a serious message to both the governments and the
private sectors of these countries that the U.S. government is committed
to countering the evasion of our sanctions against Russia and to
continue putting pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine,” the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 274 targets, while the
State Department designated more than 120. The U.S. Commerce Department
added 40 companies and research institutions to a trade restriction list
over their alleged support of the Russian military.</p>
<p>“The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive
action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and
technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war
against Ukraine,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the
statement.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said Wednesday’s action was designed
to signal the U.S. would act against Indian companies if progress were
not made through communication.</p>
<p>“With India, we have been very direct and blunt with them about the
concerns we have about what we see as sort of emerging trends in that
country that we want to stop before they get too far down the road,” the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.</p>
<p>India-based Futrevo was among the companies targeted by the State
Department, which accused it of being involved in the supply of
high-priority items to the Russia-based manufacturer of Orlan
drones.</p>
<p>The Treasury also targeted Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited,
which it said since 2023 has sent hundreds of shipments of
U.S.-trademarked technology to Russia, totaling tens of millions of
dollars.</p>
<p>A second senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday
that more than 70% of the high-priority goods getting to Russia was from
China, more than an estimated $22 billion worth since the start of the
war.</p>
<p>“That’s over 13 times the next largest supplier,” the official said,
which as of the end of 2023 was Turkey.</p>
<p>Among those targeted Wednesday were Hong Kong and China-based
companies involved in the shipment of tens of millions of dollars’ worth
of high-priority items to Russia-based companies or end-users, the State
and Treasury departments said.</p>
<p>The U.S. also took actions on a variety of entities supporting
Russia’s Arctic project, which is 60% owned by Russia’s Novatek and was
to become Russia’s largest liquefied natural gas plant.</p>
<p>Novatek has been forced to scale back Arctic, which had been planned
to reach an eventual output of 19.8 million metric tons per year,
following a raft of U.S. sanctions starting in 2023 with additional
measures in August and September.</p>
<p>But the U.S. held back from using an executive order signed by
President Joe Biden last year that threatened penalties for financial
institutions that help Russia circumvent sanctions. The senior
administration official said banking sectors had taken notice of the
authority and sort of moved into compliance.</p>

The private payroll company ADP reported that a lot more people than

until Friday. But this is new evidence that the American jobs machine is
still putting people to work. We dig in. Plus, a look at Google’s strong

Takeaways From an Actually Pretty Solid Quarter for EV Sales</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg4ODYzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjcxMjEyN30.2WRSzLnV0-itcjDfJEWYFsgALKNdf2s33l1c5CbDFZ4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Stop me if you’ve heard this one already, but the supposed EV sales
slump isn’t real. The overall growth rate has slowed somewhat, crushing
any fantasy that America would accelerate to mostly electric driving in
just a few years. But electric vehicles sales have been steadily rising
amid a negative narrative, and they
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rose</u></a>
yet again in the third quarter of 2024.
</p>
<p>
Carmakers sold 346,309 of them from July to September, a 5% increase
over the second quarter of this year and an 11% jump year-over-year. EVs
reached 8.9% of all vehicles sold in America in the third quarter,
prompting Cox Automotive (which owns Kelley Blue Book) to opine that 10%
looks well within reach.
</p>
<p>
A look inside the numbers behind the news tells us a few important
things about the state of EVs.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Somebody out there loves the Cybertruck
</h3>
<p>
A lightning rod on wheels, the Cybertruck became a focal point for the
anger and contempt lots of very online people feel toward Elon Musk and
his support for Donald Trump. But as I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-gmc-hummer" target="_self"><u>noted</u></a>
a year ago for Heatmap, plenty of people want this car — either out of
genuine affection for what it is and what it can do, or for the
political statement they can make by owning one.
</p>
<p>
The numbers don’t lie. Despite a slow start, Tesla sold 16,692
Cybertrucks during the third quarter. That made it the number three EV
in America behind Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3. The Cybertruck’s
emergence, combined with better sales by a refreshed Model 3, helped to
stop a slide at Tesla earlier this year caused by falling sales of the
aging Models S, X, and Y.
</p>
<p>
As Tesla goes, so goes today’s EV market. Its slump in 2024 had hampered
the growth of the industry at large; a rumored update to the
industry-leading Model Y would be a shot in the arm for everybody. Yet
even with Tesla stabilizing, Elon Musk’s dominance isn’t what it once
was. The company’s market share, which hovered in the 70% range in 2019
and 2020, has fallen below 50%. With a growing slate of competitors, it
may never cross above that threshold again.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Trending up: GM
</h3>
<p>
Korean brands Hyundai and Kia had been the non-Tesla
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self"><u>success
story</u></a> of the past year-plus, with American EV shoppers falling
in love with the quirky Hyundai Ioniq 5 in particular. But General
Motors seized second place in Q3 as some of its plans finally came to
fruition. Chevy sold nearly 8,000 Blazer EVs and almost 10,000 Equinox
EVs last quarter. That latter figure is particularly impressive given
that the $35,000 base-level Equinox, which could fall below $30,000
after incentives, didn’t hit the market until October. The Cadillac
Lyric found a niche. Even the preposterous GMC Hummer EV saw a big sales
bump.
</p>
<p>
GM’s solid numbers don’t include the remarkable success of its
partnership with Honda, who borrowed GM’s Ultium platform to build its
first American EV, the Prologue. That vehicle sold 12,644 in the third
quarter, outpacing GM’s own EV crossovers. (Perhaps the legion of loyal
Honda buyers in America were just waiting for the brand to sell them an
electric car.)
</p>
<p>
Chevy and Honda’s success came at the expense of some brands whose
electric crossovers aren’t quite so new and exciting anymore. The Ioniq
5 dropped a tiny bit compared to the third quarter of 2023, just 0.5%.
However, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E dropped by nearly 10% year over year,
while the Volkswagen ID.4 tumbled by 57.8%.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Treading water: Ford
</h3>
<p>
Speaking of Ford, it wasn’t all bad news for GM’s rival. Ford’s EV
division did
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/28/ford-tops-q3-earnings-but-ev-losses-weigh-profits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>better</u></a>
than Wall Street expected. Overall sales actually rose, with gains from
the E-transit van and F-150 Lightning pickup truck balancing out falling
numbers from the Mustang Mach-E. Even so, Ford is losing billions of
dollars on its electric vehicles. The blue oval brand faces a double
challenge: It needs to get a new EV on sale to juice sales while
figuring out how to dramatically cut manufacturing costs.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Incentives matter
</h3>
<p>
Watch any car commercial and you’ll be reminded that incentives aren’t
the sole domain of EVs. Brands and dealerships offer all kinds of
rebates and discounts to move gasoline cars off the lot. Yet because of
the size of the federal and state tax credits and rebates for buying
electric, those incentives retain an outsized impact on sales. Cox
points out that incentives made up 12% of the average price of an EV
sold in the third quarter of this year, compared to just above 7% for
other kinds of cars.
</p>
<p>
What’s especially dramatic, though, is the incentive-driven rise of the
leased EV. Overall, Americans lease just over 20% of their new cars, not
far from where the figure stood two years ago. At the end of 2022, less
than 10% of Americans who got a new EV leased it. But in December of
that year, the federal government announced many EVs that weren’t
ineligible for tax credits when purchased outright
<em><em>would</em></em> be eligible for those incentives if people
leased them. Cox’s
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-4.06.25%E2%80%AFPM.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a>
paints a stark picture, showing leases rocketing from about 9% to 43% of
EV sales.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Luxury brands are leading the way
</h3>
<p>
In their own EV makeup, that is. There are six car brands that have 10%
of their U.S. sales or more from EVs: Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Audi,
and Cadillac — luxury brands all — are five of them. (The other is
Mini.)
</p>
<p>
This makes perfect sense, of course. Luxury brands sell fewer vehicles
overall, so it’s easier for EVs to make a big dent in sales. They sell
expensive cars, which makes it easier for buyers to swallow the higher
cost of EVs. Their drivers have always been more likely to lease cars,
even before leasing EVs in particular became so appealing.
</p>
<p>
In sum, it means that the luxury car brands — while selling fewer
overall EVs than Chevy and Honda will eventually sell — will be the
first to experience what it’s like for a legacy car brand when the
scales tip to more EVs than not.

id="supreme-court-allows-virginia-to-resume-purge-of-voter-registrations">Supreme
Court allows Virginia to resume purge of voter registrations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to
resume its purge of voter registrations that the state says is aimed at
stopping people who are not U.S. citizens from voting. </p>
<p>The justices, over the dissents of the three liberal justices,
granted an emergency appeal from Virginia’s Republican administration
led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The court provided no rationale for its
action, which is typical in emergency appeals. </p>
<p>The justices acted on Virginia’s appeal after a federal judge found
that the state illegally purged more than 1,600 voter registrations in
the past two months. A federal appeals court had previously allowed the
judge’s order to remain in effect. </p>
<p>Such voting is rare in American elections, but the specter of
immigrants voting illegally has been a main part of the political
messaging this year from former President Donald Trump and other
Republicans. </p>
<p>Trump had criticized the earlier ruling, calling it “a totally
unacceptable travesty” on social media. </p>
<p>“Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote,” Trump wrote. </p>
<p>The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued the
state earlier in October, arguing that Virginia election officials,
acting on an executive order issued in August by Youngkin were striking
names from voter rolls in violation of federal election law. </p>
<p>The National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day “quiet period”
ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls so that legitimate
voters are not removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or
last-minute mistakes that cannot be quickly corrected. </p>
<p>Youngkin issued his order on Aug. 7, the 90th day before the
election. It required daily checks of data from the state Department of
Motor Vehicles against voter rolls to identify people who are not U.S.
citizens. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles said elections officials still
could remove names on an individualized basis, but not through a
systematic purge. Court records indicated that at least some of those
whose registrations were removed are U.S. citizens. </p>
<p>Giles had ordered the state to notify affected voters and local
registrars by Wednesday that the registrations have been restored. </p>
<p>Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. </p>
<p>In a similar lawsuit in Alabama, a federal judge this month ordered
the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been
deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that
case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made
inactive were actually legally registered citizens.</p>

id="us-economy-grew-at-a-solid-2.8-pace-last-quarter-on-strength-of-consumer-spending">US
economy grew at a solid 2.8% pace last quarter on strength of consumer
spending</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from
July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the
weight of still-high interest rates. </p>
<p>Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross
domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services —
did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But
the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans
assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential
race. </p>
<p>Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic
activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8%
in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third
quarter’s growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate. </p>
<p>On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a
drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as
offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged. </p>
<p>The report is the first of three estimates the government will make
of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy has
continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the
Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation.
Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a
recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and
consumers still spending. </p>
<p>In a sign that the nation’s households, whose purchases drive most of
the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday
that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since
March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the
next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed
that question in July 2022. </p>
<p>At the same time, the nation’s once-sizzling job market has lost some
momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job
openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level
since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs
a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record
604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession,
377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. </p>
<p>On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the
economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably
have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene
and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which
temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. </p>
<p>Wednesday’s report contained some encouraging news on inflation. The
Fed’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption
expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last
quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in
more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices,
so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June
quarter. </p>
<p>Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far
exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans
and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris’ prospects in her
race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists
have suggested, though, that Trump’s policy proposals, unlike Harris’,
would worsen inflation. </p>
<p>At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough
with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the
slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half
percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four
years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another
rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. </p>
<p>The central bank’s policymakers have also signaled that they expect
to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in
November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and
two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed’s rate cuts, over time,
will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses.</p>

York media outlet connects immigrants with news and resources</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a drizzly day in New York’s Chinatown, journalist April
Xu suggested stopping at a bakery for a snack. </p>
<p>“But not Fay Da,” she said, referring to a bakery on the nearby
corner. </p>
<p>Xu doesn’t go to Fay Da Bakery anymore. Not since she reported on how
New York’s largest Chinese bakery chain had allegedly stolen hundreds of
thousands of dollars in wages from its employees. </p>
<p>Many people feel connected to the famous bakery, Xu told VOA. “When
they saw the news, they were shocked,” she said. </p>
<p>In April, the bakery agreed to a $940,000 settlement to resolve
claims by former and current employees.</p>
<p>It was a big story — the kind that the nonprofit media outlet
Documented, where she works, likes to tell. Under-covered stories on
issues such as wage theft and housing are the focus of this
immigrant-focused news outlet.</p>
<p>With immigration a polarizing issue in the U.S. presidential
election, the news outlet finds itself balancing its typical coverage
with debunking false claims. As racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is
pushed by the far-right, Documented’s team sees their local coverage of
immigration as crucial.</p>
<p>The inspiration for Documented came from dissatisfaction with how
mainstream media often covered immigration, said co-founder Mazin
Sidahmed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Born in Sudan, Sidahmed worked for The Guardian in New York and other
media before helping set up his own outlet in 2018.</p>
<p>“No one was really covering how those big federal policy shifts were
playing out at the local level in big cities like New York, where most
immigrants actually live,” Sidahmed told VOA at the outlet’s office in
the Financial District. </p>
<p>“There was a real hole and a need for a site that was covering how
federal immigration policy was playing out locally,” he said.</p>
<p>A commitment to meeting the audience’s needs has been central to
Documented’s success, Sidahmed said. </p>
<p>Early on, the outlet launched a needs assessment focused on
Spanish-speaking audiences. It was hugely successful in figuring out how
to best serve that community, according to Sidahmed.</p>
<p>They found that respondents felt that they were typically portrayed
in the media as either criminals or victims, and they wanted news that
would help them navigate government resources. </p>
<p>When Documented learned that the community got most of its news from
WhatsApp groups, it started a Spanish-language news service on the
app.</p>
<p>“Over the past five years, it has really grown into an engine that’s
driving a lot of our most powerful journalism,” Sidahmed said. “But
getting it to that point was incredibly hard and challenging, and it
involved building a lot of trust.” </p>
<p>In addition to English and Spanish, Documented publishes in Mandarin
and Haitian Creole. To better serve the Chinese community, Documented
operates a news account on WeChat. For the Caribbean community, it uses
the platform NextDoor. </p>
<p>“We feel that we can’t ask people to go to our website to consume
news every day. We should deliver the news to them,” Xu said.</p>
<p>Platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat are two-way streets. Documented
delivers news, and audiences can directly contact reporters with story
tips or questions. </p>
<p>That way, said Sidahmed, Documented can produce content that is in
service of their needs.</p>
<p>It also publishes content that helps audiences navigate government
bureaucracy or access resources. </p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any mainstream news outlet that is really
working with immigrants directly in that way, to serve them, as opposed
to just covering them,” said Fisayo Okare. Originally from Nigeria, she
writes the outlet’s newsletter.</p>
<p>In 2022, New York City was home to about 3.1 million immigrants —
accounting for 38% of the city’s total population — according to a
report from the mayor’s office. </p>
<p>Many of Documented’s staffers count themselves among that population.
Okare thinks their work is enhanced by the team’s background.</p>
<p>“As an immigrant myself, I tend to understand what other immigrants
are going through,” she said. “We pride ourselves on not just writing
about immigrants but writing for them.” </p>
<p>More recently, that has included correcting baseless claims about
illegal immigration, including conspiracy theories that candidate Donald
Trump repeated about Haitians in Ohio.</p>
<p>“Our role during this time has been to put out the right information
whenever just completely wrong or inaccurate information is shared,”
Okare said. </p>
<p>Documented has also bucked trends in the U.S., where the local news
industry has been struggling for years.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, the U.S. has lost more than one-third of
its newspapers, according to a 2024 report by Northwestern University’s
Local News Initiative. Almost 55 million people across the country have
limited to no access to local news, the report found. </p>
<p>“When a city loses a local news institution, it has all of these
other catastrophic effects on the city. People start to see their local
issues in this nationalized lens and don’t feel as tethered and
connected to their communities,” Sidahmed said.</p>
<p>The journalist is optimistic about the future. Documented is aiming
to become the leading news source for the communities it is covering in
New York, he said. </p>
<p>“We see an opportunity to rebuild local news and rewrite that
contract between local news outlets and the communities that have
typically had bad relationships with local news,” he said.</p>

yet another problem in the carbon market. Twenty years ago, Nike created
millions of carbon credits tied to the sneaker brand’s efforts to stop
using sulfur hexafluoride, a powerful greenhouse gas that was previously
pumped into its soles. Now, ACR, formerly known as the American Carbon
Registry, has disclosed that more than a million of those credits are in
its “buffer pool,” which is supposed to provide insurance for buyers. If
a forestry project in the registry burns, for example, credits set aside
in the buffer pool can be cancelled to make up for the loss.<br/> <br/>
But Nike’s credits were basically meaningless to begin with — the
decision to change the shoes had nothing to do with the carbon market,
Nike confirmed to <em>Bloomberg</em> — and they’re even more meaningless
20 years later. “It was a somewhat notorious project for those of us in
the North American carbon market 15 years ago,” Derik Broekhoff, a

Raises $40.7 Million for ‘Thermochemical’ Energy Storage</h2>

Decarbonizing industrial processes such as paper and pulp production,
chemical manufacturing, or food processing is a tough sell. As it so
often goes, that’s largely due to the efficacy and low cost of natural
gas, which can cheaply and efficiently provide the high heat required
for these industries. But a number of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/antora-rondo-energy-thermal-batteries" target="_self">innovative
battery companies</a> are looking to shake up that dynamic, and the
latest, Redoxblox, just gained a big vote of confidence.
</p>
<p>
Today, the San Diego-based startup announced the close of its $40.7

<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111260321/en/RedoxBlox-Receives-25M-to-Demonstrate-Its-Pioneering-Long-Duration-Thermochemical-Energy-Storage-Technology#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20Khosla%20Ventures%2C%20RedoxBlox%20is%20backed%20by%20top%20climate%20technology%20firms%2C%20including%20Breakthrough%20Energy%20Ventures%20(BEV).%20BEV%20led%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20Seed%20round%20and%20participated%20in%20its%20Series%20A%20fundraise." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>led
by Khosla Ventures,</u></a> with participation from Breakthrough Energy
Ventures. The latest $31.3 million raise, announced today, was led by
the climate tech investor Prelude Ventures, with participation from
Imperative Ventures and New System Ventures, alongside BEV and Khosla.
While Redoxblox didn’t respond to an inquiry about why it raised these
two tranches so far apart, an SEC filing reveals that the company
initially aimed to raise $22.4 million in 2022, indicating that it fell
far short of its original goal.
</p>
<p>
Now though, the company looks poised for growth, and has announced the
appointment of a new CEO, Pasquale Romano, formerly the CEO of
ChargePoint, which operates a network of EV charging stations.
</p>
<p>
Redoxblox’s technology is known as “thermochemical energy storage,” as
the system stores energy both chemically and as heat. “What the founders
have discovered is a real scientific breakthrough,” Scott McNally, the
company’s vice president of development, told me. He said that Redoxblox
is mistakenly lumped in with thermal storage startups such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/rondo-battery-deal" target="_self"><u>Rondo</u></a>
or Antora all the time. But the company’s thermochemical solution is a
new class of energy storage entirely. “Yes, we store energy as heat, but
we also store energy in chemical bonds. That’s why fossil fuels are so
widely adopted, is because the amount of energy contained in a chemical
bond is enormous,” McNally explained. This allows Redoxblox to achieve
both very high energy density and very high temperatures.
</p>
<p>
The system uses grid electricity to charge when prices are low or when
there’s excess renewable generation. As electricity passes through the
company’s proprietary metal oxide storage pellets, they’re resistively
heated (like a toaster!) up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. When they hit a
certain temperature, this drives a “redox reaction,” which is a kind of
reaction in which electrons are transferred between two substances. In
Redoxblox’s case, the pellets release pure oxygen gas and absorb heat,
which is stored as chemical energy. To discharge that heat, a pump blows
air across the hot pellets; as the air heats up and the pellets absorb
oxygen from it, that oxygen-depleted air can then be delivered as heat
to power various industrial processes or to gas turbines to generate
electricity.
</p>
<p>
The redox reaction the company relies upon has been understood since the
1800s — what’s exciting is the proprietary metal oxide the company’s
founders discovered, which can cycle through this reaction again and
again. “The problem with fossil fuels is you can’t take a lump of ash
from burning coal, run electricity through it, and make coal again. But
with this, you actually can,” McNally told me. “We’ve cycled our
material through that more than 1,000 times with no loss of energy
density, no degradation.”
</p>
<p>
Redoxblox’s Series A funding comes in addition to about $17 million in
non-dilutive capital that the company has already received from an
ARPA-E grant, as well as
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111260321/en/RedoxBlox-Receives-25M-to-Demonstrate-Its-Pioneering-Long-Duration-Thermochemical-Energy-Storage-Technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
recent grants</u></a> from the Department of Energy and the California
Energy Commission, which will go towards building the company’s first
industrial demonstration projects.
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/nepa/articles/cx-031193-decarbonization-steam-generation-chemical-process-heating-through" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
$6.7 million DOE grant</u></a> supports RedoxBlox’s partnership with Dow
Chemicals, in which the startup will retrofit a gas-fired steam boiler
with its thermochemical battery at Dow’s manufacturing plant in
Charleston, West Virginia. And the CEC grant will support the buildout
of a 3 megawatt-hour long-duration energy storage system for UC San
Diego’s medical campus, which will provide 24 hours of electricity in
the case of a power outage.
</p>
<p>
Romano told me that Redoxblox also has partnerships with a paper mill
and a dairy production operation in Europe, where natural gas is
magnitudes more expensive, and thus the startup’s technology is much
more economically competitive. Ultimately of course, Redoxblox wants to
be cheaper than natural gas in the U.S., which Romano said currently
sits at about 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour.
</p>
<p>
However, this technology is not yet likely to make much of a dent in the
highest temperature industrial heating applications, such as steel and
cement manufacturing or certain chemical production processes. While
Redoxblox’s tech would theoretically work for these industries, the
energy demands would be astronomical.
</p>
<p>
The company is targeting its first commercialized product in 2026, which
will fit inside a shipping container and store up to 20 megawatt-hours
of energy at 95% efficiency. Multiple units can be combined to meet the
needs of larger facilities, and McNally told me that they’re not
necessarily targeting any one specific industry at the moment. As he put
it, “We’re just targeting anybody that uses natural gas that wants to
decarbonize at, in many cases, a lower cost than fossil fuels.”

<p class="drop-caps">
It’s all happening. The presidential election is a week away, and our
cohost Jesse Jenkins is back from vacation. There is so much to talk
about in the world of decarbonization and energy. So we tried to catch
up on all of it. Are EV sales starting to rebound in the U.S.? What’s up
with the Cybertruck? And what about Senator Joe Manchin’s permitting
reform bill?
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob attempt to discuss
all those questions and more. Peak oil demand — the IRA’s focus on
manufacturing — the emerging political economy of decarbonization — we
hit it all. Or we try to, at least. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson
Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a
professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I want to do a branching pass here for
a second. If Trump wins and Republicans want to pass [the
Manchin-Barrasso permitting] bill, I think Democrats should take them up
on it. Because all the changes to the oil and gas regime — almost all
the changes to the oil and gas permitting regime that are contemplated
by the bill will be done by a Trump administration. They could be done
through executive action, or through a helpful Congress in a Trump
administration. But the transmission stuff can’t be. So you might as
well take the transmission tailwind and then just do the stuff that a
Trump administration can do anyway.<br/> <br/> To be clear here, when
you talk to the modelers — not Jesse, other modelers — they say that the
expansion oil and gas that happened during Trump would dwarf any sense
of the changes contemplated by the bill. If Harris wins, then I think we
have the real conversation about whether this bill makes sense for
Democrats. But if Trump wins, I think, number one, Republicans aren’t
going to be interested in passing the bill. But if they are interested,
Democrats should take them up on it. <br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:
</strong>Yeah, so you have kind of a narrow range of circumstances where
this bill might be considered seriously in a lame duck, right? I think
you’re right that if Trump wins somehow they’re going to offer it,
Republicans are going to offer it, that’s an interesting deal for
Democrats. I just don’t think that’s too likely.<br/> <br/> I think the
most likely scenario where this bill is taken seriously is if Harris
wins and if the House and Senate are split. Whether they flip sides or
whatever the control looks like, going forward, if the Democrats have
the House and the Republicans have the Senate, or vice versa, this could
be the type of bipartisan bill that is sort of the best deal on the
table that, that might be able to get through regular order — that’s,
this bill would require 60 votes to get past the filibuster in the
Senate. <br/> <br/> So you know, it by nature has to be bipartisan. And
by definition, at this stage, a bipartisan bill is going to have some
things that climate advocates really don’t like. And if it has enough
that outweighs that, that’ll be the serious question.

forest managers finalize land exchange with Native American tribe in
Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMP VERDE, Ariz. — U.S. forest managers have finalized a land
exchange with the Yavapai-Apache Nation that has been decades in the
making and will significantly expand the size of the tribe’s reservation
in Arizona’s Verde Valley, tribal leaders announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>As part of the arrangement, six parcels of private land acquired over
the years by the tribe will be traded to the U.S. Forest Service in
exchange for the tribe gaining ownership of 12.95 square kilometers of
national forest land that is part of the tribe’s ancestral homelands.
The tribe will host a signing ceremony next week to celebrate the
exchange, which was first proposed in 1996.</p>
<p>“This is a critical step in our history and vital to the nation’s
cultural and economic recovery and future prosperity,” Yavapai-Apache
Chairwoman Tanya Lewis said in a post on the tribe’s website.</p>
<p>Prescott National Forest Supervisor Sarah Clawson said in a statement
that there had been many delays and changes to the proposal over the
years, but the tribe and the Forest Service never lost sight of
developing an agreement that would benefit both public and tribal
lands.</p>
<p>The federal government has made strides over recent years to protect
more lands held sacred by Native American tribes, to develop more
arrangements for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into management of
public lands and to streamline regulations for putting land into trust
for tribes.</p>
<p>The Yavapai-Apache Nation is made up of two distinct groups of people
— the Wipuhk’a’bah and the Dil’zhe’e. Their homelands spanned more than
41,440 square kilometers of what is now central Arizona. After the
discovery of gold in the 1860s near Prescott, the federal government
carved out only a fraction to establish a reservation. The inhabitants
eventually were forced from the land, and it wasn’t until the early
1900s that they were able to resettle a tiny portion of the area.</p>
<p>In the Verde Valley, the Yavapai-Apache Nation’s reservation lands
are currently comprised of less than 7.77 square kilometers near Camp
Verde. The small land base hasn’t been enough to develop economic
opportunities or to meet housing needs, Lewis said, pointing to dozens
of families who are on a waiting list for new homes.</p>
<p>Lewis said that in acknowledgment of the past removal of the
Yavapai-Apache people from their homelands, the preamble to the tribal
constitution recognizes that land acquisition is among the
Yavapai-Apache Nation’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>Aside from growing the reservation, the exchange will bolster efforts
by federal land managers to protect the headwaters of the Verde River
and ensure the historic Yavapai Ranch is not sold for development. The
agreement also will improve recreational access to portions of four
national forests in Arizona.</p>

tells jury of 9/11-style plot thwarted in the Philippines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A Kenyan man who plotted a 9/11-style attack on a U.S.
building was training as a commercial pilot in the Philippines when his
plans were interrupted, a federal prosecutor told a New York jury
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Bodansky told a federal jury in Manhattan
that Cholo Abdi Abdullah plotted an attack for four years that he hoped
to carry out on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab.</p>
<p>He said Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training
when he was arrested in July 2019 in the Philippines on local charges.
He was transferred in December 2020 to U.S. law enforcement authorities,
who charged him with terrorism-related crimes.</p>
<p>Abdullah underwent training in explosives and how to operate in
secret and avoid detection before moving to the Philippines in 2017 to
begin intensive training for a commercial pilot’s license, the
prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Abdullah posed as an aspiring commercial pilot even though his true
intention was to locate a building in the United States where he could
carry out a suicide attack from the cockpit by slamming his plane into a
building, Bodansky told the jury.</p>
<p>He said Abdullah was “planning for four years a 9/11-style attack”
only to have it thwarted with his arrest.</p>
<p>The defendant, operating from a Nairobi hotel, used the internet to
research how to breach a cockpit door and looked up a 2019 terrorist
attack that killed some 21 people, Bodansky said. Among those killed in
that attack was an American businessman who survived the World Trade
Center on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said Abdullah also researched information “about the
tallest building in a major U.S. city” before he was caught.</p>
<p>Abdullah, who is representing himself and once pleaded not guilty,
declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate
in questioning witnesses Tuesday.</p>
<p>In court papers filed before the trial, prosecutors told the judge
that they understood “through standby counsel that the defendant
maintains his position that he ‘wants to merely sit passively during the
trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would
accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate
system.’”</p>
<p>The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means “the
youth” in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant
group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic
state in Somalia based on Shariah law.</p>
<p>If convicted, Abdullah faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in
prison. His trial is expected to last three weeks.</p>

id="in-a-first-since-1938-des-moines-iowa-kids-will-trick-or-treat-on-halloween">In
a first since 1938, Des Moines, Iowa, kids will trick-or-treat on
Halloween</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — For the first time since 1938, children in Des
Moines, Iowa, will go trick-or-treating on Halloween.</p>
<p>Going door-to-door for candy on All Hallows’ Eve has long been
commonplace throughout the country. But not in Des Moines, where Iowa’s
capital city took a different approach more than seven decades ago in
hopes of tamping down on hooliganism.</p>
<p>Instead, Des Moines children don their costumes on Beggars’ Night,
typically the day before Halloween. And besides screaming,
“Trick-or-Treat,” children are expected to tell a joke before receiving
a treat.</p>
<p>This year, Beggars’ Night was set for Wednesday, but because of
expected heavy rain and thunderstorms, officials delayed
trick-or-treating until Thursday, which to the rest of the country is
the normal Halloween.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, it has never been moved or canceled since it was
established after Halloween in 1938,” Assistant City Manager Jen Schulte
said. “However, the safety of our residents, families and children is
always our top priority and led to the change in this year’s scheduled
Beggars’ Night.”</p>
<p>The city began its unusual custom at the suggestion of a former city
parks director as a way to reduce vandalism and promote more wholesome
fun for kids. Initially, children were encouraged to sing a song, recite
poetry and offer some other kind of entertainment, but over time a joke
became the most common offering.</p>
<p>Beggar’s Night also has limited hours, typically running from 6 to 8
p.m.</p>
<p>Many of Des Moines’ suburbs also adopted the Beggars’ Night tradition
and chose to shift the celebration to Halloween this year.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize we were that much of an anomaly because for us,
this is normal,” said Debbie Westphal Swander, who owns a costume shop
in West Des Moines. “We’re going to be in sync at least for this year
with the way the event is celebrated everywhere else.</p>
<p>“The big picture for me is, it’s absolutely about the kids. That’s
the most important thing.”</p>

id="us-finalizes-rule-restricting-investment-in-chinese-tech-firms">US
finalizes rule restricting investment in Chinese tech firms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Treasury Department on Monday finalized a new rule meant to
prevent U.S.-based people and companies from investing in the
development of a range of advanced technologies in China, thereby
preventing Beijing from accessing cutting-edge expertise and
equipment.</p>
<p>The rule, which implements an executive order signed by President Joe
Biden in 2023, focuses particularly on advanced semiconductors and
microelectronics and the equipment used to make them, technology used in
quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>When it takes effect on January 2, the rule will prohibit certain
transactions in semiconductors, microelectronics and artificial
intelligence. It also establishes mandatory reporting requirements for
transactions that are not banned outright.</p>
<p>In the field of quantum computing, the rule is more far-reaching,
banning all transactions “related to the development of quantum
computers or production of any critical components required to produce a
quantum computer,” as well as the development of other quantum systems.
Unlike the fields of AI and semiconductors, the rule does not allow for
transactions that can be completed so long as they are reported to the
government.</p>
<p>The rule also announced the creation of the Office of Global
Transactions within Treasury’s Office of Investment Security, which will
administer the Outbound Investment Security Program.</p>
<p>Justification and opposition</p>
<p>“Artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum technologies
are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military,
surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications like
cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next generation fighter
jets,” Paul Rosen, assistant secretary for investment security, said in
a statement.</p>
<p>“This Final Rule takes targeted and concrete measures to ensure that
U.S. investment is not exploited to advance the development of key
technologies by those who may use them to threaten our national
security,” Rosen said.</p>
<p>Beijing has repeatedly complained about U.S. technology policy,
arguing that the U.S. is dedicated to preventing China’s rise as a
global power. In a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated China’s longstanding objections to U.S.
efforts to withhold advanced technology from Chinese companies.</p>
<p>“China deplores and rejects the U.S.’s Final Rule to curb investment
in China,” Lin said. “China has protested to the U.S. and will take all
measures necessary to firmly defend its lawful rights and
interests.”</p>
<p>Not just equipment</p>
<p>The language of the rule frequently notes that it applies to
transactions with “countries of concern,” but the specific language in
the text makes it plain that the targets of the rule are companies and
individuals doing business in mainland China as well as the “special
administrative districts” of Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>The Final Rule’s ban on transactions is not limited to the physical
transfer of finished goods and machinery in the specified fields.
Explanatory documents released on Monday make it clear that several
intangible benefits are also covered.</p>
<p>Countries of concern “are exploiting or have the ability to exploit
certain United States outbound investments, including certain intangible
benefits that often accompany United States investments and that help
companies succeed,” an informational statement accompanying the rule
said. “These intangible benefits include enhanced standing and
prominence, managerial assistance, investment and talent networks,
market access, and enhanced access to additional financing.”</p>
<p>Signaling to US companies</p>
<p>The onus will be on U.S. companies to comply with the new rule,
Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the
Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, told VOA.</p>
<p>“This is the U.S. government signaling to U.S. entities and investors
that they need to think twice about making investments on the prohibited
transaction side of the equation that would advance China’s capabilities
in these areas,” Ezell said.</p>
<p>He added that the impact of the rule on investment in Chinese
technology companies would have effects far beyond any reduction in
funding.</p>
<p>“It’s not just the dollars,” he said. “A key target here is getting
at the intangible benefits that come with those investments, such as
managerial capability, talent networks.” He described that loss as “very
significant.”</p>
<p>Closing loopholes</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, Daniel Gonzales, a senior scientist at
the RAND Corporation, explained that the purpose of the rule was, in
part, to prevent U.S. investment firms from supporting Chinese firms in
the development of certain kinds of technology.</p>
<p>“These rules were put in place after many episodes where U.S.
[venture capital] companies helped to transfer or nurture advanced
technologies that have relevant military capabilities,” Gonzales wrote.
“One particular case was that of TikTok and its AI algorithms, which
were developed with the help of Sequoia Capital of California.”</p>
<p>Sequoia did not break any laws in assisting TikTok, Gonzales said.
But “it has since become known to U.S. authorities that TikTok does
possess an AI algorithm that has a variety of applications, some of
which have military implications. This new rule is intended to close
this loophole.”</p>
<p>Gonzales said the U.S. government’s concern with quantum computing is
also born of worries about Chinese offensive capabilities.</p>
<p>“Chinese researchers are working on developing quantum computer
algorithms that can break encryption codes used by the U.S. government
and the U.S. financial sector to protect private and confidential
information,” he wrote. “China has several startup companies working to
develop more powerful quantum computers. This new rule is intended to
prevent the leakage of U.S. quantum technology to China through U.S.
VCs.”</p>

court declines RFK Jr’s request to order 2 states to drop him from
ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court denied a bid Tuesday by former independent
presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from the
ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan for the Nov. 5 election. Kennedy has
said he wants voters who would have backed him to cast ballots for the
Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The court declined Kennedy’s emergency requests to order the
Wisconsin Elections Commission and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn
Benson to take him off the ballot in those states. Michigan and
Wisconsin are among a handful of closely contested states expected to
decide the outcome of the race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.
 </p>
<p>Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision
concerning the Michigan ballot only. No other justice publicly
dissented. </p>
<p>Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist known by

id="judge-dismisses-republican-lawsuit-targeting-pennsylvania-overseas-ballots">Judge
dismisses Republican lawsuit targeting Pennsylvania overseas
ballots</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a Republican lawsuit seeking to
force election battleground state Pennsylvania to strengthen its
procedures for verifying ballots submitted by military and overseas
voters. </p>
<p>Six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking
reelection on November 5 had sued Pennsylvania’s top election officials
on September 30. The Republicans had argued that the state was
improperly exempting overseas voters from a requirement that their
identity documents be verified, creating a vulnerability for fraudulent
votes to be submitted. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of a handful of closely contested states that are
expected to decide the outcome of the U.S. presidential race pitting
Republican Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala
Harris. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner dismissed the case in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, deciding that the plaintiffs had waited too
long to file their complaint given that Pennsylvania’s procedures had
been in place for years.</p>
<p>The suit was one of dozens around the country in which Republicans
have challenged voting procedures or sought to purge voter rolls in what
they call a push to ensure that people do not vote illegally. That legal
blitz has been faltering. In the past three weeks, Trump allies have
been dealt at least 11 court losses. </p>
<p>Conner also said Erick Kaardal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, had not
provided evidence that there had been foreign influence over
Pennsylvania’s overseas ballots. The judge wrote that when he pressed
Kaardal for such evidence during an October 18 hearing, the lawyer
“effectively conceded that all he had was ‘concerns.’” </p>
<p>“Plaintiffs cannot rely on phantom fears of foreign malfeasance to
excuse their lack of diligence,” Conner wrote. </p>
<p>“We don’t want votes from Iran or Russia or invalid votes counting,”
Kaardal had told the hearing in Harrisburg federal court over a motion
to dismiss the case filed by the Democratic National Committee and
Pennsylvania’s top elections official. </p>
<p>The Election Research Institute, a conservative group whose lawyer
Karen DiSalvo brought the case alongside Kaardal, said the plaintiffs
were disappointed by the dismissal and were considering options for
appeal. </p>
<p>Judges in the election battleground states of Michigan and North
Carolina this month also rejected lawsuits filed by the Republican
National Committee seeking to block votes from some Americans living
overseas. </p>
<p>In those cases, the Republicans argued the states improperly allowed
U.S. citizens living abroad who had never lived in those states to vote
there.</p>

<h2 id="two-offshore-wind-developers-wade-into-the-gulf-of-maine">Two
Offshore Wind Developers Wade Into the Gulf of Maine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDAxNjg3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjA2NDk5OX0.EP572QLZcb9dedWYqLqszZJr0_-0d0cXGPKJ97dXjYM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Just days before what is sure to be a close presidential election in
which one of the candidates has promised to shut down the offshore wind
industry “on day one,” an auction for the rights to develop wind energy
projects in the Gulf of Maine on Tuesday was a surprise success.
</p>
<p>
Two developers, Avangrid and Invenergy, purchased four of the eight
leases that were up for sale. If turned into wind farms, they have the
potential to generate about 6.8 gigawatts, or enough electricity to
power about 2.3 million homes, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management.
</p>
<p>
Compared with the optimism on display just two years ago, when more than
a dozen companies competed in a
<a href="https://grist.org/energy/a-record-breaking-offshore-wind-lease-sale-signals-a-new-era-for-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three-day
bidding war</u></a> for the right to develop six areas off the coast of
New York and New Jersey, Tuesday’s sale was a flop. Just two companies
participated. The bidding closed after one round. The leases sold for a
flat $50 per acre, compared to an average of nearly $9,000 per acre in
the New York sale.
</p>
<p>
But put in context of how things are going in 2024, it’s a miracle
anyone showed up at all. The offshore wind industry has been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/offshore-wind-2024-outlook" target="_self"><u>struggling</u></a>
with supply chain issues and inflation, not to mention increasing
opposition from coastal communities. Just a month ago, an offshore wind
lease sale off the coast of Oregon was
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/27/oregon-offshore-wind-auction-cancellation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceled</u></a>
after the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management learned that there was only
one interested party. The agency also canceled an auction for the Gulf
of Mexico earlier this year citing a lack of interest.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll be a win if anything gets leased,” Francis Eanes, executive
director of the Maine Labor Climate Council, told me Tuesday morning
before the results came in. “And honestly, it won’t be surprising if it
doesn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Outside of the existential threat of a Trump presidency, developing wind
projects in the Gulf of Maine was already a challenging prospect. The
water is upwards of 200 meters deep — too deep to affix the foundation
of a wind turbine to the seafloor. Instead, developers will need to
build floating structures that are moored to the seabed with giant
cables. Floating offshore wind is a proven technology — there are a
handful of projects already operating around the world. But it is more
expensive to build, and there are none yet operating in the U.S. The
National Renewable Energy Laboratory
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88988.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimates</u></a>
that floating offshore wind farms will have a levelized cost of energy
that’s at least 40% higher than fixed-bottom projects.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, just days ago, the U.S. Department of Energy rejected
Maine’s application for a $456 million grant to build a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/maine-floating-wind-sears-island" target="_self"><u>floating
offshore wind assembly port on Sears Island</u></a>, a protected area in
Penobscot Bay about the size of New York City’s Central Park. A new port
is a necessary prerequisite for developing projects in the Gulf of
Maine, as floating offshore wind assembly requires different
infrastructure than fixed-bottom projects.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, Tyler Hansen, a research associate studying offshore wind
at Dartmouth College, told me he thought the results of the auction
“make sense” when weighing the prospects for the technology against the
political risks. He expects the cost of floating offshore wind to come
down as governments around the world invest in research and development.
The Department of Energy has a
“<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot-progress-and-priorities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Floating
Offshore Wind Shot</u></a>,” a program aimed at reducing the cost of
floating technology 70% by 2030.
</p>
<p>
The winds that blow over the Gulf of Maine are especially strong and
steady, making them one of the best potential renewable energy resources
in the United States. The northeast is also “particularly blessed” with
available substations where projects could connect to the grid, Eric
Hines, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Tufts
University told me. Several recent coal plant closures on the
Massachusetts coast have created “an enormous amount of coastal
transmission capacity that are prime locations for plugging in offshore
wind,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The area also boasts favorable policy paired with relatively strong
grassroots support. States in the Northeast are counting on floating
offshore wind to hit their climate goals. Maine has set a goal of
achieving 100% clean electricity by 2040, with at least 3 gigawatts of
power prescribed to come from the Gulf. Massachusetts, too, anticipates
needing some 23 gigawatts from offshore wind by 2050, with at least 10
coming from the Gulf of Maine.
</p>
<p>
Environmental groups in Maine have spent the past two years building
political coalitions with fishermen, tribes, and labor unions in support
of developing an offshore wind industry. Those efforts culminated in a
major victory last summer when the state passed a bill that set strong
labor standards for offshore wind development, created a requirement for
tribal engagement in project development, and enshrined a policy of
avoiding development in a key fishery known as Lobster Management Area
One. Later, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management amended its map of
lease areas in the Gulf of Maine to exclude that management area.
</p>
<p>
“That was a huge win,” Eanes said, and never would have happened without
the environmental and labor movement’s proactive efforts to build
consensus around where offshore wind <em><em>should</em></em> happen, if
it were going to happen. As a result, they’ve been able to cultivate a
different attitude toward offshore wind in Maine than you will find
right now in New Jersey, for example.
</p>
<p>
“To be clear, if you go to a coastal community in Maine, especially one
that lands a lot of lobsters, you’re not going to find support for
offshore wind,” he said. “But the level of organized opposition has not
been as pitched as it would have been had we seen lease areas in Lobster
Management Area One.”
</p>
<p>
In a press release, Avangrid touted the Gulf of Maine’s strong wind
speeds and access to interconnection, as well as the fact that it was
“largely deconflicted from other ocean users following a rigorous
federal public engagement process.” The company is already developing
more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind along the East Coast, including
Vineyard Wind, which is currently under construction. This will be its
first project to utilize floating technologies, however it is also owned
by Iberdrola, a Spanish company with a pipeline of floating offshore
wind projects in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Maine officials celebrated the results of the auction on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
“The federal lease sale represents a significant milestone for Maine and
the region as we advance offshore wind in a responsible manner to help
us reduce our reliance on expensive, harmful fossil fuels, diversify our
sources of energy, grow our economy, and fight climate change,”<strong>
</strong>said Dan Burgess, Director of the Maine Governor’s Energy
Office, in an emailed statement.
</p>
<p>
The Maine Department of Transportation, the agency leading the
development of the would-be port, emphasized that it’s undeterred
despite losing out on the federal grant. “Maine has a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to develop a port facility to create good-paying jobs while
serving the entire region as we harness abundant clean wind energy in
the Gulf of Maine,” Bruce Van Note, the transportation commissioner,
said in a statement last week. “Our work will continue as we examine
other opportunities to secure funding to advance this critical port
infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
The agency
<a href="https://www.maine.gov/mdot/projects/searsport/windport/docs/Maine%20OSWP_Pre-Application%20Alternative%20Analysis_Draft-October%202024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>anticipates</u></a>
filing federal permit applications for the project in the next few
months, kicking off a process anticipated to take two years, and
securing additional funding for it by the end of 2025. But that timeline
may depend on the results of the presidential election next week.
</p>
<p>
While it’s not always the best advice to take Donald Trump at his word,
the former president promised supporters at a rally in New Jersey in May
that he would “end” offshore wind development. “You won’t have to worry
about Governor Murphy’s 157 windmills,” he said. “I’m going to write it
out in an executive order. It’s going to end on day one.”
</p>
<p>
In its most recent
<a href="https://oceantic.org/2024-q3-u-s-offshore-wind-quarterly-market-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quarterly
market report</u></a>, the industry association Oceantic Network noted
that private investment and activity in the offshore wind sector “are
decelerating … due largely to the uncertainty around the presidential
election.”
</p>
<p>
At the same time, developers are used to long time horizons. Offshore
wind projects can take a decade to permit and build, and as long as
state support doesn’t slide, a slowdown of four years isn’t
make-or-break. Even with a supportive administration, it will likely be
impossible for Avangrid or Invenergy to begin construction in the Gulf
of Maine before 2030, as that’s the absolute soonest Maine expects to
get its port built.
</p>
<p>
The fact that two developers took the leap now rather than waiting for
2028 — which is when the next lease sale in the Gulf of Maine is
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-new-five-year-offshore-wind-leasing-schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scheduled</u></a>
— shows some level of confidence in the long-term prospects for the
industry.
</p>
<p>
“These leases don’t come up for auction very often,” Hines told me. “And
if you don’t have a lease, you can’t build a project.”

id="teri-garr-comic-actor-of-young-frankenstein-and-tootsie-has-died">Teri
Garr, comic actor of ‘Young Frankenstein’ and ‘Tootsie,’ has died</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Teri Garr, the quirky comedy actor who rose from
background dancer in Elvis Presley movies to co-star of such favorites
as Young Frankenstein and Tootsie, has died. She was 79. </p>
<p>Garr died Tuesday of multiple sclerosis “surrounded by family and
friends,” publicist Heidi Schaeffer said. Garr battled other health
problems in recent years and underwent an operation in January 2007 to
repair an aneurysm. </p>
<p>Admirers took to social media in her honor, with writer-director Paul
Feig calling her “truly one of my comedy heroes. I couldn’t have loved
her more” and screenwriter Cinco Paul saying: “Never the star, but
always shining. She made everything she was in better.” </p>
<p>The actor, who was sometimes credited as Terri, Terry or Terry Ann
during her long career, seemed destined for show business from her
childhood. </p>
<p>Her father was Eddie Garr, a well-known vaudeville comedian; her
mother was Phyllis Lind, one of the original high-kicking Rockettes at
New York’s Radio City Music Hall. Their daughter began dance lessons at
6 and by 14 was dancing with the San Francisco and Los Angeles ballet
companies. </p>
<p>She was 16 when she joined the road company of West Side Story in Los
Angeles, and as early as 1963 she began appearing in bit parts in
films. </p>
<p>She recalled in a 1988 interview how she won the West Side Story
role. After being dropped from her first audition, she returned a day
later in different clothes and was accepted. </p>
<p>From there, the blonde, statuesque Garr found steady work dancing in
movies, and she appeared in the chorus of nine Presley films, including
Viva Las Vegas, Roustabout and Clambake. </p>
<p>She also appeared on numerous television shows, including Star Trek,
Dr. Kildare and Batman, and was a featured dancer on the rock ‘n’ roll
music show Shindig, the rock concert performance T.A.M.I. and a cast
member of The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. </p>
<p>Her big film break came as Gene Hackman’s girlfriend in 1974’s
Francis Ford Coppola thriller The Conversation. That led to an interview
with Mel Brooks, who said he would hire her for the role of Gene
Wilder’s German lab assistant in 1974’s Young Frankenstein — if she
could speak with a German accent. </p>
<p>“Cher had this German woman, Renata, making wigs, so I got the accent
from her,” Garr once recalled. </p>
<p>The film established her as a talented comedy performer, with New
Yorker film critic Pauline Kael proclaiming her “the funniest neurotic
dizzy dame on the screen.” </p>
<p>Her big smile and off-center appeal helped land her roles in Oh God!
opposite George Burns and John Denver, Mr. Mom (as Michael Keaton’s
wife) and Tootsie in which she played the girlfriend who loses Dustin
Hoffman to Jessica Lange. </p>
<p>Although best known for comedy, Garr showed in such films as Close
Encounters of the Third Kind, The Black Stallion and The Escape Artist
that she could handle drama equally well. </p>
<p>She had a flair for spontaneous humor, often playing David
Letterman’s foil during guest appearances on NBC’s Late Night With David
Letterman early in its run. </p>
<p>Her appearances became so frequent, and the pair’s good-natured
bickering so convincing, that for a time rumors cropped up that they
were romantically involved. Years later, Letterman credited those early
appearances with helping make the show a hit. </p>
<p>It was also during those years that Garr began to feel something in
her right leg. It began in 1983 and eventually spread to her right arm.
By 1999 the symptoms had become so severe that she consulted a doctor.
The diagnosis: multiple sclerosis. </p>
<p>For three years Garr didn’t reveal her illness. </p>
<p>“I was afraid that I wouldn’t get work,” she explained in a 2003
interview. “People hear MS and think, ‘Oh, my God, the person has two
days to live.’” </p>
<p>After going public, she became a spokeswoman for the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, making humorous speeches to gatherings in
the U.S. and Canada. </p>
<p>“You have to find your center and roll with the punches because
that’s a hard thing to do: to have people pity you,” she said in 2005.
“Just trying to explain to people that I’m OK is tiresome.” </p>
<p>She also continued to act, appearing on Law &amp; Order: Special
Victims Unit, Greetings From Tucson, Life With Bonnie and other TV
shows. She also had a brief recurring role on Friends in the 1990s as
Lisa Kudrow’s mother. After several failed romances, Garr married
contractor John O’Neill in 1993. They adopted a daughter, Molly, before
divorcing in 1996.</p>

id="us-reiterates-one-china-policy-amid-reports-of-xis-request-on-taiwan">US
reiterates ‘one China’ policy amid reports of Xi’s request on
Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject
independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is
no change in its “one China” policy which takes no stand on the
issue.</p>
<p>“We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait
differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,” a
senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring
long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. “We oppose unilateral
changes to the status quo by either side.”</p>
<p>The confirmation followed reports that during their last in-person
meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to
change the language the administration uses when discussing its position
on Taiwan independence.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last
November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language
stating it “opposes” instead of “does not support” independence for
Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements.</p>
<p>The administration has been “consistent on our long-standing one
China policy,” the official said. Under the policy, the U.S.
acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty
over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan’s status as unsettled.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request
for comment.</p>
<p>Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the
Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi
also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts.</p>
<p>The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances
falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese
independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute.</p>
<p>“I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice
without some substantial concession from China on its own position about
Taiwan,” Cooper told VOA. “I doubt this will get any traction in
Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about
de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South
America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima,
Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be
Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in
January.</p>
<p>“It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say
goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps
including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,” said
Cooper.</p>
<p>Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration
ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice
President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with
Trump saying he would impose “150% to 200%” tariffs on China if it
sought to blockade Taiwan.</p>
<p>Flared tensions</p>
<p>Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On
Sunday, Taiwan’s defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships
carried out another “combat patrol” near the island, following Beijing’s
threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the
United States.</p>
<p>The administration announced it approved the package last week, which
includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air
Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s
strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan
Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself.</p>
<p>China “strongly condemns” the sale. “We will take resolute
countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend
national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” said a
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. </p>

id="trump-ally-steve-bannon-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress">Trump
ally Steve Bannon released after serving 4 months in prison for contempt
of Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DANBURY, Conn. — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released
from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for
defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S.
Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury,
Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the
federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in
the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He’s also expected to
resume his podcast Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court
rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his
conviction.</p>
<p>A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of
Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House
Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his
involvement Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the
2020 presidential race.</p>
<p>When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a
“political prisoner.”</p>
<p>“I am proud of going to prison,” he said at the time, adding that he
was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a “corrupt” Justice
Department.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next
week’s election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon’s convictions in May.
Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal
team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because
Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon
had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked
executive privilege in front of the committee.</p>
<p>Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court,
alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering,
conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled
to begin in December.</p>

reaches out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — Adidas has reached an out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye
to end all legal proceedings between them, the sportswear brand said on
Tuesday, adding that no money changed hands in the agreement.</p>
<p>Adidas and Ye had been embroiled in multiple lawsuits for the past
two years, since the German company ended a partnership with the rapper
previously known as Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any more open issues, and there is no… money going
either way, and we both move on,” CEO Bjorn Gulden told reporters on a
conference call, declining to give further details of the deal.</p>
<p>“There were tensions on many issues, and… when you put the claims on
the right side and you put the claims on the left side, both parties
said we don’t need to fight anymore and withdrew all the claims,” Gulden
added.</p>

<h2 id="the-energy-transition-is-slowing-down">The Energy Transition Is
Slowing Down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The Paris Agreement goal of holding warming to well less than 2 degrees
Celsius over pre-industrial levels is not just increasingly appearing to
be out of reach. The energy transition as a whole is slowing down.
</p>
<p>
This was the stark warning from Wood Mackenzie’s
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/market-insights/topics/energy-transition-outlook/" target="_blank">Energy
Transition Outlook</a>, the energy consultancy’s annual assessment of
global progress toward decarbonizing the economy. “Progress toward a
low-carbon energy system is stumbling on multiple fronts, leaving the
world dependent on fossil fuels for longer,” the outlook’s authors
write.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the International Energy Agency’s Global Energy Outlook, which
found
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/climate/global-demand-electricity-rising.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>faster
than expected global electricity demand imperiling Paris goals</u></a>,
and the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report,
which warned that unless emissions were soon wrenched down “it will
become impossible” to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report
completes a grim picture. The question now is less “Can the world meet
the Paris Agreement goals?” and more “How will we manage once we’ve
missed them?”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Wood Mackenzie takes 2.5 degrees of warming as its “base
case,” consistent with other estimates,
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024/executive-summary" target="_blank"><u>including
the IEA’s</u></a>. The report’s authors have little optimism left about
the prospect of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and limiting warming
to 1.5 degrees. Instead, they used to the report to “highlight the
potential of a delayed transition,” in which warming rises to 3 degrees,
said Jonathan Sultoon, Wood Mackenzie’s head of markets and transitions,
on a call with reporters Monday.
</p>
<p>
“We’re in the middle of the 2020s, the decade that’s pivotal to
accelerate the energy transition” Sultoon said, “and no major countries
— and very few companies — are on track to meet their 2030 climate
goals.”
</p>
<p>
To meet even the 2.5 degree warming scenario — one that many scientists
warn could result in difficult to predict and possibly irreversible
climate impacts — would still require that global emissions peak by
2027. Emissions, instead, are rising — by some 1.3% in 2023, according
to the United Nations.
</p>
<p>
The likelihood of slipping from 2.5 degrees to 3 will be determined by
politics, Wood Mackenzie’s analysts argue, whether it’s the war in
Ukraine and unstable Middle East leading countries to reinvest in fossil
fuels for energy security or protectionist policies that block imports
of world-leading low-priced Chinese renewable technology.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“China’s the lower-cost producer in clean tech,” Sultoon said. “Either
the rest of the world needs to rely on Chinese manufacturing to speed
the transition,” or “the West will pay a higher cost — or, in fact,
delay the transition. And it looks far more likely to be that latter
situation than the former.”
</p>
<p>
Policymakers in the rest of the high-emitting world, especially the
United States, are perfectly aware of China’s dominance of much of the
low-carbon technology stack, ranging from solar panels to lithium
refining. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_blank">they’re
seeking to nurture their own industries</a>, seeking both to secure
energy supplies in case of global conflict and to protect native workers
and industries. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em></em></strong>The political or security logic of these
movies might be clear enough, but the Wood Mackenzie analysts are
skeptical of this approach, at least when it comes to advancing
decarbonization. “These dual goals — of decarbonisation and reducing
dependence on metals supply from China — are at odds,” they write. “It
will take years, if not decades, to shift away from China because it
controls up to 70% of global supply chains across several commodities.
It is also the lowest-cost producer. The rest of the world may need to
rely on Chinese manufacturing or be prepared to either pay a higher cost
or delay the transition.”
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the growth in electricity demand, which the IEA
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_blank">also
highlighted</a>. While any scenario that brings down emissions globally
to levels consistent with even 2.5 degrees of warming, let alone 1.5,
will involve a high degree of electrification of processes currently
reliant on the combustion of fossil fuels, new demand for electricity
can have ambiguous effects on overall emissions depending on the ability
of non-carbon-emitting generation to meet that demand.
</p>
<p>
“The quick expansion of electricity supply is often constrained by
transmission infrastructure which takes time to develop,” the report
says. This means new demand could be met by fossil fuels, that the
energy transition could become more expensive than it would be under a
lower demand scenario, or that some crucial amount of electrification
just simply does not happen.
</p>
<p>
“What happens if geopolitical crises, expanded trade restrictions, or
protectionist policies becomes the norm, rather than the exception on a
long-term basis? And where you see slower cost declines for alternative
energy?” asked David Brown, director of Wood Mackenzie’s energy
transition practice. If things continue as they are, that’s a question
we’ll all have to answer. <strong></strong>

id="chinas-xi-pressed-biden-to-alter-language-on-taiwan-sources-say">China’s
Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI — Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S.
President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States
uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according
to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation.</p>
<p>During last November’s Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and
his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S.
official statements.</p>
<p>China wanted the U.S. to say “we oppose Taiwan independence,” rather
than the current version, which is that the United States “does not
support” independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested
anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated
in or were briefed on.</p>
<p>Xi’s aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the
months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person
familiar with the exchanges.</p>
<p>The U.S. has declined to make the change.</p>
<p>The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement
that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan
independence. “The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on
our long-standing One China policy,” the statement read.</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said: “You should ask this question to the
U.S. government. China’s position on the Taiwan issue is clear and
consistent.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s foreign ministry declined comment.</p>
<p>The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists.</p>
<p>The Republic of China remains Taiwan’s formal name and the government
says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign,
independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its
own.</p>
<p>Sensitive issue</p>
<p>For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to
make changes to how it refers to Taiwan’s status, which remains the most
sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed
push at the leader level has not been reported previously.</p>
<p>The United States severed official relations with the government in
Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed
Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own
territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island
under its control.</p>
<p>It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he
has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office
and China’s military has significantly ramped up its activities around
the island in recent years.</p>
<p>The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a
non-starter.</p>
<p>Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by
Washington, said one of the sources.</p>
<p>Leaders in Beijing “would love it if Joe Biden said very different
things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt,” said one senior Biden
administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard
U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence.</p>
<p>During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government
with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend
the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S.
position of “strategic ambiguity.”</p>
<p>Change would reverberate</p>
<p>A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence
would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S.
partners, competitors and adversaries alike.</p>
<p>Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would
interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward
less support for Taipei’s defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time
when Beijing has ramped up military pressure.</p>
<p>China has over the past five years staged almost daily military
activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war
games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part
of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground
targets.</p>
<p>Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S.
policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan’s future through
peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against
Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play.</p>
<p>Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the
status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new
state.</p>
<p>In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing
wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging
Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the
Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence
for the island.</p>
<p>The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden’s term in
office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines
of next month’s G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one
of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part.</p>
<p>The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his
successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former
President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.</p>

Post’s Bezos defends decision to end presidential endorsements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended the newspaper’s
decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate after a report
that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions
following the move.</p>
<p>The decision blocked an endorsement of Democrat Vice President Kamala
Harris, the National Public Radio report said, and many people in
messages on the newspaper’s website criticized Bezos, the billionaire
founder of Amazon.com and rocket company Blue Origin.</p>
<p>Bezos, in an opinion piece late on Monday, said “most people believe
the media is biased” and the Washington Post and other newspapers needed
to boost their credibility.</p>
<p>No candidate was informed or consulted about the decision and that
there was “no quid pro quo,” Bezos said, adding that there was no
connection between the decision and a meeting between Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump and Blue Origin’s CEO on the same
day.</p>
<p>“Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an
election,” Bezos wrote. “What presidential endorsements actually do is
create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending
them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”</p>
<p>The subscription cancellations as of midday represented about 8% of
the paper’s paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes
print as well, reported NPR, which said a series of columnists had
resigned their positions in protest.</p>
<p>The Washington Post declined to comment on the report when contacted
by Reuters.</p>
<p>In a post on Friday, William Lewis, The Washington Post’s publisher
and CEO, said the newspaper would not be making an endorsement of a
presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election, nor in any future
presidential election.</p>
<p>“We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential
candidates,” Lewis wrote.</p>
<p>“The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the
presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,” wrote 20 columnists in an
opinion piece on the Post’s website, adding that it “represents an
abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper
that we love.”</p>

South Korea to confer on North Korean troop deployment to Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — Top diplomatic and military officials from the
United States and South Korea are set to convene in Washington this
Thursday as the two allies closely monitor and express concerns about
North Korea’s deployment of about 10,000 troops to Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. officials and analysts say that China could be
displeased by Russia’s growing influence over North Korea, and that if
Beijing chose, it could restrict exports of materials that Pyongyang
might use for munitions production.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin will co-host South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul
and Minister of Defense Kim Yong-hyun to coordinate on pressing security
threats facing the alliance.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during Monday’s
briefing that high on the agenda would be discussion of “North Korea’s
expanding relationship with Russia,” which includes the deployment of
North Korean troops to Russia;  various other provocative actions by
North Korea in recent months; and the U.S. commitment to security in the
Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The consultation between Washington and Seoul will come two weeks
after establishment of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, a
group formed by the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies
to better coordinate enforcement of sanctions against North Korea.</p>
<p>The group said that while “the path to dialogue” with North Korea
remained open, it was committed to “safeguard the global
nonproliferation regime and address the threat arising from the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s [DPRK, North Korea’s official
name] weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which
are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.”</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest that by sending troops to support Russia’s war
on Ukraine, North Korea may gain an opportunity to test the
effectiveness of its ballistic missiles and munitions.</p>
<p>“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear
that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned
about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and
North Korea,” Miller added. He was referring to People’s Republic of
China.</p>
<p>Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies, noted that while China has been supportive of
Russia’s war in Ukraine, North Korea’s involvement introduces an
unsettling dynamic.</p>
<p>“For one,” Cha said, “China does not like Russia to have so much
influence over North Korea.”</p>
<p>Cha added that Beijing could take specific actions, such as curbing
exports of petroleum coke to North Korea, which can be used in munitions
production.</p>
<p>“According to recent public reports, imports of this good [used for
steel production] have dramatically increased while overall trade has
only slowly started to return to normal,” he said.</p>
<p>Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Austin would also
meet with his South Korean counterpart Wednesday, when he will host Kim
at the Pentagon for the 56th U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting. ROK
refers to South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<h2 id="biden-hosts-white-house-diwali-reception">Biden hosts White
House Diwali reception</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the start of the five-day
festival of Diwali — the celebration that symbolizes the victory of
light over darkness and is marked by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the
world, especially in India. </p>
<p>Biden began the White House festivities by lighting a small prayer
lamp known as a diya. Several hundred guests — including South Asian
administration officials, elected officials, prominent community members
and others — wore silks and embroidered finery and thronged the White
House’s massive and heavily chandeliered East Room for the
occasion. </p>
<p>But Biden used the occasion to shine a light on someone who was not
in the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris, the most prominent South
Asian American, who was busy on the campaign trail as the election
swiftly approaches. Her late mother immigrated to the United States from
what was then the Indian city of Madras, now called Chennai. </p>
<p>“One of the things we bonded over was the role each of our mothers
played in our lives,” Biden said. “They come from different places,
different generations, different lives, but they shared a basic belief
about America: Only in America is anything possible. Only in
America.”</p>
<p>And, he said, after hundreds of years of struggle, South Asian
Americans have made the U.S. their home. </p>
<p>“Diwali is celebrated openly and proudly here in the White House,” he
said. “And by the way, this is not my house. This is your house.”</p>
<p>The festival starts on the darkest night of the year, per the Hindu
lunar calendar — October 31, according to the Indian government. The day
is a national holiday.</p>
<p>Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was visibly moved by the occasion,
spoke of how his parents’ faith illuminated their path after they
immigrated to the U.S. from India. </p>
<p>“That is the message of Diwali,” he said. ”Choose light always,
whatever the future may bring. Whatever the future may bring, it is our
light and our fierce commitment to one another that will see us through
to a better day.”</p>
<p>And joining the festivities from afar was International Space Station
commander Sunita Williams. Her father immigrated to the U.S. from India;
her mother, from Slovenia. She spoke to the White House crowd via a
recorded message from 420 kilometers (260 miles) above the Earth. </p>
<p>“On this day, I specifically think about my father, who immigrated to
the U.S. from India,” she said. “He kept and shared his cultural roots
by teaching us about Diwali and other Indian festivals. Diwali is a time
of joy, as goodness in the world prevails. I am so thankful to have
grown up in a multicultural household where our parents encouraged us to
seek opportunities and reach for the stars.”</p>
<p>Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential
celebrations of Diwali that date to President George W. Bush’s time in
office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali
celebrations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The festival marks the return of the mythical Lord Ram, named in
Sanskrit scripture as a reincarnation of the god Vishnu, from exile
after 14 years. The people of his kingdom, Ayodhya, lit lamps to
illuminate his path home — a tradition that merrymakers continue today
with lamps and pyrotechnics. Indian Americans are the largest non-mixed
Asian group in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
with nearly 4.4 million people identifying as 100% Indian in
origin. </p>
<p>Today, celebrants around the world honor the occasion with new
clothes, extravagant decorations and massive quantities of sugar-laden
confections.</p>
<p>This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the top
proponent of a Hindu-nationalist movement known as Hindutva, saw a sweet
named in his honor. The so-called “Modi Laddu” — the Modi Ball — is made
of saffron, clarified butter, pistachios, almonds and rose water.</p>
<p>But there is also a vein of bitterness in India’s observance of this
holiday.</p>
<p>Modi was the driving force behind the rebuilding of a Hindu temple in
Ayodhya, on what was thought to be Ram’s birthplace. In 1992, a Hindu
mob demolished a mosque on that site, prompting deadly religious riots
that were the worst since India’s independence, leaving more than 2,000
people dead. Modi spent years raising funds to erect a massive Hindu
temple on the ruins. He opened it earlier this year, saying, “Today, our
Ram has come.”</p>

If Donald Trump is reelected president, the Federal Reserve’s political

Marine sentenced to 7 years for white supremacist plot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A former U.S. Marine was sentenced to seven years in
prison Monday for his role in a white supremacist plot to destroy power
facilities. </p>
<p>Jordan Duncan, 29, pleaded guilty in North Carolina in June to aiding
in the manufacture of a firearm. </p>
<p>Duncan and four other men, including two other ex-Marines, were
arrested in 2020 in connection with what authorities described as a
neo-Nazi plot to sow chaos by targeting the power grid. </p>
<p>“We have now brought to justice all five of the defendants involved
in a self-described ‘modern day SS,’ who conspired, prepared, and
trained to attack America’s power grid in the name of violent white
supremacist ideology,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a
statement. </p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray said the group was “inspired by
racially motivated violent extremism.” </p>
<p>“If the defendants had been able to carry out an attack it could have
caused suffering to thousands of American citizens,” Wray said. </p>
<p>The other four defendants were previously sentenced to prison terms
between 21 months and 10 years. </p>
<p>According to court documents, two members of the group were active on
“Iron March,” a neo-Nazi online forum, until it was closed in 2017. They
also recruited the other three people involved. </p>
<p>The group accumulated firearms and produced a video of live-fire
training in the desert near Boise, Idaho, that ended with the phrase
“Come home white man” as the final frame. </p>
<p>Components of the power grid in the northwestern United States were
listed as potential targets in handwritten notes found in the possession
of one of the conspirators.</p>

person dead in Iowa from Lassa fever, state health department says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed
the death of a middle-aged eastern Iowa resident from Lassa fever.</p>
<p>The individual had recently returned from travel to West Africa,
where it is believed the person contracted the virus, the state health
department said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to
confirm the diagnosis of Lassa fever, the state health department said.
The CDC said it assesses the risk to the general public to be extremely
low.</p>
<p>Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen
in the United States.</p>
<p>There have been eight travel-associated cases of Lassa fever in the
United States in the past 55 years, according to the Iowa health
department.</p>
<p>In West Africa, the Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to
humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents.</p>
<p>About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5,000 related
deaths occur in West Africa each year, according to the CDC.</p>

No Easy Way to Fill Climate Tech’s ‘Missing Middle’</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Sometimes it’s called the “missing middle,” sometimes, more ominously,
the “valley of death.” Whatever the terminology, it’s undeniable that a
chasm lies between a climate company’s early funding rounds and its
eventual commercial scale-up, one that’s getting harder and harder to
bridge. From the first half of last year to the first half of this one,
total Series B funding declined by nearly a quarter; beyond Series C
rounds — what the market intelligence platform
<a href="https://www.ctvc.co/a-weak-11-3bn-start-to-2024-climate-tech/?ref=ctvc-by-sightline-climate-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CTVC</u></a>
calls “growth funding” — it declined by a third.
</p>
<p>
“The capital needs of these businesses have just outgrown their early
stage backers,” Frank O’Sullivan, a managing director for S2G Ventures’
energy investments, told me. “But the infrastructure investors have
absolutely no appetite whatsoever for taking on an unproven technology
and scaling.” S2G makes both early stage and growth stage investments,
and O’Sullivan co-authored a
<a href="https://www.s2gventures.com/2023-capital-imbalances-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white
paper</u></a> last year on the problem of the “missing middle.” The
paper found that of the $270 billion in private capital for clean energy
raised between 2017 and 2022, just 20% was allocated to late-stage and
growth-focused investments, while 43% went to earlier rounds and 37%
toward deploying established tech.
</p>
<p>
Of course, some of climate tech’s funding gap can be attributed to
broader trends in the venture market and economic landscape.
Covid-related disruptions and low interest rates led investors to throw
money at promising startups, only to see their valuations drop as
inflation (with rising interest rates to match) and geopolitical
uncertainty cooled down the overheated market. Other companies went
directly onto the public market via special purpose acquisition
companies, only to underperform expectations. “There is capital to be
deployed,” O’Sullivan told me. “But a lot of the companies that need
that capital are struggling, really, to swallow hard and take
significant restructuring of their previous valuations.”
</p>
<p>
With clean tech in particular, there’s also frequently a mismatch
between the abilities of venture firms, which often make their biggest
returns on software startups, and the demands of climate tech. The
latter tends to require huge investments in physical infrastructure and
support for first-of-a-kind projects, and generally has a longer
timeline to profitability than, say, an app. “Venture funding, in some
sense, was built for scaling software companies,” Lara Pierpoint,
managing director of the
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240418137137/en/Prime-Coalition-Announces-Trellis-Climate-to-Accelerate-Deployment-of-First-of-a-Kind-Climate-Projects-Through-Catalytic-Capital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
catalytic capital program</u></a> Trellis Climate, told me. “You’re
talking about a capital light business that generally is creating
something that enters a white space, and for which there’s huge amounts
of market potential.”
</p>
<p>
It’s much more difficult to build expensive infrastructure that aims to
displace fossil fuel facilities and the entire economy that relies on
the cheap, reliable power they provide. So while VCs may be enthusiastic
about taking a relatively small financial bet on a high-potential
early-stage company, that may be all they’re able to do.
</p>
<p>
Trellis, on the other hand, is a part of the climate nonprofit Prime
Coalition and funds first-of-a-kind climate projects with philanthropic
capital. The nonprofit structure and philanthropy-focused funding model
mean that Trellis can take a different tack on missing middle financing
than traditional venture or equity investors. For example, Pierpoint
told me it can choose whether to invest in a company or just a specific
project. Trellis can also help de-risk projects by providing an
“insurance backstop” — basically backup capital in case primary project
funding falls short. “We’re looking at expanding the kinds of resources
and dollars we can bring to the table in general for the ecosystem,
because we think that venture can’t do this alone,” Pierpoint told me.
</p>
<p>
As with all nonprofits, generating big returns isn’t the focus for
Trellis. But for traditional investors, that’s the primary goal. And
while growth investments in more technically mature solutions are likely
to generate consistent returns, O’Sullivan told me they don’t often
provide the rarer but more alluring 10x returns that make early-stage
venture capital particularly enticing. “So it’s a more balanced
portfolio, typically, in that growth equity category. It’s just that you
don’t see the high highs,” he said, explaining that a two to 3x return
on investments is more realistic.
</p>
<p>
Brook Porter, a partner and co-founder at the growth-stage firm G2
Venture Partners, told me that focusing on the missing middle
<em><em>can</em></em> be extremely profitable, though, and that the key
to making real money is correctly identifying a company’s “inflection
point” — that is, when it’s poised for significant growth and impact.
That is, of course, every investor’s dream. But G2’s whole strategy
revolves around identifying exactly when this critical juncture will be,
tracking more than 2,000 companies per year to identify the ones best
poised for breakout scale-up.
</p>
<p>
The firm spun off in 2016 from Kleiner Perkins’ Green Growth Fund, where
Porter and his three co-founders previously worked as senior partners.
This is where they honed their theory of inflection point investing,
<a href="https://g2vp.com/portfolio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funding
companies</u></a> such as Uber, drone-maker DJI, and Enphase Energy.
Porter told me that helping startups move from proof-of-concept to
building “that machine of a business” requires a lot of hand-holding,
and that “there aren’t as many investors with that skill set,” so it
could take a while for this approach to scale.
</p>
<p>
On the other end of the funding spectrum, large institutional investors
like banks, hedge funds, and asset management firms certainly have the
money to help bridge the missing middle, but O’Sullivan and Pierpoint
told me they’re generally more interested in fulfilling their internal
climate mandates by building out more wind and solar, which generates
near-guaranteed returns. These investment giants then look at their
remaining cash and think, “Well, we should do something more avant
garde. Let’s put money into early-stage venture,” O’Sullivan explained.
That’s how many seed and Series A-focused funds raise money.
</p>
<p>
As O’Sullivan sees it, what’s happening now is “a flaw of the structure
of capital allocation at the very highest level.” He thinks we could
start by reorienting incentives such that large investors such as banks,
asset managers, and pension funds get paid in part for helping bring new
climate solutions to market, as opposed to just funding the same old,
same old. That would allow them to write “right-sized checks” on the
order of $50 million to $100 million to ready-to-scale companies —
larger than what a VC firm would write, but smaller than what the big
infrastructure investors are used to.
</p>
<p>
How would those alternate funding models actually work? Well, that’s the
real question. Pierpoint said she’s often asked whether a new kind of
investor or asset class will be necessary to fill the gap, and while she
doesn’t have an answer, what she does know is that the group of climate
tech companies that’s ready to commercialize “can’t wait 15 years until
we have the exact right form of capital.”
</p>
<p>
“There needs to be urgency on the part of philanthropists, on the part
of infrastructure equity investors, on the part of venture capitalists,
to really start showing that we can do this,” Pierpoint told me, “and
that we can bring together the right capital stacks to make this
happen.”

<p class="drop-caps">
For some reason, people keep moving to Phoenix. The population of
Maricopa County, which includes the city and its suburbs, was over 4.4
million in the 2020
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/maricopacountyarizona/PST045223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Census</u></a>,
double what it had been 30 years before. This is despite the fact that
you run the risk of bursting into flames simply by walking down the
street there; this summer, temperatures
<a href="http://phoenicians" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceeded</u></a>
100 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix for a stunning 113 straight days, and
in July
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2024/08/16/phoenix-heat-breaks-over-a-dozen-all-time-records-what-are-they/74831426007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
temperature reached</u></a> a balmy 118.
</p>
<p>
Climate hasn’t been as hot an issue in Arizona this year as immigration,
though the candidates for an open Senate seat have
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/shes-in-denial-gallego-lake-clash-on-climate-water/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disagreed</u></a>
over the reality of climate change and how to deal with extreme heat.
(Democrat Ruben Gallego advocates emissions reductions and more nuclear
power; Republican Kari Lake says if we “Drill baby drill” then everyone
can keep running their air conditioners.) There is genuine uncertainty
about how long the state will
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/climate/arizona-phoenix-permits-housing-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
enough water</u></a> to supply its growing population, but when the
election is over it will be difficult to tell exactly how many votes
were moved by rising temperatures. Joe Biden was the first Democratic
presidential candidate to win Maricopa since Harry Truman, and the
slowly baking county is the most important battleground in that
battleground state.
</p>
<p>
While climate may have seemed like a minor consideration amid all the
talk of fascism, abortion bans, and fictional pet-eating this election
cycle, in some of the states where the election will be decided, it’s
still a vital issue. Particularly when a few thousand votes can
determine who wins — as will probably be the case in multiple states —
it could be far more important than most people realize.
</p>
<p>
In fact, in most of the battlegrounds, one can identify a climate issue
that is profoundly affecting lives and the economy — and might or might
not nudge the election results one way or another. The most obvious case
may be North Carolina, where the western part of the state was ravaged
by Hurricane Helene. In the aftermath, it became clear that Asheville
was not the
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91200111/asheville-has-been-called-a-climate-haven-theres-no-such-thing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
refuge</u></a> some had believed it to be.
</p>
<p>
Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, is a blue island in a red
sea. And while officials scramble to make sure voting sites are
operable, Republicans in the state seem to think the hurricane has given
them an advantage, since they’ve used it to convince people (often with
false claims and conspiracy theories) that the federal government has
abandoned them. The county Democratic chair
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-trump-teams-scramble-votes-north-carolinas-hurricane-damaged-west-2024-10-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
Reuters</u></a> they’ve stopped knocking on Republican voters’ doors
because “we just don’t know about how volatile they might be.” No one is
sure how many people have lost access to voting sites due to the storm,
though one Republican congressman from Maryland
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-freedom-caucus-north-carolina-electors-00185520" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a>
that since many of the affected areas lean red, the state legislature
should just award its electoral votes to Trump.
</p>
<p>
Pennsylvania is another state where Republicans think the climate debate
will work in their favor. Both Trump and Senate candidate David
McCormick have put much of their emphasis on promoting fracking and
accusing their opponents of wanting to ban it, on the presumption that
the issue is a guaranteed winner. But the truth is that Pennsylvanians
are
<a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much
more ambivalent</u></a> about fracking than you might imagine, and there
are now more
<a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean
energy jobs</u></a> in the state than fracking jobs. The counties
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5d08b5d1dd7f4cbba594b193debf75dd#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-19083a7c8ba-layer-13%3A8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
dependent</u></a> on fossil fuel production — including McKean, Warren,
Venango (where Oil City is the largest town) and others — are small to
mid-sized, though heavily Republican; their votes are swamped by those
in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and their surrounding suburbs. It
wouldn’t be a stretch to think that if Harris wins, the frack attack
could fade in the same way coal has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>ceased</u></a>
to be a major campaign issue.
</p>
<p>
There are also places where climate politics are even more subtle.
Consider Bryan County, Georgia, a rapidly growing county not far from
Savannah. It has long been a Republican stronghold — Donald Trump got
two-thirds of the vote there in 2020 — but it’s also one of the jewels
in Georgia’s recent
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-georgia-became-green-manufacturing-capital-2024-3?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinvention</u></a>
as a center of green manufacturing. Production
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/hyundia-metaplant-has-started-production-ahead-of-schedule/ar-AA1rIAKb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just
began</u></a> at the local Hyundai “Metaplant” in the county, where
1,400 workers are building electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Will people in a place where the local economy increasingly revolves
around green manufacturing vote again for a candidate who wants to
rescind the subsidies that allow consumers to buy the very vehicles they
and their neighbors are making? It’s difficult to predict. But the
Republicans who run the state, especially Gov. Brian Kemp, have worked
hard to promote Georgia as a green tech hub while tiptoeing around any
talk of climate change, in a way that hasn’t seemed to damage either
their political or economic fortunes.
</p>
<p>
The politics in these very different places show that economic
transitions can be fodder for arguments on both sides, progress can
produce backlash, and disaster can be exploited by almost anyone cynical
enough to do so. While advocates of climate action might hope that the
candidates who support their favored policies will inevitably have an
advantage as the effects of climate change grow in magnitude, that won’t
always be true.
</p>
<p>
It may be inevitable that over time, climate will become more central to
campaigns. But the ways it is playing out in this election, low-key
though they might be, could be a preview of things to come. The urgency
of the climate crisis won’t make the politics any simpler.

Quarter Pounder returns after E. coli testing rules out beef</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — McDonald’s announced Sunday that Quarter Pounders will
again be on its menu at hundreds of its restaurants after testing ruled
out beef patties as the source of the outbreak of E. coli poisoning tied
to the popular burgers that killed one person and sickened at least 75
others across 13 states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that
slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of
contamination, McDonald’s said in a statement. It said it will resume
selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants — without slivered
onions — in the coming week.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the outbreak had expanded to at least 75 people sick in
13 states, federal health officials said. A total of 22 people had been
hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person has died
in Colorado.</p>
<p>Early information analyzed by the FDA showed that uncooked slivered
onions used on the burgers “are a likely source of contamination,” the
agency said. McDonald’s has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a
California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions
used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come
from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>McDonald’s pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several
states — mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states — when the outbreak
was announced Tuesday. McDonald’s said Friday that slivered onions from
the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of
its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like
airports.</p>
<p>The company said it removed slivered onions sourced from that
facility from its supply chain on Tuesday. McDonald’s said it has
decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs
facility “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>The 900 McDonald’s restaurants that normally received slivered onions
from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of
Quarter Pounders without slivered onions, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>Testing by the Colorado Department of Agriculture ruled out beef
patties as the source of the outbreak, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture received multiple lots of fresh and
frozen beef patties collected from various Colorado McDonald’s locations
associated with the E. coli investigation. All samples were found to be
negative for E. coli, the department said.</p>
<p>Taylor Farms said Friday that it had preemptively recalled yellow
onions sent to its customers from its Colorado facility and continues to
work with the CDC and the FDA as they investigate.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear if the recalled onions were the source of
the outbreak, several other fast-food restaurants — including Taco Bell,
Pizza Hut, KFC and Burger King — pulled onions from some menus in
certain areas this week.</p>
<p>Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases.
At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in
New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan and
one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington, the CDC
reported.</p>
<p>McDonald’s said Friday it didn’t pull the Quarter Pounder from any
additional restaurants and noted that some cases in states outside the
original region were tied to travel.</p>
<p>The CDC said some people who got sick reported traveling to other
states before their symptoms started. At least three people said they
ate at McDonald’s during their travel. Illnesses were reported between
Sept. 27 and Oct. 11.</p>
<p>The outbreak involves infections with E. coli 0157:H7, a type of
bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin. It causes about 74,000
infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000
hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to CDC.</p>
<p>Symptoms of E. coli poisoning can occur quickly, within a day or two
of eating contaminated food. They typically include fever, vomiting,
diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and signs of dehydration — little or no
peeing, increased thirst and dizziness. The infection is especially
dangerous for children younger than 5, people who are elderly, pregnant
or who have weakened immune systems.</p>

European countries match US in startup-friendly laws, report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Seven European countries have changed their laws to
increase employee ownership in startups to rival the U.S. in attracting
talent and investment, while other countries are lagging, a report by
venture capital firm Index Ventures found.</p>
<p>While stock options were integral to Silicon Valley’s success, Europe
has been hampered by bureaucracy and by taxing employees too early,
among other restrictions.</p>
<p>The European Union needs a coordinated industrial policy, rapid
decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace with the U.S.
and China economically, Mario Draghi said in a long awaited report last
month.</p>
<p>Over 500 startup CEOs and founders joined a campaign called “Not
Optional” in 2019 to change rules that govern employee ownership — the
practice of giving staff options to acquire a slice of the company, as
European-based companies compete for talent with U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Portugal and the UK lead European countries in
making changes that match or exceed those of the U.S., while Finland,
Switzerland, Norway and Sweden got lower ratings in the Index
report.</p>
<p>When companies such as Revolut and others go public, that ownership
translates into real money for employees, said Martin Mignot, a partner
at Index and an investor at fintech Revolut, which is valued at $45
billion.</p>

sports betting ballot measure highlights national debate about tax
rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The ads promoting a November ballot measure to
legalize sports betting in Missouri tout the potential for millions of
new tax dollars devoted to schools. If voters approve the measure, it’s
a good bet they will see even more ads offering special promotions for
bettors. </p>
<p>Many of those promotional costs — in which sportsbooks provide
cash-like credits for customers to place bets — will be exempt from
state taxes, effectively limiting the new revenue for education. </p>
<p>The Missouri ballot measure highlights an emerging debate among
policymakers over how to tax the rapidly growing industry, which has
spread from one state — Nevada — to 38 states and Washington, D.C.,
since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to legalized sports
wagering in 2018. </p>
<p>“It’s a fledging industry,” said Brent Evans, an assistant finance
professor at Georgia College &amp; State University who has taught
classes on gambling. “So nobody really knows what is a reasonable
tax.” </p>
<p>Since authorizing sports betting, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and
Washington, D.C., all have already raised or restructured their tax
rates. And Colorado and Virginia have pared back the tax deductions they
originally allowed. </p>
<p>Tax rates range from a low of 6.75% in states such Iowa to 51% in
states such as New York. That tax gap is even wider, because Iowa allows
promotional bets to be deducted from taxable revenue while New York does
not. </p>
<p>About half the states allow tax deductions for promotional costs.
It’s a common way of enticing people to start — or continue — making
bets. But in the short-term, it also can decrease the tax revenue
available for governments and schools. </p>
<p>Missouri’s proposed 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue is below
the national average of 19% that sportsbooks paid to states last year.
Because of deductions for “free play,” there could be some months in
which sportsbooks owe nothing to the state. Missouri’s proposed
constitutional amendment acknowledges that possibility, stating that
negative balances can be carried over from one month to the next until
revenue rises enough to owe taxes. </p>
<p>Unlike in some states, Missouri’s amendment caps the amount of
promotional credits that can be deducted from taxable revenue, at 25% of
all wagers. But it appears unlikely that cap would come into play. An
analysis conducted by consultant Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming for
amendment supporters projects promotional bets will comprise around 8%
of total wagers in Missouri’s first year of sports betting, declining
after that. </p>
<p>The Missouri proposal “is very much in line with what has worked and
been effective in other states,” said Jack Cardetti, a spokesman for
Winning for Missouri Education, the group backing the measure. </p>
<p>After voters narrowly approved it, Colorado launched sports betting
in 2020 with a 10% tax rate and full deductions for promotional bets. It
logged $2.7 billion of total bets during its first full fiscal year,
yielding $8.1 million in taxes, just slightly below legislative
projections. But Colorado changed its law starting in 2023 to cap
promotional tax deductions at 2.5% of total bets, gradually declining to
1 .75% by July 2026. </p>
<p>Colorado’s sports betting tax revenue has since risen to over $30
million in its most recent fiscal year. That growth led lawmakers to
place a proposal on the November ballot seeking permission for the state
to keep more than the original $29 million limit on sports betting tax
revenue. </p>
<p>Capping tax deductions for promotional bets is a good step, said
Richard Auxier, a principal policy associate at the nonprofit Tax Policy
Center. But he questions why some states exempt them from taxes in the
first place. </p>
<p>“We don’t give out free samples of cannabis when a state legalizes
cannabis,” Auxier said. “Is this something you want to be subsidizing
through your state tax policy — to encourage people to gamble?” </p>
<p>The Missouri amendment was placed on the November ballot by
initiative petition after legislation to legalize sports betting
repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. The $43 million campaign — a
record for a Missouri ballot measure — has been been funded entirely by
DraftKings and FanDuel, which dominate the nationwide sports betting
marketplace. If the measure passes, the companies could apply for two
statewide licenses to conduct online sports betting. The amendment
authorizes additional sports betting licenses for Missouri casinos and
professional sports teams. </p>
<p>The $14 million opposition campaign has been funded entirely by
Caesars Entertainment, which operates three of Missouri’s 13 casinos.
Although Caesars generally supports sports betting, it opposes “the way
this measure is written,” said Brooke Foster, a spokesperson for the
opposition group Missourians Against the Deceptive Online Gambling
Amendment. </p>
<p>In some other states, sports betting is run through casinos. Though
research is limited, a study of seven states released last year found
that casino gambling revenue declined as online sports betting
increased. </p>
<p>“There will definitely be a shift from placing bets in a physical
space with a Missouri incorporated casino versus hopping on an app in
your living room,” Foster said. </p>
<p>The effect of different tax rates can be seen in Illinois and New
Jersey, which spearheaded the court challenge leading to widespread
legal sports betting. People in each state placed between $11.5 billion
and $12 billion of sports bets last year, resulting in $1 billion of
revenue for sportsbooks after winnings were paid to customers, according
to figures from the American Gaming Association. </p>
<p>New Jersey took in $129 million in tax revenue, based on a 14.25% tax
rate for online sports bets and a 9.75% tax rate with some promotional
deductions for sports bets at casinos and racetracks. Illinois took in
$162 million of tax revenue — one-quarter more than New Jersey — with a
15% tax rate in most places and no promotional deductions. </p>
<p>But Illinois officials weren’t satisfied with those results.
Beginning in July, Illinois imposed a progressive tax scale, starting
with a 20% tax on sports betting revenue of less than $30 million and
rising to a 40% rate on revenue exceeding $200 million. </p>
<p>Some sportsbooks representatives had raised the possibility of
leaving Illinois if tax rates rose. But that hasn’t happened. </p>
<p>There’s also not much evidence that sportsbooks worsen the odds for
wagers in states where they pay higher taxes, said Joe Weinert,
executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting
firm. </p>
<p>“The sports betting operators compete vigorously for bettors,” he
said, “and how you compete vigorously is to offer attractive odds and
good promotions.”</p>

id="how-to-prepare-for-potential-health-effects-of-upcoming-end-to-daylight-saving-time">How
to prepare for potential health effects of upcoming end to daylight
saving time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad:
It’ll be dark as a pocket by late afternoon for the next few months in
the U.S. </p>
<p>Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time next Sunday, Nov. 3,
which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed.
Standard time will last until March 9 when we will again “spring
forward” with the return of daylight saving time. </p>
<p>That spring time change can be tougher on your body. Darker mornings
and lighter evenings can knock your internal body clock out of whack,
making it harder to fall asleep on time for weeks or longer. Studies
have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the
March time change. </p>
<p>“Fall back” should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust
your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the
dark or trying exercise while there’s still enough light. Some people
with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to
the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle,
too. </p>
<p>Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and
American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it’s time to do away with
time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with
the sun — and human biology. </p>
<p>Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do
— mostly in Europe and North America — the date that clocks are changed
varies. </p>
<p>Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don’t change and stay on standard
time. </p>
<p>Here’s what to know about the twice yearly ritual. </p>
<p>How the body reacts to light </p>
<p>The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and
darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that
determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns
change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into
hard-to-wake teens. </p>
<p>Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone
called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light
in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that
surge and the cycle gets out of sync. </p>
<p>And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing
things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and
metabolism. </p>
<p>How do time changes affect sleep? </p>
<p>Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules —
because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay
the same. </p>
<p>That’s a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived.
About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus
hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don’t get the
recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline,
obesity and numerous other problems. </p>
<p>How to prepare for the time change </p>
<p>Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their
bed times little by little in the days before the change. There are ways
to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset
your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. </p>
<p>Will the U.S. ever get rid of the time change? </p>
<p>Lawmakers occasionally propose getting rid of the time change
altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan
bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, proposes making daylight saving
time permanent. Health experts say the lawmakers have it backward —
standard time should be made permanent.</p>

id="biden-marks-anniversary-of-pittsburgh-synagogue-attack-that-killed-11">Biden
marks anniversary of Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden on Sunday marked the sixth
anniversary of a gunman’s deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue and
called out what he called an “appalling surge of antisemitism” amid the
war in Gaza. </p>
<p>The 2018 attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash,
New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the
synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.
Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in
the attack, the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that the attack “shattered families,
pierced the heart of the Jewish community, and struck the soul of our
nation.” But he said that in the years since, the Jewish community “has
also shown the country how to courageously turn pain into purpose”
launching “a global initiative to counter hate and hate-fueled
violence.” </p>
<p>Biden noted that the remembrance of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack
comes weeks after the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel “during
which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage and
committed horrific acts of sexual assault.” </p>
<p>He said the trauma and losses of Oct. 7 are made worse by “the
appalling surge of antisemitism against Jews in America and around the
world.” </p>
<p>The attack sparked a war between Israel and the militant group Hamas
and has resulted in widespread destruction and civilian deaths in
Gaza. </p>
<p>Biden said his administration was implementing a national strategy to
counter antisemitism, including securing $1.2 billion for security of
nonprofits such as synagogues and Jewish community centers and day
schools. He also cited the Justice Department’s investigation and
prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and said his administration had
“put colleges on notice that antisemitism is discrimination” and barred
under laws protecting civil rights. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris also cited a rise in antisemitism in a
statement marking the anniversary of the Pittsburgh attack. </p>
<p>“I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish
people in the United States and around the world and will always call
out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it,” she said. </p>
<p>The Pittsburgh attacker was sentenced to death last year after being
convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. </p>
<p>In June, ground was broken for a new complex on the Pittsburgh site
that is to include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and
museum along with a memorial to the slain worshipers from three
congregations.</p>

id="on-navajo-nation-push-to-electrify-more-homes-on-vast-reservation">On
Navajo Nation, push to electrify more homes on vast reservation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HALCHITA, Utah — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky
Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the
sprawling Navajo Nation. </p>
<p>In five days’ time, their home would be connected to the power grid,
replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No
longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home
heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face
interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis
can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an
evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. </p>
<p>“We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,” Gillis
said. </p>
<p>Many Navajo families still live without running water and
electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get
services to far-flung homes on the 70,000-square-kilometer
(27,000-square-mile) Native American reservation that lies in parts of
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators,
which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. </p>
<p>Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in
2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and
everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation,
it further stalled the process. </p>
<p>Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every
Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal
infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest
intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. </p>
<p>“We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left
out,” said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal
Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric,
water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. </p>
<p>For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more
Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light
Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside
utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes
and extend power lines. </p>
<p>But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West
Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and
the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can
take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes
near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet
strict regulations around development in the area. </p>
<p>About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the
remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said
Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the
utility. </p>
<p>This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid.
Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their
homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could
take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. </p>
<p>Until this month, Black and Gillis’ solar panels that the utility
installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before
their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days
to recharge. </p>
<p>“You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a
cloudy day,” Gillis said. </p>
<p>Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power
poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in
which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a
red sand road from the main power line to the couple’s home. </p>
<p>“The lights are brighter,” Black remarked after her home was
connected. </p>
<p>In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated
for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32
billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo
Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal
utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration’s
climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families
to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that
money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. </p>
<p>Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another
150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. </p>
<p>For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo
Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12-year wait. They currently live
in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs but have worked
on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could
spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still
lives. </p>
<p>It would make life simpler, Priscilla said. “Because otherwise,
everything, it seems like, takes twice as long to do.”</p>

id="venom-the-last-dance-misses-projections-as-superhero-films-grip-on-theaters-loosens">‘Venom:
The Last Dance’ misses projections as superhero films’ grip on theaters
loosens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “Venom: The Last Dance” showed less bite than expected at
the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according
to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote
franchise’s previous entries.</p>
<p>Projections for the third “Venom” film from Sony Pictures had been
closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from
the first two “Venom” films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2
million, while the 2021 follow-up, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” opened
with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>“The Last Dance,” starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his
body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a
profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and
marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most
comic-book films.</p>
<p>But “The Last Dance” is also performing better overseas.
Internationally, “Venom: The Last Dance” collected $124 million over the
weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China.
That’s good enough for one of the best international weekends of the
year for a Hollywood release.</p>
<p>Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience
scores (a franchise-low “B-” CinemaScore) have been good for the film
scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel.</p>
<p>The low weekend for “Venom: The Last Dance” also likely insures that
superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years,
not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a
film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise
Entertainment.</p>
<p>Following on the heels of the “Joker: Folie à Deux” flop, Gross
estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion
worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel’s “Kraven the Hunter,” due
out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,”
the genre hasn’t, overall, been dominating the way it once did. In 2018,
for example, superhero films accounted for more than $7 billion in
global ticket sales.</p>
<p>Last week’s top film, the Paramount Pictures horror sequel “Smile 2,”
dropped to second place with $9.4 million. That brings its two-week
total to $83.7 million worldwide.</p>
<p>The weekend’s biggest success story might have been “Conclave,” the
papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes and directed by Edward Berger
(“All Quiet on the Western Front”). The Focus Features release, a major
Oscar contender, launched with $6.5 million in 1,753 theaters.</p>
<p>That put “Conclave” into third place, making it the rare
adult-oriented drama to make a mark theatrically. Some 77% of ticket
buyers were over the age of 35, Focus said. With a strong opening and
stellar reviews, “Conclave” could continue to gather momentum both with
moviegoers and Oscar voters.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

<p>In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for charitable
organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday.</p>
<p>This year, GivingTuesday is on December 3.</p>
<p>How did GivingTuesday start?</p>
<p>The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y
in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It’s
grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote
giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local
relevance, such as holidays.</p>
<p>Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working
on topics about everyday giving. It collects data from a wide range of
sources such as payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving
software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of
charitable-giving account.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of GivingTuesday?</p>
<p>The hashtag was started to promote generosity, and the nonprofit
continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.</p>
<p>For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and
engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email
and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.
Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising
campaigns, and many smaller, local groups also participate.</p>
<p>Nonprofits don’t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday,
the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it,
although GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it
remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however
they like.</p>
<p>Has GivingTuesday been successful?</p>
<p>That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown
far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day
has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center
charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the United
States and around the world.</p>
<p>For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for
nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major
donors and leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is
the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to
reach their budget targets for the following year.</p>
<p>Donations on GivingTuesday in 2022 and 2023 reached $3.1 billion, an
increase from $2.7 billion in 2021. While that’s a lot to raise in a
single day, the trend last year was flat and with fewer donors giving,
which the organization said is a worrying sign.</p>

urban-rural divide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The divide between urban and rural voters is a key indicator in U.S.
electoral politics. Cities favoring Democrats and rural areas favoring
Republicans isn’t new. But since 2000, the gap has grown dramatically.
What is behind this trend, and why is it so important? The answer is
partly economic — but there are also complex cultural factors involved.

astronaut released from hospital after return from space station</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A NASA astronaut who was hospitalized upon return from
the International Space Station for an unspecified medical condition was
released Saturday in “good health,” the U.S. space agency said. </p>
<p>The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida
early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital
laboratory.   </p>
<p>NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the
reason, citing medical privacy.   </p>
<p>However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to
the Johnson Space Center in Houston “in good health and will resume
normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.”   </p>
<p>On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal
re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was
without incident, NASA said.   </p>
<p>But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an
“additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an
abundance of caution,” it added, without elaborating. </p>
<p>NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps,
and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were all flown to Ascension
Sacred Heart Pensacola.   </p>
<p>Three were subsequently released, while one remained at the hospital
“under observation as a precautionary measure.”</p>

<h2 id="war-affects-more-than-600-million-women-and-girls-un-says">War
affects more than 600 million women and girls, UN says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>united nations — More than 600 million women and girls are now
affected by war, a 50% increase from a decade ago, and they fear the
world has forgotten them amid an escalating backlash against women’s
rights and gender equality, top United Nations officials say. </p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a new report that
amid record levels of armed conflict and violence, progress over the
decades for women is vanishing and “generational gains in women’s rights
hang in the balance around the world.” </p>
<p>The U.N. chief was assessing the state of a Security Council
resolution adopted on Oct. 31, 2000, that demanded equal participation
for women in peace negotiations, a goal that remains as distant as
gender equality. </p>
<p>Guterres said current data and findings show that “the transformative
potential of women’s leadership and inclusion in the pursuit of peace”
is being undercut — with power and decision-making on peace and security
matters overwhelmingly in the hands of men. </p>
<p>“As long as oppressive patriarchal social structures and gender
biases hold back half our societies, peace will remain elusive,” he
warned. </p>
<p>The report says the proportion of women killed in armed conflicts
doubled in 2023 compared with a year earlier; U.N.-verified cases of
conflict-related sexual violence were 50% higher; and the number of
girls affected by grave violations in conflicts increased by 35%. </p>
<p>At a two-day U.N. Security Council meeting on the topic that ended
Friday, Sima Bahous, head of the U.N. agency promoting gender equality
known as UN Women, also pointed to a lack of attention to women’s voices
in the search for peace. </p>
<p>She cited the fears of millions of women and girls in Afghanistan
deprived of an education and a future; of displaced women in Gaza
“waiting for death”; of women in Sudan who are victims of sexual
violence; and of the vanishing hopes of women in Myanmar, Haiti, Congo,
the Sahel region of Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Bahous said the 612 million women and girls affected by war “wonder
if the world has already forgotten them, if they have fallen from the
agenda of an international community overwhelmed by crises of ever
deeper frequency, severity and urgency.” </p>
<p>The world needs to answer their fears with hope, she said, but the
reality is grim: “One in two women and girls in conflict-affected
settings are facing moderate to severe food insecurity, 61% of all
maternal mortality is concentrated in 35 conflict-affected
countries.” </p>
<p>As for women’s participation in decision-making and politics in
countries in conflict, Bahous said it’s stalled. </p>
<p>“The percentage of women in peace negotiations has not improved over
the last decade: under 10% on average in all processes, and under 20% in
processes led or supported by the United Nations,” she said. </p>
<p>U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed announced the launch of
a “Common Pledge on Women’s Participation in Peace Processes,” and urged
governments, regional organizations and others involved in mediation to
join the U.N. in taking concrete steps toward that end. The commitments
include appointing women as lead mediators and team members, promoting
direct and meaningful participation of women in peace processes,
consulting women leaders at all stages and embedding women with
expertise “to foster gender-responsive peace processes and agreements,”
she said. </p>
<p>Many U.N. ambassadors who spoke at the council meeting focused on the
lack of “political will” to promote women in the peace process. </p>
<p>“We’ve seen how the lack of political will continues to stand in the
way of the full implementation of the commitments entered into by member
states,” Panama’s U.N. Ambassador Eloy Alfaro de Alba said Friday.</p>

id="major-vatican-meeting-sidelines-talks-of-women-priests-deacons">Major
Vatican meeting sidelines talks of women priests, deacons</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome — A major Vatican meeting gathering clerics and laity across the
globe to discuss the future of the Catholic Church closes this weekend,
thwarting discussion of women becoming priests or deacons in the world’s
largest Christian denomination.</p>
<p>But that didn’t stop a half-dozen Catholic women from “ordination” in
a secret ceremony in Rome that was not authorized by the Vatican.</p>
<p>Jesuit Father Allan Deck, a professor at the Los Angeles-based Loyola
Marymount University, told VOA that the Catholic Church under Pope
Francis’ leadership recognizes the need for adaptability to realize its
spiritual mission in the world at this time of significant change.</p>
<p>“Not the first time that the church in its 2,000-year history has
experienced very significant shifts,” he said. “The church, in order to
accomplish its mission, has to engage people, circumstances and times.
And it has to be capable of development, while at the same time
remaining faithful to its mission and to the revelation that has been
communicated to it. This is hard. This is what’s happening.”</p>
<p>While Catholic women participated over the past month in what many
consider the most significant Catholic gathering since the 1960s —
called the “synod on synodality” — many of their number were let down by
a Vatican decision to sideline talk of the ordination of female priests
or deacons, instead referring the matter to a future study group.</p>
<p>Bridget Mary Meehan, an American co-founder of the Association of
Roman Catholic Women Priests, told VOA that her organization has
performed 270 ordinations of women in 14 countries since its creation in
2002.</p>
<p>“We wanted to share with Pope Francis that it is time to build a
bridge between the international women priests’ movement and the
Vatican,” she said. “We are on the same page as he is about a synodal
church. We believe all are called, all are equal and all are
co-responsible for the mission of the church — to be the face of Christ
in the world in loving and compassionate service. One of these ways is
ordained ministry.”</p>
<p>Advocates say women play a huge role in daily Catholic ministries —
also called the diakonia — in education, pastoral care and hospitals
worldwide. In some places, women are especially active because there are
no priests, such as in the Amazon. But often their leadership is not
recognized.</p>
<p>Meehan “ordained” six Catholic women from France, Spain and the
United States on a barge on Rome’s Tiber River earlier this month to
acknowledge their central role in ministry around the world.</p>
<p>“We did it because we felt that it’s time for us, after 22 years of
serving the church in the diakonia ministry, to really share the good
news that women are being ordained by Catholic communities who want to
call them forward to ministry among them,” Meehan said.</p>
<p>“It’s like a renewal of ministry that is already in the midst of the
Catholic Church. It’s already occurring,” she said.</p>
<p>Although Pope Francis has appointed more women to top jobs at the
Vatican than any of his predecessors, he has ruled out female priests or
deacons ministering in the Catholic Church.</p>

president secures 3rd term as China, US vie for Pacific leverage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Kiribati President Taneti Maamau, who has led the
Pacific Island nation to build closer ties with China in recent years,
secured his third term in office on Saturday. He defeated two other
candidates in an election closely monitored by countries around the
world.</p>
<p>Maamau won about 55% of the vote, while his nearest challenger,
Kaotitaaake Kokoria, won 42% of the vote, New Zealand’s High
Commissioner in Kiribati said. Kiribati’s chief justice, Tetiro
Semilota, declared Maamau the winner and congratulated him.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon became the first
international leader to congratulate Maamau for his victory on Saturday.
“We look forward to working with the Government of Kiribati to deliver
on our shared priorities,” he wrote in a post on social media platform
X.</p>
<p>Kiribati is one of the countries that relies heavily on foreign aid.
The cost of living, rising sea level and relations with China were the
main issues leading up to Friday’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Saturday’s outcome is viewed as the Kiribati voters’ endorsement of
policies Maamau’s government has implemented over the last four years,
including deepening the Pacific Island nation’s ties with China.</p>
<p>During the parliamentary election in August, the ruling Tobwaan
Kiribati Party, or TKP, secured 33 out of 44 seats in the new
parliament, and Maamau won his seat by winning close to 83% of the votes
in his district.</p>
<p>“The TKP has a very healthy majority [in the parliament], and it sort
of shows that the people of Kiribati want to see more of what has been
happening [over the last few years],” said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert
on Pacific-China relations at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p>
<p>Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019,
Kiribati has deepened its engagement with Beijing. The Maamau
administration’s efforts to elevate security ties with the Chinese
government have prompted concerns from partners such as Australia and
the United States.</p>
<p>In 2021, China helped Kiribati revamp a World War II-era airstrip on
the island of Kanton, which is less than 3,000 kilometers from Hawaii
and Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where major U.S. military
bases are located.</p>
<p>In February, Kiribati’s acting police commissioner, Eeri Aritiera,
revealed that Chinese police would help Kiribati’s community policing
program and IT department, raising concerns from the U.S. that the
cooperation could negatively impact Kiribati’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Some analysts say since China has ambitions to deepen its economic
and security reach in the Pacific region, Australia and the United
States are very concerned about any advancement in security relations
between Beijing and Pacific Island countries.</p>
<p>“It’s unclear how the policing arrangement with Kiribati will evolve
in Maamou’s next term, but it’s unlikely that Chinese engagement will
cease or decrease,” said Meg Keen, a senior fellow at Lowy Institute in
Australia.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, Szadziewski said Kiribati’s efforts to build
closer ties with China shouldn’t be viewed through a pure zero-sum lens.
“The Kiribati economy is heavily reliant on tourism and fishing, and
China has stepped up with infrastructure projects in that respect,” he
told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>But China’s engagement with Kiribati hasn’t been “all benevolence,”
Szadziewski said. “Kiribati has opened up its maritime domain for
increased Chinese fishing, so there is something in it for China that’s
economic,” he said.</p>
<p>During a reception celebrating the fifth anniversary of the
restoration of diplomatic ties between China and Kiribati, the Chinese
ambassador to Kiribati, Zhou Limin, said the relationship has further
consolidated and vowed to strengthen synergy between the two countries
in the future.</p>
<p>Under Maamau’s third term, Keen in Australia said, Kiribati will
likely maintain its close relationship with China while also trying to
seek assistance from other countries, such as Australia, to help improve
the country’s infrastructure and climate resilience.</p>
<p>“There’s no indication that the relationship with China will change
under another term for Maamau, and he will be seeking a strong legacy in
his final term by working with any development partner that can assist
with his ambitious development goals,” Keen told VOA in a written
response.</p>
<p>She added that most Pacific leaders don’t view maintaining relations
with China or other democratic countries such as Australia as “an
either/or choice.”</p>
<p>In response to China’s elevated relations with Kiribati, Australia
and the United States have also stepped up efforts to deepen ties with
the Pacific Islands nation.</p>
<p>In 2023, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced that
Canberra would “rapidly scale up” security and development with Kiribati
during her visit to the country. In February, the U.S. Coast Guard
conducted joint patrols with Kiribati in the country’s exclusive
economic zone.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, Szadziewski at the University of Hawaii said
it’s important for democratic countries to understand the priorities of
Pacific Island countries and try to engage with them on “equal
footing.”</p>
<p>“Pacific Island states have heightened sensitivity about sovereignty,
so they prefer to see exchanges with other states on an equal footing,”
he told VOA, adding that democratic countries should ensure the priority
of their engagement with Pacific Island countries is not solely about
geopolitics.</p>
<p>“If China is your main concern and why you are in the region, that’s
not going to be something of interest to the Pacific Island leaders,”
Szadziewski said.</p>
<p>In addition to the presidential election in Kiribati, Palau is going
to hold a general election on November 5, with the current president,
Surangel Whipps Jr., running against former president Tommy Remengesau
Jr. in a race that analysts say Beijing will be closely following.</p>
<p>Experts say competition for geopolitical influence between China and
the U.S. as well as its allies will intensify as countries try to engage
with winners emerging from these important elections in the Pacific
region.</p>
<p>“Election periods will always heighten activities, and competition
[between these countries] is only going to get more intense over the
next couple of years,” Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian
Strategic Policy Institute, told VOA by phone.</p>

id="us-navy-will-apologize-for-1882-obliteration-of-tlingit-village-in-alaska">US
Navy will apologize for 1882 obliteration of Tlingit village in
Alaska</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Shells fell on the Alaska Native village as winter approached, and
then sailors landed and burned what was left of homes, food caches and
canoes. Conditions grew so dire in the following months that elders
sacrificed their own lives to spare food for surviving children.</p>
<p>It was Oct. 26, 1882, in Angoon, a Tlingit village of about 420
people in the southeastern Alaska panhandle. Now, 142 years later, the
perpetrator of the bombardment — the U.S. Navy — is set to say it is
sorry.</p>
<p>Rear Adm. Mark Sucato, the commander of the Navy’s northwest region,
will issue the apology during a ceremony on Saturday, the anniversary of
the atrocity. While the rebuilt Angoon received $90,000 in a settlement
with the Department of Interior in 1973, village leaders have for
decades sought an apology as well, beginning each yearly remembrance by
asking three times, “Is there anyone here from the Navy to
apologize?”</p>
<p>“You can imagine the generations of people that have died since 1882
that have wondered what had happened, why it happened, and wanted an
apology of some sort, because in our minds, we didn’t do anything
wrong,” said Daniel Johnson Jr., a tribal head in Angoon.</p>
<p>The attack was one of a series of conflicts between the American
military and Alaska Natives in the years after the U.S. bought the
territory from Russia in 1867. The U.S. Navy issued an apology last
month for destroying the nearby village of Kake in 1869, and the Army
has indicated that it plans to apologize for shelling Wrangell, also in
southeast Alaska, that year, though no date has been set.</p>
<p>The Navy acknowledges the actions it undertook or ordered in Angoon
and Kake caused deaths, a loss of resources and multigenerational
trauma, Navy civilian spokesperson Julianne Leinenveber said in an
email.</p>
<p>“An apology is not only warranted, but long overdue,” she said.</p>
<p>Today, Angoon remains a quaint village of about 420 people, with
colorful old homes and totem poles clustered on the west side of
Admiralty Island, accessible by ferry or float plane, in the Tongass
National Forest, the nation’s largest. The residents are vastly
outnumbered by brown bears, and the village in recent years has strived
to foster its ecotourism industry. Bald eagles and humpback whales
abound, and the salmon and halibut fishing is excellent.</p>
<p>Accounts vary as to what prompted its destruction, but they generally
begin with the accidental death of a Tlingit shaman, Tith Klane. Klane
was killed when a harpoon gun exploded on a whaling ship owned by his
employer, the North West Trading Co.</p>
<p>The Navy’s version says tribal members forced the vessel to shore,
possibly took hostages and, in accordance with their customs, demanded
200 blankets in compensation.</p>
<p>The company declined to provide the blankets and ordered the Tlingits
to return to work. Instead, in sorrow, they painted their faces with
coal tar and tallow — something the company’s employees took as a
precursor to an insurrection. The company’s superintendent then sought
help from Naval Cmdr. E.C. Merriman, the top U.S. official in Alaska,
saying a Tlingit uprising threatened the lives and property of white
residents.</p>
<p>The Tlingit version contends the boat’s crew, which included Tlingit
members, likely remained with the vessel out of respect, planning to
attend the funeral, and that no hostages were taken. Johnson said the
tribe never would have demanded compensation so soon after the
death.</p>
<p>Merriman arrived on Oct. 25 and insisted the tribe provide 400
blankets by noon the next day as punishment for disobedience. When the
Tlingits turned over just 81, Merriman attacked, destroying 12 clan
houses, smaller homes, canoes and the village’s food stores.</p>
<p>Six children died in the attack, and “there’s untold numbers of
elderly and infants who died that winter of both cold, exposure and
hunger,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Billy Jones, Tith Klane’s nephew, was 13 when Angoon was destroyed.
Around 1950, he recorded two interviews, and his account was later
included in a booklet prepared for the 100th anniversary of the bombing
in 1982.</p>
<p>“They left us homeless on the beach,” Jones said.</p>
<p>Rosita Worl, the president of Sealaska Heritage Institute in Juneau,
described how some elders that winter “walked into the forest” — meaning
they died, sacrificing themselves so the younger people would have more
food.</p>
<p>Even though the Navy’s written history conflicts with the Tlingit
oral tradition, the Navy defers to the tribe’s account “out of respect
for the long-lasting impacts these tragic incidents had on the affected
clans,” said Leinenveber, the Navy spokesperson.</p>
<p>Tlingit leaders were so stunned when Navy officials told them, during
a Zoom call in May, that the apology would finally be forthcoming that
no one spoke for five minutes, Johnson said.</p>
<p>Eunice James, of Juneau, a descendant of Tith Klane, said she hopes
the apology helps her family and the entire community heal. She expects
his presence at the ceremony.</p>
<p>“Not only his spirit will be there, but the spirit of many of our
ancestors, because we’ve lost so many,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="in-suburban-miami-kmarts-last-blue-light-specials-flicker">In
suburban Miami, Kmart’s last ‘Blue Light Specials’ flicker</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — The last Kmart on the U.S. mainland sits at the west
end of a busy suburban Miami shopping center, quiet and largely
ignored.</p>
<p>All around it are thriving chain stores attracting steady streams of
customers in sectors where the former box-store chain was once a major
player: Marshalls, Hobby Lobby, PetSmart and Dollar Tree.</p>
<p>But at this all-but-last outpost of a company once famed for its
“Blue Light Specials,” only an occasional shopper pops in, mostly out of
curiosity or nostalgia, then leaves after buying little or nothing.</p>
<p>“I hadn’t seen Kmart in so long,” said Juan de la Madriz, who came to
the shopping center on a recent weekday to buy dog food at PetSmart. The
architect spotted the Kmart and wondered if he could find a gift for his
newborn grandson. He exited 10 minutes later having spent $23 on a
stuffed dog and a wooden toy workbench.</p>
<p>“It will be sad if it closes,” he said about the store, “but
everything now is on computers.”</p>
<p>The last full-size Kmart in the 50 states closed Sunday in Long
Island, New York, making the Miami store — now a fraction of its former
size — the last operating in the continental United States. At its peak
30 years ago, Kmart operated about 2,500 locations. Today, four others
remain: three in the U.S. Virgin Islands and one in Guam. There is also
a website.</p>
<p>Transformco, the Illinois-based holding company that owns Kmart and
what’s left of another former retail behemoth, Sears, did not respond to
email requests for comment or allow the store manager to speak. The
company’s plans for the Miami location are unknown — but there is no
indication it will close soon.</p>
<p>The last outpost</p>
<p>If the Miami Kmart were a brand-new mom-and-pop retailer, a shopper
might think it could eventually thrive with advertising and a little
luck. Kmart long had a reputation for clutter and mess, but this store
is immaculate, and the merchandise is precisely stacked and
displayed.</p>
<p>The size of a CVS or Walgreens drug store, the branch occupies what
was its garden section during its big-box days. A couple years ago, an
At Home department store took over the rest of the space.</p>
<p>“Get it all! Must Haves. Wish Fors. Friendly Faces,” the sign next to
the door reads.</p>
<p>Halloween and Christmas decorations line the entryway, next to the 30
shopping carts that no one is using. A robotic voice says “Welcome,” as
does a cheery employee, one of three spotted in the store. A lone
customer checks out the Halloween candy.</p>
<p>Straight ahead are a few dishwashers, refrigerators, washing machines
and dryers: the appliance department. In the store’s main room, there is
a large section of toiletries and diapers, a few hardware essentials and
some cleaning and pet supplies. The toy department comprises a couple
rows of dolls, action figures, games and squirt guns. Sun dresses,
summer tops and sweatshirts make up the small clothing section. Oh, and
there are snacks.</p>
<p>Also still present: a recorded voice intoning a once-familiar message
over a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>“Attention Kmart shoppers,” it says, announcing that almost all items
are on sale.</p>
<p>If there were only customers to hear it, like there used to be.</p>
<p>A fast rise and a slow death</p>
<p>Kmart was founded by the retailer S.S. Kresge Company in Michigan in
1962 and grew quickly, reaching 2,000 stores in 20 years. The company
sold almost everything, from clothing to jewelry, TVs to dog food,
appliances to toys to sporting goods. By the mid-1980s, it was the
nation’s second-largest retailer behind Sears, and there were stores in
Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The roots of Kmart’s decline were laid during that decade when
management bought Waldenbooks, Borders Books, Builders Square, Sports
Authority and a stake in OfficeMax, thinking the company needed
diversification. They were wrong. By the late 1990s, the company had
sold those retailers yet still needed $5 billion in refinancing — the
equivalent of $9 billion today.</p>
<p>In 2002, Kmart declared bankruptcy as Walmart and Target devoured its
market share. Its website never took off, allowing Amazon to beat it in
the e-commerce space. There were executive pay scandals, a purchase by a
hedge fund manager who stripped it bare and a disastrous 2005
acquisition of Sears.</p>
<p>Mark Cohen, a former Sears Canada CEO and former director of retail
studies at Columbia University’s graduate school of business, said Kmart
would have thrived if not for the top executives who ran it into the
ground. It could have been Walmart.</p>
<p>“It sold in its heyday things that people continue to buy in large
quantities today,” Cohen said. “Kmart went down the drain because it was
led by incompetent managers.”</p>
<p>Transformco bought Kmart and Sears out of another bankruptcy in 2019
for $5 billion — its critics say mostly for the stores’ real estate.
There were 202 Kmarts remaining.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, the firm has kept closing Kmarts until all
that’s left in the states is Miami Store #3074.</p>
<p>Nostalgia does not translate into sales</p>
<p>On the day that de la Madriz dropped in to buy his grandson’s gift,
only a few customers trickled in and out of the store every hour.</p>
<p>College students Joey Fernandez and Wilfredo Huayhua spent five
minutes inside before leaving empty-handed. They knew about the chain’s
near-demise, spotted the store while in the shopping center and went in
to reminisce. It seemed small, they said, compared to the Kmarts they
remembered.</p>
<p>“We were bummed out — I spent a lot of my childhood at Kmart,” said
Fernandez, 18. Still, he might be back — the store has good prices on
the facial cleanser he uses.</p>
<p>Teacher Oliver Sequin had been entering Marshalls when he spotted the
Kmart. That, too, triggered nostalgia but also reminded him he needed
Band-Aids for his 5-year-old son. That was all he purchased.</p>
<p>“I remember when Kmarts were bigger,” Sequin said. “But, to be
honest, I like this one better. It is clean and organized, not like they
were.”</p>

<h2 id="us-missile-agency-scales-back-guam-defense-plans">US missile
agency scales back Guam defense plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A proposed multibillion-dollar missile defense system for Guam has
been reduced to 16 sites on the island from the original 22, the U.S.
Missile Defense Agency said in a draft environmental impact statement on
Friday.</p>
<p>The project is designed to create “360 degree” protection for the
U.S. Pacific territory from missile and air attacks of all kinds, the
agency said. Plans include integrating Raytheon’s SM-6, SM-3 Block IIA,
Lockheed Martin’s  THAAD, and the Patriot PAC-3, which uses components
from both companies, over about 10 years.</p>
<p>The environmental impact study, which began last year and included a
public comment period this year, proposes “deploying and operating and
maintaining a combination of integrated components for air and missile
defense positioned on 16 sites” on the island. The report does not say
why the number of sites was reduced.</p>
<p>All of the remaining 16 sites are on U.S. military property.</p>
<p>The project is crucial to the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific allies
because it provides a logistical hub far from U.S. shores - Guam is
closer to China than it is to Hawaii.</p>
<p>China’s massive conventional ballistic missile inventory includes the
DF-26, with an estimated range of about 4,000 km (2,500 miles), which
can also carry anti-ship and nuclear warheads. Newer weapons in
development, such as the hypersonic glide vehicle DF-27, are drawing
increased attention from U.S. military planners.</p>
<p>“It’s a forward operating base for long-range bombers, and a port for
ships, so that navy ships can sally forth from there,” said Peter
Layton, a defense and aviation expert at the Griffith Asia Institute in
Australia. “Certainly places in Japan and the Philippines are a lot
closer (to China)… but a lot more exposed.”</p>
<p>There will be public meetings in Guam next month to discuss Friday’s
report, the agency statement said.</p>

election key to Latin American economies, says credit rating agency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico city — The fate of Latin American economies, deeply reliant on
remittances from the United States, hangs in the balance with the
upcoming U.S. presidential elections, Fitch Ratings said on Friday.</p>
<p>Why it’s important</p>
<p>The potential disparity in immigration policies between the
Republican and Democratic administrations could significantly affect
Central American nations, which are heavily dependent on remittances
from the U.S.</p>
<p>Key comment</p>
<p>“Central America is highly vulnerable to U.S. immigration policies,
as remittances fund a large component of their economic activity,” said
Fitch, a U.S.-based credit rating agency.</p>
<p>In countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua, remittances currently
account for more than 30% of their gross domestic product, the ratings
agency said, adding that Mexico is also one of the largest recipients of
remittances globally, where inflows have steadily increased over the
past decade to close to 3.5% of GDP, from 2%.</p>
<p>By the numbers</p>
<p>Remittances to Nicaragua have tripled in the past five years, while
those to other countries, specifically El Salvador and Jamaica, have
considerably slowed.</p>
<p>A study based on data from the U.S. Current Population Survey showed
that a 1% increase in the country’s household earnings results in a 0.2%
to 0.3% increase in remittances sent abroad.</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>The U.S. elections could usher in changes in immigration policies,
with Donald Trump’s campaign showing a willingness to restrict border
crossings and increase deportations, while the potential Kamala Harris
administration would aim to pass a bipartisan law to reform the asylum
process and limit immigration parole.</p>
<p>Policy changes could significantly affect migrants and the Central
American economies that are heavily dependent on the money they send
back home from the United States.</p>

id="nasa-astronaut-hospitalized-upon-return-from-extended-stay-in-space">NASA
astronaut hospitalized upon return from extended stay in space</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA astronaut was taken to the hospital
for an undisclosed medical issue after returning from a nearly
eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing’s capsule trouble and
Hurricane Milton, the space agency said Friday.</p>
<p>A SpaceX capsule carrying three Americans and one Russian parachuted
before dawn into the Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after
undocking from the International Space Station at midweek. The capsule
was hoisted onto the recovery ship where the four astronauts had routine
medical checks.</p>
<p>Soon after splashdown, a NASA astronaut had a “medical issue” and the
crew was flown to a hospital in Pensacola, Florida, for additional
evaluation “out of an abundance of caution,” the space agency said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The astronaut, who was not identified, was in stable condition and
remained at the hospital as a “precautionary measure,” NASA said.</p>
<p>The space agency said it would not share details about the
astronaut’s condition, citing patient privacy.</p>
<p>The other three astronauts were discharged and returned to NASA’s
Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p>It can take days or even weeks for astronauts to readjust to gravity
after living in weightlessness for several months.</p>
<p>The astronauts should have been back two months ago. But their
homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing’s new Starliner astronaut
capsule, which came back empty in September because of safety concerns.
Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by another two weeks of high
wind and rough seas.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched the four — NASA’s Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt
and Jeanette Epps, and Russia’s Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt,
the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support
teams back home that had “to replan, retool and kind of redo everything
right along with us … and helped us to roll with all those punches.”</p>
<p>Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore
and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight
months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four
will remain up there until February.</p>
<p>The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four
Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow.</p>
