      <h1>A sign investors think the economy will remain strong</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Corporate bond spreads, extra compensation that corporate bonds pay out compared to government bonds, have been narrowing this year, which means investors aren’t demanding much additional money to account for additional credit risk. That could indicate that investors think economic growth could pick up in the near term. Also on the program: a trade deal regarding U.K. pharmaceuticals and OPEC's plans to keep oil production flat to start the new year.</p>

<p>The historic gift has little precedent, with few single charitable commitments in the past 25 years exceeding $1bn, much less multiple billions. Announced on GivingTuesday, the Dells believe it’s the largest single private commitment made to US children.</p>

      <h1>How far away are we from humanoid robots doing our chores?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Robots are commonplace in factories, and increasingly in warehouses like those run by Amazon. But what about robots to help with household chores — so-called humanoids to load the dishwasher or fold the laundry?</p>
<p>To find out, we checked in with Ken Goldberg, professor of engineering at UC Berkeley and co-founder of the AI and robotics company Ambi Robotics. He spoke to Marketplace’s Nova Safo en route from a robotics conference in China.</p>

<p>The revelation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/trinidad-and-tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> has approved the installation of a US military radar installation has stoked fears that the Caribbean could be drawn into the escalating crisis between the US and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had attempted to allay concerns about a US C-17 aircraft that had landed in the country, claiming it was carrying marines to assist with a road construction project. She also claimed she was told that no marines remained in the country.</p>

      <p>Your essential guide to Friday’s draw in Washington DC, including where to watch it, who to watch out for and a look at Fifa’s peace prize</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a> draw will start at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center at 12pm local time on Friday 5 December (5pm GMT/4am Saturday AEST). Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.</p>

      <h1>Fuzzy Zoeller obituary</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Popular American golfer hailed for winning the US Masters and the US Open</p>
<p>The golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who has died aged 74, won two majors – the US Masters in 1979 and the US Open in 1984, both by virtue of a playoff. His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC-pC_S6aTs">high into the air</a> as the ball disappeared into the cup.</p>
<p>Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6_Mx9YmgU">mock surrender</a>. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq6SG_Qzpxg">flapping</a> his own white towel at the 18th.</p>

These are judges that businesses or individuals resort to when traditional courts are too slow, too expensive, or too time-consuming. But first, AI is helping out with our holiday shopping. Adobe Analytics says traffic to retail websites that originated from AI tools like chatbots was up 805% compared to last year.</p>

<p>Voters on Tuesday will cast ballots in a special election to replace Mark Green, a Republican representing a middle Tennessee district who resigned from Congress in July.

      <h1>Factory output in China falls yet again</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Factories in China have long been an engine of economic growth, so it's worrying for leaders in Beijing that a new survey shows activity unexpectedly contracted in November. It's the eighth straight month that production has shrunk. What's it telling us about the world's second biggest economy? And later, Iran is experiencing an unprecedented drought, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water.</p>

      <h1>Purists be damned: why title-deciding playoffs make soccer sing | Leander Schaerlaeckens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>In MLS and NWSL alike, edge-of-your-seat contests have delivered indelible moments that even the best title race run-in can’t match</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx6vDNKVAo">a TV commercial</a> that’s been running on Apple TV during MLS games for Lowe’s hardware stores. Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).</p>
<p>Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/24/lionel-messi-mls-viewership-attendance-apple-tv">smashed up the league</a> this year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.</p>

      <h1>In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contenders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>San Francisco are a flawed team with serious injuries. But with no great teams in the league this year, the playoffs are wide open</p>
<p>The 49ers’ season felt over after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers">Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay</a>. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner <a href="https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/">was the latest casualty</a>, following <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php">in the footsteps</a> of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.</p>
<p>Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Donald Trump declared on Truth Social that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed. Venezuela’s foreign ministry responded by calling the comments &quot;another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people&quot;.
Late last week, Trump also said that land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in the country could start very soon.
All of this is happening amidst a serious military buildup in the Caribbean and escalating threats to remove Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro from power.
Is this the buildup to an invasion? And is it really about drugs? Or do Venezuela's massive oil reserves have something to do with it?
Jon Lee Anderson is our guest. He’s a staff writer with The New Yorker, and has written extensively about U.S.-Venezuela relations and U.S. interference in Latin America.

Urgences-santé, meanwhile, insists there’s been no impact on patient care since the system was implemented.</p>

<p>During the third-quarter of Sunday’s game between the Commanders and Broncos, the Washington receiver reached behind him as he fell backwards in the end zone and grabbed a Marcus Mariota pass with his right hand.

<li>
<p>Bryce Young excels in Carolina victory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bills QB scores record 76th rushing touchdown</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bryce Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns – two of them coming on fourth down – and the Carolina Panthers (7-6) forced three turnovers by Matthew Stafford to beat Los Angeles (9-3) and snap the Rams’ six-game winning streak. Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.</p>

      <h1>A teenager redrew the Alabama voting map – and it’s now state law</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>Daniel DiDonato, 18, drafted new state senate districts at home on free software – and a judge picked his map ahead of professionals’ efforts to remedy voting rights violations</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after years of litigation, a federal judge in Alabama ordered a new state senate map. In a surprising decision, the map she chose wasn’t one drafted by a court-appointed special master and his expert cartographer, but rather one that had been submitted by an anonymous member of the public, known only by their initials, “DD”.</p>
<p>The decision stunned “DD” – an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama named Daniel DiDonato – who learned his map had been selected as he was preparing to leave for his 9.30am introduction to political science class.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Parts of the US economy are doing just fine but many are struggling to make rent, let alone splurging on gifts</p>
<p>Will retailers and merchants have a strong holiday season? That depends. This year, more than most, the 2025 holiday season will actually be two holiday seasons.</p>
<p>If your business caters to higher-income individuals or if you’re located in a wealthier part of the country, you’ll probably have a decent holiday season. True, even the wealthy are cutting back. But according to the HR firm ADP average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/economic-opportunity/household-income">some parts of the country</a>, notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income is over <span class="math inline">\(125,000 - almost \)</span>41,000 higher than the national average. People in this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.</p>

      <p>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms</p>
<p>The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.</p>
<p>Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">pushes</a> aggressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/">CRCL document</a> confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.</p>
<p>Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">document</a>.This included an investigation into a <a href="https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/">2024 incident</a> during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">complaint</a>, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.</p>
<p>In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf">complaint</a> submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.</p>
<p>Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf">complaint</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>From Vietnam to the Balkans, Donald Trump’s family has launched a global dealmaking blitz since his re-election</p>
<p>A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.</p>
<p>All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.</p>

So this week, the EU announced plans to ban social media platforms from providing financial or material incentives for kidfluencing. Experts says Canada needs to come up with its own law.</p>

      <p>
      <p>President made declaration in a social media post, after FAA last week warned airlines of ‘worsening security situation’</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government has responded defiantly to the heightened pressure by the US government, including Donald Trump’s recent statements on Saturday that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela is to be closed in its entirety.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Venezuelan government said Trump’s comments are a “colonialist threat” against their sovereignty and violate international law. The government also said it demanded respect for its airspace and would not accept foreign orders or threats.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s administration had cut off $790m in grants in a standoff that contributed to university layoffs and the resignation in September of Northwestern’s president, Michael Schill. The administration argued the school had not done enough to fight antisemitism.</p>

      <p>People implicated in the late sex offender’s crimes could face criminal charges or, at the least, social ostracism</p>
<p>As the clock ticks toward the congressionally mandated deadline of 19 December by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release its files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, there is intense speculation about the contents of these documents – but also questions as to what happens when they are released.</p>
<p>The US president on 19 November signed a bipartisan bill requiring that the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, disclose these documents to the US public within 30 days. Given that other tranches of materials related to the disgraced financier included damning correspondence with high-profile individuals, many expect that still more names of the rich, famous and powerful will be named.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s hate-filled rant ignores facts on immigrant crime and economic benefits</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>In the wake of the deadly Washington DC shooting, Trump claimed immigrants are ‘destroying everything America stands for’. Here’s what the data shows</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy">bolster the US economy</a> and commit crimes at far <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more">lower rates</a> than people born in the US.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516">a broad and vicious invective</a>, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.</p>

      <p>Some small business owners doubt that even strong holiday sales will ease impact of tough year plagued by uncertainty</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s tariffs have increased prices on an array of popular holiday goods and driven a “massive” number of small firms out of business, industry leaders have warned.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/organization/observances/small-business-saturday">Small Business Saturday</a>, firms have their fingers crossed that strong holiday sales will ease the impact of a tough year. But many aren’t holding their breath.</p>

      <p>Next nominee faces enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump</p>
<p>Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term. Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.</p>
<p>The next Republican nominee faces the potentially enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump into a post-Trump era. Here’s a look at the Republicans best positioned for a White House run.</p>

      <p>Shaped by lockdown and two Trump presidencies, gen Z are grappling with a lot in love, dating and the bedroom</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">The sex lives of gen Z</a> are of great interest – to politicians, to parents, to influencers and dating app executives and to you, apparently. Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?</p>
<p>Gen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teens <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf">reported</a> first seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new pipeline agreement. Several B.C. chiefs say their 'answer is still no,' and vow to use 'every tool in our toolbox' to stop the project. We speak with Riley Yesno, a University of Toronto lecturer and Indigenous rights activist, about the reaction from Indigenous communities and what the deal could mean for negotiations going forward.</p>

We'll preview this weekend's retail extravaganza. Also, Social Security benefits can act as a financial buoy for the children and spouses of deceased individuals.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has struck a deal for a 700-mile pipeline carrying 1 million barrels of oil a day to Canada's West Coast in an attempt to pivot away from reliance on the U.S. economy. The project is likely to face multiple legal challenges, however. Plus, Kenyan farmers have won a case over food sovereignty and a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; is suspected of covertly generating billions for Moscow.</p>

<p><strong>What do we know about the other guard member?</strong> Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.</p>
<p><strong>What does Trump mean by</strong> <strong>‘third world</strong> <strong>’?</strong> He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>What has Warren said about Staley?</strong> She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>The Coachella valley typically brings a few things to mind: hot desert sun, the most Instagrammable music festival in the country, and even more sun. What it doesn’t bring to mind, however, is the family-friendly, Mickey Mouse-eared nostalgia associated with all things Disney. But that may be changing.</p>
<p>In 2022, Disney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/disney-california-storyliving-community-rancho-mirage">announced plans to build a first-of-its-kind branded residential community</a>, which they have named “Storyliving by Disney”. The first of the Storyliving communities, Cotino, is officially welcoming residents into model homes in Rancho Mirage, a city nestled in Coachella valley. When all plans are finished, the 618-acre community will feature almost 2,000 residential units, including single-family homes and condos.</p>

<p>That is the question posed by Oh, Mary!, the smash-hit show that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/11/oh-mary-review-cole-escola-broadway">reimagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a gloriously unhinged alcoholic</a> who despises her closeted husband.</p>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Ex-member of the hip-hop group was convicted of money laundering and campaign finance violations after funneling money from a rich Malaysian</p>
<p>From the moment the Fugees shot to fame in the mid-90s, Prakazrel “Pras” Michél was discounted as an incidental member of the hip-hop superstars. He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.</p>
<p>“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.</p>

      <h1>AI's role in improving accessibility</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Accessibility has long been aided by the advancement of technology. When it comes to artificial intelligence, accessibility is top of mind for Taylor Arndt, Chief Operations Officer at Techopolis Online Solutions. Arndt has been blind since birth, and so accessibility has been a lifelong battle. When she was in school, she often received physical materials she was unable to read. So, she bought her own hand-held scanner and downloaded a screen reader. At 14, Arndt taught herself to code. Now as a coder working on AI, Arndt says in order for it to help others, the AI models need to be trained on data that has already incorporated accessibility measures.</p>

      <h1>From value-adds to networking superconductor: how the weird language of tech dulled sport | Aaron Timms</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Tech investors promise to disrupt everything from padel to basketball, but their pitch-deck jargon is slowly draining the humanity from sport itself</p>
<p>Finally, a sector more ludicrously hyped than AI. Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnett <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/project-bs-ambitious-plans-to-reshape-womens-basketball--and-mens-too-154515719.html?guccounter=1">declared</a> that “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/">was the most watched ever</a>. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69250fa1&amp;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D">accounted for</a> half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/">to have been removed</a> from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.</p>

      <h1>‘A step-change’: tech firms battle for undersea dominance with submarine drones</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>As navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead market</p>
<p>Flying drones used during the Ukraine war have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart">changed land battle tactics</a> for ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.</p>
<p>Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/ghost-shark-submarine-drone-australian-navy-explainer">on “Ghost Shark” submarines</a> to counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.</p>

      <h1>Small changes to ‘for you’ feed on X can rapidly increase political polarisation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>Study finds that a week of political content can bring about a shift in views that previously would have taken three years</p>
<p>Small changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.</p>

      <h1>Washington DC national guard shooting: what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe</p>
<p>Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.</p>
<p>The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">hospitalized in critical condition</a>.</p>
<p>The suspect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">Rahmanullah Lakanwal</a>, 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard">national guard members</a> die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.</p>
<p>His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.</p>
<p>He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.</p>
<p>He is believed to have acted alone.</p>
<p>Lakanwal worked with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">CIA in Afghanistan</a>, and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>US citizenship and immigration services also <a href="https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163">said</a> it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.</p>

      <p>It's been almost three years since ChatGPT went live to the world, and it quickly became a helper or shortcut for students. (Ora tool to cheat.) Like it or not, artificial intelligence is with us. Today, we hear the story of one educator who's trying to prepare her students to use AI responsibly. Plus, professional soccer in Britain has long attracted foreign investment — increasingly from folks Stateside. We'll learn how Americans' involvement is shaping the game.</p>

<p>'The prices at which you’re allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes,' U.K. musician and breakout star Olivia Dean said of Ticketmaster on Instagram last week. Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation said they’ll limit the ability to resell tickets above face value going forward, and will refund fans the difference.</p>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>Maher Tarabishi was arrested at a routine visit despite decades in the US, leaving his son with Pompe disease</p>
<p>A 62-year-old father named Maher Tarabishi visited the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a> field office in Dallas, Texas, on 28 October as he has done each year for 17 years. Tarabishi, originally from Jordan, is in the US on a supervision order. Even though his asylum claim was denied, the US government allowed him to remain in the country because he is the primary caretaker for his son, Wael, who was diagnosed at four years old with a progressive muscle disorder called Pompe disease.</p>
<p>Tarabishi’s mandatory annual visits to ICE were never eventful; he’d arrive, an official might ask about Wael’s condition, and then he would leave. This time was different.</p>

      <h1>Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USA</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A few years ago James Cook worked in a Surrey cinema and Max Pircher played in Austria. Now they’re in the NFL</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p>
<p>The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.</p>
<p>Cook has been in charge of player development at Cleveland Browns for the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe. He got as far as playing for Great Britain but his plans to go to college in the US proved financially prohibitive.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have jointly agreed on a path forward for a new bitumen pipeline to the B.C. coast — a hugely significant development that the federal government is framing as a chance to further develop Alberta's energy sector, diversify Canada's economy and lessen dependence on the U.S.</p>

      <h1>The Super Bowl Shuffle at 40: how a goofy rap classic boosted the Bears’ title run</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A new documentary charts how a song that featured a 335lb rapper and bad dancing went viral in the pre-internet era</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears are 8-3 and soaring in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings">this season’s NFL standings</a>. For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.</p>
<p>Before the 1985 edition of the Bears romped to victory in Super Bowl XX, they tempted fate by recording The Super Bowl Shuffle. Although the song only peaked at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooT_uz--O2A&amp;t=3s">the accompanying video</a> came to rival Michael Jackson’s Thriller for popularity as it popped up endlessly on TV during the Bears’ title run. “The Super Bowl Shuffle went viral in an age where there was no viral existence like we know it today,” the song’s recording engineer, Fred Breitberg, says. “It was a phenomenal entity as well as being a good record.”</p>

<p>The new map takes aim at North Carolina’s only swing seat, currently held by Democrat Don Davis, an African American who represents more than 20 counties in the state’s north-east. The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s ICE raids across southern California have had disastrous effects on the region’s immigrants and swept up US citizens in the process, community leaders and residents said at a congressional hearing in Los Angeles on Monday.</p>

She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/us-citizens-jailed-ice-los-angeles">her attorney described</a> as a lack of evidence.</p>

      <h1>‘Traitor’: US representatives call for Trump envoy Witkoff to be fired after leaked Kremlin call</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats warn Witkoff ‘cannot be trusted’ after reportedly advising officials on peace plan</p>
<p>A handful of US representatives have reacted furiously to a leaked recording in which the special envoy to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">coached</a> Moscow on how to handle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, but most have so far remained mute on the revelation that American officials were advising a US adversary.</p>
<p>Don Bacon, a Republican representative, called for Steve Witkoff’s immediate dismissal. “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign &amp; democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians,” the Nebraska lawmaker <a href="https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/1993446393076498714?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

      <p>Justice department maintains that Trump administration didn’t violate judge’s order to return flights to US</p>
<p>The Department of Justice said in a statement that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was the one who made the decision to continue with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">deportation flights</a> of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador in March, despite a federal judge’s directive that the flights must be returned to the United States.</p>

      <p>New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that earning a college degree can still help you keep a job and get higher wages, but it’s less of an advantage than it used to be. ​The unemployment gap between college graduates and those with just a high school diploma is narrowing. Also: a handful of stocks driving economic growth, a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, and life as a 67-year-old retiree.</p>

      <p>Katie Wilson’s rise from transit campaigner to city hall shows how trust, volunteers and years of organizing overcame big-money politics</p>
<p>While a blue wave was sweeping key races in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City, Virginia, and New Jersey on 4 November, Seattle progressives were biting their nails down to a quick. At 8pm, only the first round of ballots had been counted in Seattle, and Katie Wilson, a longtime community organizer and the progressive challenger in the mayoral race, was behind by seven points.</p>
<p>But it was far from over. Because Washington tate votes almost entirely by mail, that first ballot count was less than a quarter of the vote. As the week wore on, and progressives’ fingernails disappeared, Wilson’s share of the vote crept up, slowly but steadily. Eight days after the election, Seattle declared that Wilson would be the next mayor of Seattle.</p>

<p>Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-advised-russia-on-how-to-pitch-ukraine-plan-to-trump">scoop</a> showing how Trump aide Steve Witkoff coached the Kremlin on the best way to get into Trump’s good graces is extraordinary for what it tells us about Witkoff’s dubious loyalties and the Kremlin’s potential influence over US negotiation efforts. But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">story covers two intercepted phone calls</a>: one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/21/who-is-kirill-dmitriev-draft-plan-ukraine-war-russia">who has been deeply involved in negotiations</a> with the Trump White House.</p>

<p>Stranger Things fans will finally get some answers when Season 5 drops today — but that's not stopping them from speculating about who might die or how the show’s villains might be defeated. They say whether they’re right or wrong, it's fun to predict how the beloved series will come to a close.</p>

      <p>Witkoff also offered tactical guidance on how Putin should raise subject with Trump, audio recording suggests. Plus, the female pilots on Ukraine’s frontline</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk</a> and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>What did Witkoff say?</strong> “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?</strong> It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.</p>
<p><strong>What have the White House said?</strong> A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.</p>

      <h1>Rightwing influencers spin anti-Muslim rage in Michigan for social media reach</h1>

      <p>In Dearborn, provocateurs have held anti-Islam rallies, attempted to burn the Qur’an and rile residents for clickbait</p>
<p>White nationalist and rightwing agitators recently descended on Dearborn, Michigan, to hold an anti-Islam rally at which they attempted to burn a Qur’an and manufacture controversy over the city’s large Arab-American population. But the protest has been dismissed by local leaders as a cheap publicity stunt aimed at generating money and clicks for far-right influencers.</p>
<p>But there is little doubt the Michigan city has become a repeated target for the publicity-hungry far-right because it holds the US’s highest percentage of Arab-American residents. Similar provocateurs have <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/03/03/christian-evangelists-free-speech-dearborn-court-case/24347331/">marched with a pig’s head</a> on a pole at an Arab-American fair.

<p>This time last season, Liverpool had just registered their 10th win in 12 games to go nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. It was around this time the narrative around Slot’s team shifted from questioning if they could win the title in their first season post-Jürgen Klopp to predicting just how far ahead of the chasing pack they would finish. A year on, the narrative has shifted tremendously.</p>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews. It comes a day after the Pentagon announced it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters Tuesday that Trump “is attempting to use the FBI to scare us.” The inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes.</p>

<p>US district judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, certified a nationwide class of individuals who were already living in the United States when they were detained and are legally entitled to a hearing to determine whether they can be released on bond while their deportation cases proceed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is framing its boat strikes against drug cartels in the Caribbean in part as a collective self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region, according to three people directly familiar with the administration’s internal legal argument.</p>
<p>The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.</p>

      <p>“Affordability” — it’s a hot-button issue across the political spectrum. But how does one define or quantify a subjective idea? We called up a linguist and a few economists to hear their thoughts. Plus: Flat wholesale inflation is a warning sign for higher overall inflation, September retail sales merely inched up, and the U.S. dollar is showing signs of recovery after a troubling first half of the year.</p>

      <p>The US president made jokes at the annual turkey pardoning ceremony. It went as well as you would expect</p>
<p>Don’t give up the day job. On Tuesday, Donald Trump came to the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?thanksgiving">annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning</a> ceremony at the White House ready to serve up some political satire. It went about as well as you would expect.</p>
<p>Like a startled turkey flapping in zigzags, the US president’s speech ricocheted bafflingly from topic to topic. He told jokes in the worst possible taste and watched them arc through the Rose Garden sky before landing with a thud. And on a day intended for charity and good cheer, he described a state governor as “a big, fat slob”.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Wayne county circuit court in Michigan by Robert Garza, who had joined Campbell’s New Jersey headquarters remotely in September 2024 as a security analyst. Garza alleges he was fired in January after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-president of information technology – including referring to one of the company’s ingredients as “bioengineered meat” while going off on a racist tirade.</p>

<p>The fight, which saw a white woman punched in the face from behind by an African American man, among other incidents, took place when around 150,000 people were attending events in the city’s urban core.</p>

<p>San Francisco receiver Jauan Jennings said he threw a punch at Tre’Von Moehrig at the end of Monday night’s game after a “cheap shot” from the Carolina safety.</p>
<p>Television cameras caught Moehrig <a href="https://x.com/Jordan_Woodson/status/1993169475777282291">delivering a punch to Jennings’ groin</a> late in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/24/49ers-panthers-monday-night-football">49ers’ 20-9 victory</a>. Jennings did not immediately retaliate but once the game was over he approached Moehrig and hit him in the helmet before giving him a shove. Jennings then needed to be held back as the teams left the field.</p>

      <h1>US judge throws out criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>Judge says interim US attorney for eastern district of Virginia had ‘no lawful authority’ to indict former FBI director and New York attorney general. Plus, where did all the color go from the movies?</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed">threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James</a> yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.</p>
<p><strong>What did the judge say?</strong> “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>When did the talks begin?</strong> Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.</p>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, are being sued by victims and family members of victims in the October 2023 attack in Israel. They're accusing Binance of knowingly enabling terrorist groups like Hamas to move more than $1 billion through its platform. Also: a slowdown at Serbia's Russian-owned oil refinery, growing risks to European undersea cables, and rerouted flights after an Ethiopian volcano eruption.</p>

<p>More than three dozen universities including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Duke have their participation in a federal research partnership on the chopping block after the state department proposed to suspend them over their diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices.</p>
<p>Last week, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/universities-state-department-dei-research-program">obtained an internal memo and spreadsheet</a> showing that the state department is moving to exclude 38 institutions from the Diplomacy Lab program, which pairs university researchers with state department policy offices on foreign policy projects. The suspensions would take effect on 1 January, and because the list is not finalized, the school’s have not yet been informed.</p>

<p>More than two decades ago, the US railed against the “axis of evil”. Now, after international climate talks spluttered to a meagre conclusion, the US finds itself grouped with unflattering company – an “axis of obstruction” that has stymied progress on the climate crisis.</p>

      <p>Research shows 70% disapprove of job US president – who won backing of nearly half of Latino voters in 2024 – is doing</p>
<p>A majority of Latinos disapprove of Donald Trump and his economic and immigration policies, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/11/24/majorities-of-latinos-disapprove-of-trump-and-his-policies-on-immigration-economy/?_gl=1%2A1k4pmdf%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_gs%2AMQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoZDJBhC0ARIsAERP-F9FVusKoTUXKNwsxVF7Op3CIaTC4F9gik34xgBC5D8Ni1_jfG2Q98caArkIEALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA_c1WRm0AZFiMW3uClUkzhkA_FxF0">a new report</a> from the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>After receiving support from nearly half of Latino voters in the 2024 election, Trump had lost the backing of a majority surveyed in October.

      <p>
      <p>Former Republican congressman and presidential candidate voices support for six Democrats, saying ‘our illegal process of going into war needs to be addressed’</p>
<p>The president was online early today, and fired off a Truth Social post at 5:38am touting the economic impact that his sweeping tariffs will soon have on the country. He also noted that countries’ efforts to stockpile US goods ahead of the levies kicking in was “wearing thin”.</p>
<p>“These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course,” he wrote. “This Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before.”</p>
<p>Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us. I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter,” he added.</p>

      <h1>Are more Americans working multiple jobs?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>The delayed-by-the-shutdown September jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected monthly gain of 119,000 jobs, seasonally adjusted. But dig into the data, and signs point to many of those jobs being second or third jobs. In this episode, more people are working multiple gigs to get by. Plus: China’s got a different AI investment approach than the U.S., the housing market got a boost in October, and your online return probably ended up on the secondary market.</p>

      <p>President’s comment implies hostility to Venezuela may be based on unfounded election-rigging conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to endorse the discredited conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s leadership controls electronic voting software worldwide and caused his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>White House officials have previously said that Trump’s increasingly bellicose policy toward Venezuela is driven by concerns about migration and the drug trade. But the president’s new comment, made on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115600167812342707">Truth Social</a>, hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.</p>

<p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> are searching for the body of a man who was swept into the ocean at a beach in the Big Sur area, one week after a girl and her father died after being pulled into the water in the same state park.</p>
<p>Three people were pulled into the water from the rocks at the Soberanes Point area of Garrapata state park on Saturday afternoon just after 3pm and began yelling for help, according to a statement from the Monterey county sheriff’s office. Two women who had been dragged into the ocean were able to pull themselves out of the water.</p>

      <p>The U.S. economy is often buoyed by consumer spending. In China, however, consumer spending is a much smaller part of economic output. And while the government there tries to stimulate spending, young people there are grappling with high unemployment and stalling wage growth. Plus, we'll discuss expectations for inflation and economic growth, as well as consumer shopping figures for this upcoming Black Friday.</p>

<p>So it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all.</p>
<p>It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.</p>

      <p>Police had issued alert after Morgan Geyser cut off monitoring bracelet, and was reportedly located at a truck stop</p>
<p>The Wisconsin woman who admitted to repeatedly stabbing a sixth-grade classmate to delight the fictional online horror character Slender Man in 2014 has been caught after authorities said she cut off a monitoring bracelet and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/wisconsin-woman-missing-slender-man-stabbing">left her group home</a>.</p>
<p>Morgan Geyser, 23, was found in Posen, Illinois, on Sunday evening, authorities said. Police in Madison, Wisconsin, had issued an alert for Geyser earlier in the day, saying she had last been seen with an adult acquaintance on Saturday evening.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Americans don’t often have a direct say in how their tax dollars get spent; those decisions are generally left to elected officials. But some places have engaged in “participatory budgeting,” where residents propose projects, then vote on which ones get public funding. Today, we head to Nashville to learn how the process played out. But first: economics at the center of G20 discussions and what Thanksgiving travel plans are looking like.</p>

      <h1>How did McLaren get it so wrong with their cars in Las Vegas? | Giles Richards</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season</p>
<p>As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second">to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri</a> from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.</p>
<p>Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.</p>
<p><strong>What did Kelly say?</strong> “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.</p>
<p><strong>What does the original plan say?</strong> The original <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy">28-point US document</a> leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.</p>
<p>Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources. By contrast, the department last year employed about 10,000 attorneys, according to DoJ data.</p>

      <h1>Doctors respond to ‘data-free’ decision over menopause hormone therapy: ‘It’s not true’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits</p>
<p>Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.</p>
<p>The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.</p>

      <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their contacts</p>
<p>Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine, <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/who-we-are/">describes</a> its financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.</p>
<p>It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent graduates themselves.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.</p>
<p>The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.</p>
<p>They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &quot;prolific debutantes&quot; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.</p>
<p>Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The most successful quarterback of all-time approached his playing career with ruthless focus. He could do with the same intensity in his retirement projects</p>
<p>Tom Brady played for 23 NFL seasons with a single, maniacal goal: to become the greatest quarterback who ever lived. He achieved it. Now, in retirement, Brady has dabbled in everything. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/18/tom-bradys-raiders-coaching-booth-fox">calls games for Fox</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/20/birmingham-city-unveil-62000-capacity-stadium-plans-12-chimney-towers">building chimneys in Birmingham</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/27/where-did-ftx-money-go">flogged crypto</a>. He’s spreading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics">America’s Game to Riyadh</a>. He has a thriving YouTube account. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/04/tom-brady-dog-clone-colossal-biotech-viagen">cloned his dog</a>. Brady’s post-playing portfolio has been diverse, or aimless, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Side hustles are one thing. But running a pro franchise is not a part-time job. Along with his other roles, Brady is also the de facto football czar of the Raiders, the most hapless team in the league.</p>

<p>When an Ontario woman made a $4,300 hotel reservation on Booking.com, she never expected the website would cancel it, then offer her the same accommodations for quadruple the price. A digital rights lawyer says such cases show how weak consumer protections allow online platforms to shift risk and costs onto travellers.</p>

<p>At a press conference last week U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out fresh allegations against Ryan Wedding, a 44-year-old Canadian and former Olympian who has been on the FBI’s most wanted list since March.
Wedding is already accused of orchestrating multiple murders, and these new charges add to the drug and conspiracy allegations he’s facing.
We speak to Calvi Leon, a reporter at the Toronto Star who’s been covering this case extensively.

<p>Democratic senator Mark Kelly has said he refuses to be intimidated after US president Donald Trump accused a group of Democrats of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">“seditious behaviour punishable by death”</a> in a series of social media posts.</p>
<p>Kelly, one of several Democrats who released a message to military and intelligence personnel that they are not obligated to follow “illegal orders”, reiterated his call on Sunday, saying that Trump was “trying to intimidate us”.

<p>The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”.</p>

<p>Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.</p>

      <h1>They’re doing to America what they did to Christianity | Bill McKibben</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to America has a precedent: the Maga evangelical perversion of Jesus’s message of radical love to one of hate and aggression</p>
<p>Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings">AI video</a> of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.</p>
<p>He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">current estimate</a> of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-climate-rollbacks-heat-deaths">study</a> predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors">active collaboration</a> of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”</p>

      <h1>‘Eating Indigenously’: award-winning chef celebrates Native American cuisine in new cookbook</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>James Beard-winning chef Sean Sherman’s cookbook Turtle Island pushes readers to view food systems through an Indigenous lens</p>
<p>As a child growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the 1970s and 80s, Sean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota member and a James Beard award-winning chef, recalls pounding dried bison and mixing it with chokeberry to create a snack called wasná. He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Thíŋpsiŋla, a wild prairie turnip that’s a staple Lakota food. Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.</p>
<p>His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant <a href="https://owamni.com/">Owamni</a>, shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.</p>

      <p>The costs of groceries, housing, childcare, education and healthcare have become intolerable to many</p>

Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”</p>

<p>One morning in October, Donna DesRuisseaux headed to a local bridge near her home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, armed with a sign that said: “Honk for democracy.” The 62-year-old business manager was taking part in a new tradition of protesting on various bridges and overpasses throughout the state.</p>
<p>“I’m very worried about our democracy, freedom of speech, social security and health insurance,” said DesRuisseaux, who attended a No Kings protest in Manchester, New Hampshire, later that day, where she ran into some of her “bridge friends”. DesRuisseaux had never protested anything prior to 2025, in part because she was a busy working mom. But after discovering the <a href="https://www.nhbbd.org">NH Bridge Brigade for Democracy</a> group on Facebook, she knew she had to do something to express her outrage.</p>

      <h1>China has brought millions out of poverty. The US has not – by choice</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system</p>
<p>The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than <span class="math inline">\(3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than \)</span>3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.</p>
<p>The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.</p>

<p>As Canada starts to diversify its ties with other countries amidst an increasingly unpredictable and unreliable relationship with the U.S., its pivot toward China, in particular, will need to be strategic: the work must be done while balancing the risks and strengthening the country internally.</p>

<p>And yet, for the past several years, almost nothing has gone right for a beach resort known and envied in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> area for its beauty, its excellent public schools, and a progressive political culture that has sought to keep the city accessible and affordable to people of all income levels.</p>

<p>The US hemp industry is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/hemp-republican-spending-bill">preparing for a ban</a> on most hemp products that Senator Mitch McConnell slipped into the spending bill just before the Senate voted to pass it and end the government shutdown.</p>
<p>Many in the industry have criticized the last-minute change, arguing that it should have been subject to open hearings rather than added at the last minute to a bill whose passage was essential for the government reopening. The ban, which goes into effect 12 months after the law’s passage, forbids all products that contain more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per package – a trace amount that is present in most CBD products, not just those whose primary component is THC.</p>

      <h1>Trump to end temporary protected status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>Move could affect hundreds of Somalis who fled civil war in their home country</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Friday night that he’s “immediately” terminating temporary legal protections for Somali migrants living in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesota</a>, further targeting a program seeking to limit deportations that his administration has already repeatedly sought to weaken.</p>
<p>Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in the east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.</p>

      <p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants. We visit a refugee farmer in Houston, a chocolate-making lab in California, and stop for a bite at an award-winning restaurant in Portland.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A year and a half after his unstoppable rise was hijacked, the 26-year-old boxing star aims to become a three-weight champion against big-punching Brian Norman Jr</p>
<p>Rain falls in thin, needling lines over Hell’s Kitchen as Devin Haney walks into the Victory Boxing Gym. Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.</p>
<p>“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”</p>

      <p>The philosopher and the sex trafficker were in contact long after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, documents reveal</p>
<p>The prominent linguist and philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.</p>
<p>Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president">had previously claimed</a> to have with the latter.</p>

      <p>A pension-pot World Cup looms and with Trump in the White House and a crown prince at his back, it is now a safe space</p>
<p>It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi">state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman</a> and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.</p>
<p>Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.</p>

<p>The British driver’s march to the title looks increasingly likely with pole at what has been a bogey circuit for McLaren.</p>
<p>Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.</p>

<p>Much of the magic Pixar once commanded seems to have dissipated. And while their original films, from Elemental to Elio, struggle in the box office, films from countries and studios less well-heeled in the world of animation have somewhat usurped their throne.  Can they ever get back on top?</p>

      <p>
      <p>TJX, the parent company of off-price retailers T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, posted excellent earnings this week, while Target cut its sales forecast. “Off-price” means TJX sells excess inventory at a discount, which may be more attractive to increasingly stressed shoppers hunting for deals. Also in this episode: Political affiliation colors consumer sentiment, USDA cuts end a major revenue stream for small-scale farmers, and supply chains are unusually slow this holiday season.</p>

      <h1>‘I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>The president hosted the mayor-elect at the White House – and seemed enamoured of his fellow New Yorker</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Oval Office meeting between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> – the mayor-elect of New York City, the US president’s beloved home town – was hardly the combustible tête-à-tête many had predicted. For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together.</p>
<p>Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “ <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157">100% Communist Lunatic</a>” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In turn, Mamdani had assailed Trump as a “despot” and pledged to be the president’s “ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trumps-worst-nightmare-mamdani-targets-the-president-in-his-general-election-bid-00504123">worst nightmare</a>”.

He continued: “I’m not going to get into my specific security arrangements, but it would be irresponsible for me not to consider that [Trump’s] words result in increased threats to myself, even to my staff, to my family.</p>

<p>Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367">10 million people to lose their health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. But it will do so in part by paring back eligibility forMedicaid, the US government’s health insurance program for low-income people; raising the cost of healthcare under the Affordable Care Act; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/planned-parenthood-medicaid-trump">defunding some family planning providers</a> who offer abortions.</p>

      <h1>New Mexico now offers free childcare for all. Here’s how parents and teachers made it happen</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>From marches and petitions to a constitutional amendment, a years-long campaign led to New Mexico becoming the first state in the US to offer universal childcare</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/people-in-the-us-have-you-gotten-involved-in-community-organizing-this-year">People in the US: Have you gotten involved in activism or community organizing this year?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay. Although she taught, cooked, cleaned and did the books for a small childcare center, she was earning minimum wage. A classmate at the local community college had suggested Ibarra attend the rally, and stick around afterward for a meal with Olé, a grassroots non-profit committed to organizing working-class families.</p>

      <h1>The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1</p>
<p>The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.</p>

<p>The FBI, the documents show, gained access to conversations in a “courtwatch” Signal group that helps coordinate volunteer activists who monitor public proceedings at three New York federal immigration courts.

      <p>Experts say files certain to contain revelations but warn disclosures could still leave critical questions unanswered</p>
<p>They are the files that America – and the world – has long waited to see: a huge cache of documents at the Department of Justice related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/judge-calls-jeffrey-epstein-most-infamous-pedophile-in-american-history-as-he-releases-transcripts/">whom a judge</a> once dubbed the “most infamous pedophile in American history”.</p>
<p>After a law passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday, those documents must now must be released to the American public and a waiting army of journalists. Just like previous Epstein caches they are certain to include damning communications between Epstein and many rich and powerful people in his social circle.</p>

<p>Two of three Sikh separatists arrested for firearms offences have had all charges against them dropped. The third, Inderjit Singh Gosal, replaced Hardeep Singh Nijjar as leader of the Sikh independence referendum campaign in Canada following Nijjar's 2023 assassination.</p>

      <p>Italian MEP ‘disgusted’ after US president received $130,000 engraved gold bar weeks before he decided to slash tariffs on Swiss imports</p>
<p>A gold Rolex desk clock and a $130,000 engraved gold bar given to Donald Trump by a group of Swiss billionaires have raised questions in Europe and the US about the personalisation of US presidential power.</p>
<p>Pasquale Tridico, an Italian MEP and the former head of the country’s national institute for social security said he was “disgusted” by the golden charm offensive, made weeks before Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/tariffs-swiss-goods-reduced">decided to slash 39% tariffs on Swiss imports</a> to 15%.</p>

      <h1>Digested week: Trump’s weird ‘piggy’ jibe expands his cutesy-sinister lexicon</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Plus Vanity Fair’s plucky decision to feature only men in its Hollywood Issue and the reporter fired after RFK Jr ‘sexting scandal’</p>
<p>We’ve all said things that didn’t come out right, and it’s my instinct – stand by for some counter-intuition! – that Donald Trump’s “quiet, piggy” admonishment of a female reporter on Air Force One this week was a very weird attempt at affection, or possibly flirtation. As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">expressed outrage</a> after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.</p>
<p><strong>What did the lawmakers say in the video?</strong> “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”</p>
<p><strong>What did the report say?</strong> A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.</p>
<p><strong>Where did it come from?</strong> The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/">Property of the People</a>, a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.</p>

      <p>After months of ICE raids on the nation’s capital, some construction workers are afraid to go into Washington, D.C. for work, fearing arrest and deportation. Meanwhile, the contractors who need them are struggling to adapt. We'll check in on some of the businesses that are being most affected. But first: why markets ended yesterday on a sour note, and why the housing affordability crisis is accelerating fastest in rural areas.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan's cabinet has approved a stimulus package worth more than $130 billion. It's the first major policy initiative of the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and aims to help households and companies with measures like energy subsidies and tax cuts. Then, the global climate change conference COP30 is drawing to a close in Brazil, and so far, there’s been no agreement on key issues like the fossil fuel phaseout.</p>

<p>The embattled former police chief of Vallejo, a San Francisco Bay Area city that has attracted <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/23/how-a-deadly-police-force-ruled-a-city">national attention</a> over police violence, has said that he endured a steady procession of racist remarks from colleagues and online harassment and threats that ultimately led him to resign.</p>
<p>By the time Chief Shawny Williams tendered his resignation in 2022, he said he had received a slew of threats – at his office, at his home, and in his email inbox. Most demanded he step down. But even after resigning, the threats still came by mail to his home and a second property he owned outside the state.</p>

<p>Jonathan Toews – the former Chicago Blackhawks captain who led the club to three Stanley Cups in six seasons – was not only making his debut for his hometown Winnipeg Jets. He was playing his first NHL game in two and a half years.</p>

      <p>The sport is rooted in the culture of rugged individualism and has been slow to adopt modern techniques. That state of affairs is slowly changing</p>
<p>Boosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence. Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>But while rodeo is booming, athlete development remains antiquated.</p>

<p>Little went right for Josh Allen in a frustrating game Thursday night against the Houston Texans. And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.</p>
<p>Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.</p>

You knew it for sure when James Carville, Anthony Fauci and <a href="https://x.com/peterbakernyt/status/1991529149379539207?s=20">Rachel Maddow</a> were seen sitting close to one another in the nave.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/dick-cheney-funeral-trump-vance">The funeral</a> of the 46th US vice-president, Dick Cheney, who died earlier this month aged 84, was a throwback to a less raucous and rancorous time. Ex-presidents and vice-presidents, Democratic and Republican, made small talk, but Donald Trump, who spent Thursday crying treason and calling for Democrats to be put to death, and his deputy JD Vance were not invited.</p>

<p>Wall Street initially rose after Nvidia, the world’s largest public company, reassured investors of strong demand for its advanced datacenter chips. But the relief dissipated, and technology stocks at the heart of the AI boom came under pressure.</p>

      <p>Big-name drivers and cutting out the middle man a vital part of the strategy with just over 100 days to go before the 2026 season opener</p>
<p>Twelve months ago at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Cadillac were finally given the green light as Formula One’s newest entry for 2026. Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.</p>
<p>At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.</p>

<p>Several men accused Spacey of making unwanted sexual advances during the #MeToo movement. In an interview with The Telegraph, Spacey said the financial hardship that followed has left him without a permanent home. While none of the allegations were proven in court, Spacey says the allegations have kept Hollywood at bay.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Gracie Hunt, the daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, is throwing her support behind Turning Point USA’s plan to stage an alternative Super Bowl half-time show, a direct counter to the NFL’s decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/bad-bunny-to-headline-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show">to feature Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LX</a>.</p>
<p>Hunt said in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s The Will Cain Show on Tuesday that she “most definitely” backs Turning Point’s counter-programming effort, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/charlie-erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-tpusa">Erika Kirk</a>, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to his <a href="https://time.com/5852446/bad-bunny-black-lives-matter/">criticism of Donald Trump</a> and US immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>It's certainly not the first time U.S. President Donald Trump has insulted a female reporter, but calling Bloomberg's Catherine Lucey 'piggy' on Air Force One, then berating ABC News' Mary Bruce a few days later has raised questions about just how much journalists are expected to tolerate as they do their jobs.</p>

      <p>After a month and a half delay due to the government shutdown, we are finally getting some official economic data. It is old (from September), but it's here. The economy gained 119,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate went up for the third month in a row. What's that mean for job seekers? Plus, declining consumer sentiment doesn't translate to declining consumer spending, Walmart's quarterly results beat expectations, and international student enrollment has dipped.</p>

      <p>As federal agents descend in North Carolina, businesses close as even an after-school program is targeted</p>
<p>On Central Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, Manolo’s Bakery has become a focal point for resistance to the expanded immigration raids since border patrol officers descended on the city over the weekend. The owner closed the bakery to prevent his staff from being targeted. Most of the other shops on Charlotte’s busy immigrant-centric street followed suit.</p>
<p>Dozens of people have taken up camp in the parking lot to wave signs of support for immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) has been active in the city for months as part of Donald Trump’s mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">deportation agenda</a>, but things went up a level when the border patrol arrived. Agents swiftly began buzzing through the place to make an armed show of their presence, followed at times by Charlotteans honking their horns in warning.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Nvidia reported earnings yesterday after markets closed, and it did not disappoint. Nvidia makes 90% of all chips used in AI. Tech stocks, including Nvidia, have been carrying a lot of weight in markets, and investors had started getting a little nervous about whether the AI boom was a bubble — but Nvidia's results have been pretty reassuring. Also: stale data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Japan's tensions with China.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: US and Russian officials draft plan to end Ukraine war based on capitulation from Kyiv</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>The plan, which is likely to be viewed as ‘surrender’ by Kyiv, is facing pushback from the EU. Plus, Trump signs bill to compel release of more Epstein documents</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine">quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine</a> that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.</p>
<p><strong>Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?</strong> That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.</p>
<p><strong>What has the EU said?</strong> Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15">follow our live blog here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What will the justice department actually release?</strong> All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.</p>

<p>Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.</p>
<p>He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.</p>

      <h1>White nationalist Nick Fuentes is exposing a civil war among US Republicans: ‘We look like clowns’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain</p>
<p>Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.</p>
<p>Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.</p>

      <h1>Will AI bubble fears persist?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Wall Street was cheered last night by better-than-expected results from the chip giant Nvidia. But the AI boom continues to fuel fears of a market bubble. In the past few weeks, a growing number of the world’s leading figures in finance have suggested that AI stocks are unrealistically inflated in value. Plus, Meta says it's shutting down accounts for younger teenagers in Australia ahead of the country's social media ban for youths under 16.</p>

<p>Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367">10 million people to lose their health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.</p>

<p>At the close of quintessential NWSL playoffs rife with last-minute goals and upsets, the eighth-placed underdogs Gotham FC will face second-placed Washington Spirit for the trophy.

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Grokipedia, the AI-powered encyclopedia launched by Elon Musk's xAI last month, promises to be an ideological alternative to Wikipedia. But the tool doesn't just have a different political flavor, argues Ryan McGrady, senior fellow at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>He recently wrote, for Tech Policy Press, that Grokipedia takes a more top-down approach to knowledge, one that harks back to less democratized eras.</p>

<p>“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,” Donald Trump claimed in 2016, “and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Coming two weeks before the Iowa caucus, it was an unusual message from a politician, but the last nine years have served to underscore the point.</p>
<p>His “Make America great again” base, and the bulk of the Republican party, stood with him through (deep breath): two impeachments, children in cages, “very fine people on both sides”, 34 felony convictions, an insurrection, “shithole countries”, attempting to overturn an election, hush money payments to an adult film actor, “they’re rapists”, a brutal immigration crackdown, Four Seasons Total Landscaping, “grab ‘em by the pussy”, billions of dollars made by the Trump family, cosying up to dictators, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-stares-into-the-sun-as-aide-screams-dont-look/#:~:text=Today%20President%20Trump%20stepped%20out,stared%20dumbly%20into%20the%20sun.">“don’t look!”</a>, mass pardons for his allies and friends, an unfinished wall, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-liberation-day-tariff-walk-back">“liberation day”</a>, presenting himself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king">as a king</a>, forcing <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/76/233676-050-34726587/American-businessman-Donald-Trump-Jr-2018.jpg?w=300">Donald Trump Jr</a> into the public consciousness, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/19/trump-emissions-policy-could-cause-climate-deaths">and more</a>.</p>

<p>Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a sort of prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday that archaeologists have mapped the location of 16 canoes submerged in the lake bed of Lake Mendota in Madison. Tamara Thomsen, the state’s maritime archaeologist, said the site lies near a network of what were once Indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.</p>

<p>Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in the government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported.</p>

<p>The intensively discussed files related to the disgraced former financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein passed a significant milestone on Tuesday when Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of releasing them.</p>
<p>After months of deliberate delays and manoeuvres, the House of Representatives voted by 427 to one in favor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, legislation which would, if enacted, require the justice department to release all unclassified materials on Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The Senate has unanimously agreed to swiftly pass the bill, which would then head to the White House for Donald Trump’s signature.</p>

<p>Major League Soccer announced on Wednesday that it is re-opening its investigation into Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner.

      <h1>Why are retailers hiring fewer seasonal workers?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>In a word: uncertainty. Retail chains like Target are pulling back on hiring temporary workers ahead of this year’s holiday shopping season as tariffs take their toll, consumer sentiment slumps, and little government data leaves them with little guidance. We’ll hear more. But first: there’s a lot riding on Nvidia results, and investors are split on predictions for the Fed’s next rate decision.</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>Legislation would next go to Trump who indicated he would sign bill after he and his allies reversed course</p>
<p>The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the morning after a near-unanimous vote in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a>.</p>
<p>By unanimous consent, the Senate agreed to pass the measure as soon as it arrived in the chamber from the House on Tuesday, which had overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier that day in a 427-1 tally. Once the legislation is forwarded to the Senate, it will be automatically approved and cleared for Trump’s signature. The president, who dropped his opposition after it was clear it would pass, has said he would sign it.</p>

      <p>In August, Donald Trump started a campaign of aggression against Venezuela. The US president first launched airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of the South American country – a move largely condemned as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-strikes-against-boats-in-caribbean-disregard-international-law-french-minister-says">extrajudicial killings</a> – then deployed US naval assets in the Caribbean. The Guardian's Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, explains why the claims the targeted boats were carrying drugs destined for the US are dubious and what Trump's actions could mean for the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>Some 24 million people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. But subsidies and tax credits that have made these plans more affordable for the past few years are expiring, and the cost of health insurance is likely going to double, on average, for those losing subsidies. How do you plan for that? Plus, a Cloudflare outage took down sites yesterday, and tensions between China and Japan escalated.</p>

<p>Pope Leo has reiterated his disapproval of Donald Trump’s immigration policies, saying foreigners in the US are being treated in an “extremely disrespectful way”.</p>
<p>Leo, the first US pontiff in the history of the Catholic church, made the remarks in response to questions about a statement adopted last week during a special assembly of US bishops that criticised the Trump administration’s mass deportations and lamented the fear and anxiety caused by immigration raids.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The chief executive of the South Korean firm Hyundai said that the White House phoned him personally to apologize for an immigration raid at a massive battery factory in Georgia in September. More than 300 South Korean workers were detained and later sent back to South Korea, stoking tensions between the two nations. Plus, China has imposed a ban on all imports of Japanese seafood amid a growing dispute between Asia's two biggest economies</p>

<p>An owl found partially encased in concrete after it got inside a cement mixer in south-western Utah is expected to fly free again after it was painstakingly cleaned by animal sanctuary workers who described the bird as a “fighter”.</p>
<p>The great horned owl was found at the Black Desert Resort in the south-western part of the state and arrived at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, earlier this month with its face, chest and right wing covered in dried concrete. After making sure the bird could breathe, sanctuary workers spent days cracking apart the concrete using forceps and cleaning its feathers using toothbrushes, dish soap and their fingers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Senate moved swiftly yesterday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">to approve legislation</a> that would force the release of investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, hours after a near-unanimous vote in the House, almost wrapping up a bipartisan effort Donald Trump had fought for months.</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> The Epstein case returned dramatically to the public eye in July, when the justice department and FBI <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms">released a memo</a> saying they had nothing further to disclose about the investigation. That contradicted statements that the administration would release more information about Epstein in office.</p>
<p><strong>Why has Trump been unable to escape this</strong> <strong>case?</strong> The Epstein scandal is a core issue for a swathe of Trump’s rightwing base, some of whom believe in conspiracy theories that surround Epstein and his coterie of powerful friends. Unlike many other issues, the Epstein files have prompted rebellions from Trump’s supporters.</p>

      <p>China recently came out with its latest five-year plan for growth, which will guide the world’s second largest economy through 2030. In it, top Communist Party leaders have pushed to boost the country's strength in manufacturing to the next level by upgrading older factories with advanced technologies for automation.</p>
<p>The challenge, according to the Chinese ministry of education, is that the sector has tens of millions of open jobs because there aren't enough skilled workers in the labor force to fill them.</p>
<p>One school is trying to bridge that gap. Marketplace China correspondent Jennifer Pak visited it in Nanjing city.</p>

<p>A report from Canada’s victims of crime advocate says survivors of sexual violence are being systemically betrayed by the criminal justice system, as allegations are disbelieved and cases are regularly delayed or dropped.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old turned himself in to Hamilton police and has been charged in the July death of Belinda Sarkodie, 26, who was shot while waiting for a bus, police announced Wednesday. Those close to Sarkodie hope for justice but wonder why it took four months for an arrest.</p>

      <p>We now know 42 of the 48 of the teams that will play next year, but for a host of teams the race goes on via playoffs</p>
<p>All nine of the automatic places have been filled by the nine group winners, with the four best runners-up – DR Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Nigeria – competing in November’s playoffs in Morocco. Nigeria beat Gabon 4-1 in the first semi-final, while Cameroon fell to a last-gasp 1-0 defeat by DR Congo in the second tie. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">DR Congo</a></strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">upset Nigeria</a> after a gripping penalty shootout in the final, and go through to represent Africa in the intercontinental playoffs in March.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt</strong> Mohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 in Casablanca in October and made up for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/sadio-mane-penalty-africa-day-of-world-cup-qualifying-joy-and-pain-senegal-egypt">missing out on Qatar 2022</a> by reaching the finals with a game in hand.

      <h1>Rural hospitals were already short-staffed. Then came Trump's H-1B visa fee</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The White House’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications is adding extra pressure to health care systems in rural and low-income areas. Historically, the visa has been a critical pipeline for skilled health workers in hard-to-staff settings. Affected hospitals are already feeling the added strain.

      <h1>Trump administration takes major step toward dismantling the Education Department</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department. It represents a major step forward for the administration’s dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since President Donald Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March. Six planned agreements to be signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that would put the Department of Labor over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools.</p>

</ul>
<p>On Tuesday, the Guardian published an investigation into allegations against Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.</p>
<p>The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by the MLS Players’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.</p>
<p>Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.</p>
<p>Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”</p>
<p>Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”</p>
<p>Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.</p>
<p>Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.</p>

Jamiro Monteiro, a player Tanner had brought to the Union in 2019 before trading him to San Jose, was being substituted. Monteiro, clearly exhausted, trudged to the Earthquakes’ bench as referee Nima Saghafi extended his arm and ushered him along, briefly making contact.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Saghafi had touched the midfielder. In the first half, with Monteiro on the ground after being sent flying by a tackle, Saghafi placed his hand on Monteiro’s back, a small gesture meant to show concern.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Eliyahu ‘Eli’ Weinstein, pardoned by Trump in 2021, was sentenced to 37 years for defrauding investors out of $35m</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> man whose lengthy prison sentence for fraud convictions was commuted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in 2021 is now headed back to federal prison for another fraud conviction.</p>
<p>The US district judge Michael Shipp, sitting in Trenton, handed down a 37-year sentence on Friday to Eliyahu “Eli” Weinstein, 51, of Lakewood, who is also known as Mike Konig. Shipp also ruled that Weinstein must pay $44,294,803 in restitution, which is due immediately, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, became an international pariah after intelligence officers said to be acting on his orders abducted and murdered the Washington Post columnist and opposition critic Jamal Khashoggi. In a gruesome coda, it later emerged, the Saudi agents dismembered his body with a bone saw in order to dispose of the evidence.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The US president blasted ABC News as 'fake news' when a reporter asked the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence concluded he orchestrated. Trump said Prince Mohammed 'knew nothing about it', adding that the reporter should not 'embarrass our guest by asking something like that'. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report">US intelligence concluded</a> in 2021 that the crown prince approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler</p>

<p>That’s quite a stock market journey: from 180p <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/20/ocado-slash-shares-float-price">at listing 15 years ago</a> to the mighty heights of £29 during the locked-down Covid year of 2020 and now – oh dear – all the way back down to 180p. Welcome to Ocado, which looked like the future of grocery retailing once upon a time but now seems to be struggling to convince its most important customer of the virtues of robots and automation.</p>
<p>There is no positive gloss to put on news that Kroger, the US supermarket chain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/18/ocado-shares-drop-after-us-partner-announces-warehouse-closures-kroger">is closing three of its eight warehouses</a> that use Ocado’s technology.

If Ocado could prove the worth of its kit in the world’s largest consumer market, went the bulls’ argument, valuation doubts would disappear.</p>

      <h1>Trump faces criticism for referring to female Bloomberg reporter as ‘piggy’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Critics accuse the US president of trying to ‘shut women journalists up’ with ‘demeaning language’</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who has a history of making extremely personal attacks on female journalists, referred to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” during a clash onboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>
<p>While the remark did not initially get much attention, it picked up some traction on Tuesday and has drawn backlash from fellow journalists, including some who have previously been attacked by Trump themselves.</p>

<p>Manitoba’s NDP government is promising to build, saying in its third throne speech that it will construct an overpass at the location of a bus crash that killed 17 seniors, set up the province’s first supervised consumption site and build a new fuel-burning generation station to stave off a forecast power shortage.</p>

      <h1>Mahmood Mamdani on Zohran, Uganda and forced expulsion: ‘Who is part of the nation and who is not?’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>After being expelled from his homeland in 1972, the academic has grappled with questions of political belonging – a major theme of his son’s mayoral campaign</p>
<p>The night before Mahmood Mamdani was expelled from Uganda in 1972, a senior professor from the university where he had been employed as a lowly teaching assistant wandered into his family home, looking for spoils. The rest of the family had already left – for the UK, the US and Tanzania – but 26-year-old Mamdani had decided to remain until the final day of the three-month period that Idi Amin, the Ugandan president, had designated for all Asians to leave the country. Passing over the furniture and other remnants of decades of family life, the professor hit upon a carton of Johnnie Walker Red, which Mamdani invited him to take home.</p>

      <h1>Do city-owned grocery stores work?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani swept the election on a campaign all about affordability. One pillar of that platform was the idea of city-owned grocery stores. The thinking: Prices at these city-owned stores would be lower because they’d operate in city-owned spaces, so they wouldn’t have to pay rent or property taxes. Other cities have tried this. How'd the experiment go? But first: the world's largest official creditor and rising utility costs.</p>

<p>Last summer, a wildlife photographer saw, or believed he saw, a mountain lion in South Burlington, Vermont. While it’s possible, it is also remarkable: the apex predator was rendered extinct in northern New England in 1881 and the nearest confirmed breeding population is in North Dakota, 2,000 miles away.</p>
<p>But there could be in years hence more definitive sightings if Mighty Earth, a US-headquartered rewilding organization, convinces state and local authorities, along with Vermonters in general, that returning the top-level predator – known in various regions as the cougar, puma, panther and, in the north-east, catamount – to the region.</p>

      <p>When I was a college basketball player, some believed we were treated differently from other Black and Brown people. An event last weekend suggests otherwise</p>
<p>It was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.</p>
<p>I listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.</p>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Last week, the internet piled on President Trump's proposal for a 50-year mortgage. But maybe it's not as crazy as it sounds.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s focus on race backfires as voters punish economic failings</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race over the economy is costing the US president</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living, propelled by the sharp burst of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation">inflation</a> that peaked at 9% a year in July 2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the economy. The other theme was race.</p>
<p>The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’ economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/trump-tariffs-food">trying to recover</a> his economic narrative. But it may be too late.</p>

      <h1>The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron Lakers</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Shipped out of Dallas and dropped into Hollywood, Dončić has responded with a leaner body, a louder voice and a growing command of the Lakers’ post-LeBron future</p>
<p>It’s been nine and a half months since the trade that rocked the sports world <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">was broken via a Shams Charania tweet</a>. It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/11/dallas-mavericks-fire-nico-harrison-luka-doncic-trade">was let go by the team last week</a>, in a move Mavericks fans have been <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-02-08/hundreds-of-dallas-mavericks-fans-protest-luka-doncic-trade-to-lakers">loudly clamoring for</a> since news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood. And, as it turns out, the future is now.</p>
<p>While Dončić’s breakup with the Mavericks was both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/27/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-fallout-human-element">very public and very messy</a> (the Mavs were not shy about vocalizing their reasoning for the move, and painting the 26-year-old in an unflattering light in the process), the silver linings showed themselves quickly. Dončić might not have considered himself suited for the Los Angeles spotlight, but with his flair for the dramatic and a feel for the sport’s theater, playing for such a high-profile franchise has proved an unexpectedly good fit. And it couldn’t have worked out better for the Lakers: the team had been staring at an uncertain future, with the retirement of 40-year-old LeBron James looming, and Davis’s injury history creating a cloud of doubt around his ability to be the No 1 option in the eventual aftermath. Enter Luka stage right: a ticket to franchise salvation, equipped with the newfound motivation that can only be borne from being publicly and mercilessly dragged through the mud.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The so-called Judgment Day will generate millions of dollars and attract huge ratings, but leave boxing a little more broken</p>
<p>The unsurprising confirmation of “a colossal global showdown” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/12/anthony-joshua-jake-paul-december-miami-fight-netflix">between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua</a> arrived on Monday morning with a dull thud. That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.</p>
<p>Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.</p>

<p>Robert Garcia, the ranking member on of the House oversight committee, which released a tranche of new Epstein documents last week, said that Trump “has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey Epstein investigation”.</p>

<p>A US judge on Monday found evidence of “government misconduct” in how a prosecutor aligned with Donald Trump secured criminal charges against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey">James Comey</a>, the former FBI director, and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey’s defense team.</p>
<p>Last week, prosecutors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/james-comey-evidence-judge">were ordered</a> to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, with the court saying it was concerned that the US justice department’s position on Comey had been to “indict first and investigate later”.</p>

      <h1>US will label supposed Venezuelan drug cartel ‘headed by Maduro’ as terrorist organization</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>Experts believe decision is designed to pressure Venezuela’s leader into stepping down with threat of military force</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-drugs-regime-change">Is US preparing to attack Venezuela and how has Maduro regime responded?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The US has said it will designate a putative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuelan</a> drug cartel allegedly led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> as a foreign terrorist organization, as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages over its crusade against Venezuela’s authoritarian leader.</p>
<p>The move to target the already proscribed group, the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), was announced by Marco Rubio on Sunday. “Headed by the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” the US secretary of state tweeted, generating excitement among hardline adversaries of Maduro who interpreted the announcement as proof Washington was preparing to intensify its push to force the South American dictator from power.</p>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>Tomorrow's when we’re supposed to learn more about how imports and exports have been faring from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though the 43-day government shutdown may still delay that data release. What might those numbers be able to tell us (whenever they do come out) about some of the impacts of the president’s tariffs? Plus, China has a glut of EVs, and that oversupply is starting to spill over into the rest of the world.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Trump tells Republicans to vote to release Epstein files, in reversal of previous stance</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The US president says he backs lawmakers’ efforts to release the files before an expected House vote this week. Plus: is there a dark side to gratitude?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed"><strong>Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide">reversing his previous resistance to such a move</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why the sudden U-turn?</strong> The House was expected to vote to release the files anyway, as early as tomorrow. There has been fervent suspicion within Trump’s usually loyal Maga base that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite with whom the financier associated – including Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Has Trump made up with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been calling for the files to be released?</strong> No, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/17/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-democrats-world-cup-us-politics-live-news-updates">doubled down on his attacks</a> against the Republican lawmaker, despite his reversal on resisting the release of the Epstein files. Greene, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks">she hopes they can make it up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does Israel’s limited data tell us about the rate of detainee casualties?</strong> Israeli authorities only provided comprehensive data for the first eight months of the war. During this period, official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.</p>

Currently, a pact bans the sale of soy beans — Brazil’s largest agricultural export — grown on Amazon land deforested after 2008. Then, shares in Japanese retail and travel-related companies fell after China urged citizens not to visit the country over remarks made by Japan's prime minister about Taiwan.</p>

      <h1>Bridging the uncanny valley of lab-grown meat</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>About a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from our food systems, and livestock production is a big part of that. Experts largely agree that one of the biggest actions individuals can take to lower emissions is to eat less meat.</p>
<p>But that's a hard sell for a lot of consumers. Americans have actually been eating more meat in recent years, and sales of plant-based meat alternatives have dropped.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies out there trying to innovate climate-friendly meat and alternatives for the future.</p>
<p>For our podcast &quot;How We Survive,&quot; Marketplace's Amy Scott visits a lab at Columbia University where researchers are figuring out how to make a more convincing and enjoyable fake meat.</p>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The Seahawks quarterback has looked like an MVP this season. But his old failings returned in Los Angeles on Sunday</p>
<p>The biggest game of Week 11 was undoubtedly the matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks. Both teams came in with 7-2 records, and were seemingly evenly matched on both sides of the ball, with dynamic offenses and stingy defenses. In the end, it was a defensive battle that the Rams won, 21-19, by the skin of their teeth.</p>
<p>Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who had played <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/14/nfl-midseason-ish-awards-darnolds-rise-to-mvp-and-a-surprising-browns-rookie">at a near-MVP level this season</a> for the most part, did absolutely nothing to help his team – and plenty to hurt them. Darnold matched his career high with four interceptions, completing 29 of 44 passes for 279 yards, no touchdowns, those picks, and a passer rating of 45.5.</p>

<p>Josh Allen has become the first NFL player to have two games with three touchdowns passing and three rushing. He achieved the feat as he led the Buffalo Bills (7-3) to victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4). Allen’s last TD was a rugged nine-yard run with 2:35 left that put the game away. The Bills benched struggling receiver Keon Coleman in a bid to spark their passing game, and each of Allen’s three touchdown passes went for 25 yards or more. He finished 19 of 30 for 317 yards, and the Bills overcame his two first-half interceptions. The game featured nine lead changes.</p>

      <p>Do small business owners think that Visa and Mastercard won’t just recoup their fees elsewhere?</p>
<p>Want to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.</p>
<p>I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who carries cash anymore? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over something that’s clearly a thing of the past?</p>

<p>The March 23, 1994, death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a reformer on the cusp of winning the Mexican presidency who promised a more just and democratic country, holds a space in the country's consciousness like the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy does in the United States. Federal authorities in Mexico recently arrested a 64-year-old man in Tijuana in connection with Colosio’s killing.</p>

(date: 2025-11-16)
      <p>
      <p>Reports that fire crews were ordered to leave original site of blaze prompt tough questions for city and LAFD leaders</p>
<p>Concerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the <a href="https://www.wildfirela.org/history/">most destructive</a> in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering.</p>
<p>Now, questions remain about how leaders at the Los Angeles fire department responded to a fire that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/california-wildfires-pacific-palisades-los-angeles">leveled entire communities</a>, and who within the agency knew about concerns the fire could still pose a threat. A former LA city councilor says the aftermath and recovery effort should serve as a Pearl Harbor moment for the city, which should never again be in a position with flames encroaching on all sides.</p>

<p>Fears that it would take weeks or even months for flight schedules in the US to return to normal in the wake of the US federal government shutdown do not appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal for travel, experts say.</p>
<p>That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning to work, according to the Department of Transportation.</p>

      <p>Leona Tate has built a center at the former school she and her two six-year-old friends braved angry crowds to attend – the same day as Ruby Bridges’ better-known experience</p>
<p>Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks. Others were holding picket signs against school integration.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget it,” Etienne said. “I saw this one lady was pregnant and had a garbage can top in her hand. I’m wondering, at six years old, what could I have done at six years old to these people to make them act the way they were acting? I really thought that if they could get to me, they’d want to kill me. I didn’t know why. What had I done? I was just going to school.”</p>

(date: 2025-11-15)
      <p>
      <p>Seemingly identical signatures appeared on clemency orders, which White House blamed on technical error</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump’s signature with others that are distinctively variable.</p>
<p>The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president’s signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player <a href="https://apnews.com/television-fc6318ff6f3d4133890956a7576999e6">Darryl Strawberry</a>, former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November.</p>

<p>US district judge Rita Lin in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from cancelling funding to the university based on alleged discrimination without giving notice to affected faculty and conducting a hearing, among other requirements.</p>

<p>Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries.</p>
<p>Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll-ups”, acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality.</p>

(date: 2025-11-15)
      <p>
      <p>Official Trump social media accounts have been using The Life of a Showgirl snippets to promote his agenda. Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whitehouse/video/7568317055292738830">first</a>, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569701713712631095?lang=en">One</a>, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569982996640501023?lang=en">other</a>, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/09/white-stripes-trump-lawsuit-seven-nation-army">The White Stripes</a> and the estate of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89w28w13zxo">Isaac Hayes</a> have both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/08/olivia-rodrigo-trump-video">Olivia Rodrigo condemned</a> the administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).</p>

<p>The texts, released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday, show that as early as June 2018, the pair were devising responses to the gathering storm of public outrage about Epstein’s criminal history, his favorable treatment by the justice system, and his friendships with powerful figures in business, politics and academia.</p>

      <p>Move diverges from July memo negating need for further inquiries, and comes amid intense Trump campaign to block files</p>
<p>Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi">announced</a> on Friday afternoon that she had assigned Jay Clayton, the interim US attorney for the southern district of New York, to lead the investigation into Donald Trump’s political adversaries and their ties to Jeffrey Epstein, hours after the president directed her to do so.</p>
<p>“Jay Clayton is one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country, and I’ve asked him to take the lead,” the US attorney general said of the lawyer, who also served as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during Trump’s first administration. “As with all matters, the department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.”</p>

      <p>We want to hear from people in the US about how Donald Trump’s economic policies may be affecting their plans for holiday shopping</p>
<p>We’d like to find out more about your holiday spending plans this year. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/politics/trump-affordability-economy.html">reported on Friday</a> that the Trump administration is pivoting to an affordability message and considering lowering some tariffs rates.</p>
<p>The administration has floated policies that would lower prices for coffee and fruit, spoken about a 50-year mortgage proposal, and Trump has mused on social media about giving Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenue.</p>

<p>Celtic are to accelerate talks with Wilfried Nancy over the weekend as the Columbus Crew manager edges closer to replacing Brendan Rodgers in Glasgow. Celtic are understood to have informed the Major League Soccer side on Friday of their plans, with any compensation required to coax the Frenchman not regarded as problematic. Nancy is believed to be keen on the switch.</p>
<p>Celtic hope to have Nancy in place by the time they visit St Mirren next weekend, which would bring an end to Martin O’Neill’s caretaker spell. O’Neill was due to meet Celtic’s main shareholder, Dermot Desmond, in London on Friday. The second tenure of Rodgers in Glasgow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/27/brendan-rodgers-resigns-celtic-martin-oneill">ended in acrimony</a> in late October, with Desmond taking public aim at the former Liverpool manager.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Even though we haven’t gotten recent economic data because of the government shutdown, there’s still plenty of speculation that the next Fed meeting will be a contentious one. We hear from Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, about how the slowing job market and creeping inflation may force the guardians of interest rates into uncomfortable compromises. Plus, a look at why the Trump administration is lowering some tariffs on imported food items from Latin America. And, a chat with McKinsey’s Michael Chui about how companies are utilizing AI and what that means for the workforce.</p>

      <p>Text messages released by US House show convicted sex offender coaching Maga influencer on political messaging. Plus, readers’ favourite photo booth moments 100 years after its invention</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon">a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon</a> during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.</p>
<p><strong>What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?</strong> Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with</strong> <strong>rest of the Epstein files?</strong> Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it?

<p>Pep Guardiola has done a lot with his 1,000 matches as a manager. At Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, he has lifted 40 trophies (including three Community Shields, because why wouldn’t you count them?), yet not even this fact quantifies the way Guardiola has defined an entire era (or two) of the sport.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Donald Trump is set to cut import taxes on products like coffee, bananas, and beef as part of trade agreements with four Latin American countries, aimed at easing food prices. A tariff of 10% will stay on most goods from Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador. But staples like coffee and bananas, which the U.S. can’t produce enough of, will be exempt.</p>

<p>Days before MPs are set to cast their vote on the Liberal budget, interim Parliamentary Budget Officer Jason Jacques is calling the government’s accounting into question, suggesting there’s a less than 10 per cent chance it will stay within its deficit targets.</p>

<p>The convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> apparently served as a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon">Steve Bannon</a> during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.</p>

      <h1>From conscience to platforming Trump: inside the slow death of ‘woke’ ESPN</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>The broadcaster was once attacked by critics for being too progressive. But that stance appears to have changed for good in Trump’s second term</p>
<p>“What happened to the Redskins, by the way?” Donald Trump asked in <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/11/12/mcafee-defends-trump-interview-amid-backlash-over-veterans-day-appearance/">an interview on the Pat McAfee Show</a> that notably did not stick to sports. His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.</p>
<p>Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline">a government shut down</a> that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.</p>

      <h1>Bytes: Week in Review – Wikipedia urges AI companies to pay for its data, again</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>This week we learned the Japanese investment firm Softbank sold all of its stake in the juggernaut chipmaker Nvidia. We'll get into why on today's “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.” Plus, Apple is reportedly pushing back the release of its thinnest iPhone, the Air, and Wikipedia is asking AI companies, once again, to pay for scraping its data.</p>
<p>But first, back to that big move by Softbank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son. It cashed out its stake in Nvidia in October, the same month that the chipmaker hit a <span class="math inline">\(5 trillion valuation. The \)</span>5.8 billion it netted will be redirected to OpenAI, part of a promised $30 billion to be invested in the maker of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, about what all this means.</p>

      <p>With the season more than halfway done, we look at the outstanding figures from the 2025 campaign so far</p>
<p><strong>Sam Darnold, QB, Seahawks.</strong> With apologies to Jonathan Taylor, we know how this story goes. MVP doesn’t stand for Most Valuable Player anymore. It stands for Most Valuable Quarterback on a 12-win team with a nice storyline. That gives us three frontrunners: Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye and Darnold.</p>

<p>The headline on Arsenal’s website in early August 2023 was short and sweet. “Teenage trio to join Watford on dual agreement,” it read. That trio included Michelle Agyemang and Katie Reid, two players whose names were known to the keenest of fans then and who have since become part of mainstream conversation for hugely positive reasons. More recently they have hit the headlines for a more devastating reason, having both sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</p>

<p>A British political commentator who was detained by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> authorities in the US over his pro-Palestinian advocacy said shortly after returning to the UK on Thursday that his detention was “less an attack on me and more an attack on Americans and the rights of Americans themselves”.</p>
<p>Sami Hamdi arrived in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> on Thursday , three weeks after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco international airport while on a speaking tour in the US. He agreed to leave the country after being guaranteed the right to apply for a new US visa, which he says he plans to do.</p>

<p>Democrats appear more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting in next year’s congressional elections following the party’s victories in recent state and local contests, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which showed Republican President Donald Trump’s approval steady at 40%.</p>
<p>The six-day poll, which closed on Wednesday, showed 44% of registered voters who called themselves Democrats said they were “very enthusiastic” about voting in the November 3, 2026, elections, compared with 26% of Republicans who said the same. Some 79% of Democrats said they would regret it if they didn’t vote in the election, compared to 68% of Republicans.</p>

Charvet Drucker was on a rented 20-foot (6-meter) boat near her home on an island in the Salish Sea about 40 miles northwest of Seattle when she spotted a pod of at least eight killer whales, also known as orcas. Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department has downplayed the possibility that other men were involved in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s abuse of teen girls, an email released on 12 November as part of the House oversight committee’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/epstein-emails-trump-spotlight">Epstein investigation</a> shows an exchange between the late financier and an associate where they discuss “girls” and travel.</p>
<p>Analysis by the Guardian found Epstein sent an email asking “what is your schedule?” on 23 July 2010 to an associate. The latter responded the next morning saying: “the other girl name is [redacted].” The Guardian is withholding the associate’s name, as attempts to identify and contact him were unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>Guardian reporter Hilary Andersson reports from the Oklahoma state penitentiary in McAlester where Tremane Wood, 46, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Thursday. In an extraordinary turn of events, Kevin Stitt, the state’s Republican governor, accepted the Oklahoma pardon and parole board’s recommendation that Wood’s sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. Wood was convicted of felony murder in the stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farm worker from Montana, during a botched robbery in 2001</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> daycare worker whose arrest by federal agents last week sparked widespread outrage has been released from custody.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Diana Santillana Galeano’s attorney <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/11/13/north-center-daycare-teacher-detained-ice-released-custody">said</a> she was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Clay county, Indiana, on Wednesday night. Her release followed a federal judge’s ruling earlier in the day that her arrest was “unlawful” as she had not had a preliminary bond hearing.</p>

      <p>Lawsuit against US government alleges ‘life-threatening’ medical neglect and says residents frequently go hungry</p>
<p>Seven people detained at California’s largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center have sued the US government, alleging they have been denied essential medications, frequently go hungry and are housed in a “decrepit” facility.</p>
<p>The federal class-action complaint filed against ICE on Wednesday challenges the “inhumane conditions” at the California City detention center, which opened in late August inside a shuttered state prison. The suit alleges “life-threatening” medical neglect, with the plaintiffs saying they have been denied cancer treatment, basic disability accommodations and regular insulin for diabetes.</p>

      <p>Britain was always going to prefer homegrown technology for the SMR reactors at Wylfe. The US would have done the same</p>
<p>It had all been so harmonious two months ago. “Together with the US, we’re building a golden age of nuclear that puts both countries at the forefront of global innovation and investment,” purred the prime minister about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/golden-age-of-nuclear-delivers-uk-us-deal-on-energy-security">the new “landmark” UK-US nuclear partnership</a>.</p>
<p>Now there’s an atomic split over the first significant decision. The UK has allocated Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/13/us-disappointed-that-rolls-royce-will-build-uks-first-small-modular-reactors">to host three small modular reactors (SMRs)</a> to be built by the British developer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup">Rolls-Royce</a> SMR.

<p>When Senate Democrats decided in September to use the government funding bill to put up a fight over expiring healthcare subsides, it set the stage for a 43-day federal government shutdown marked by turmoil for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, a battle over food benefits, thousands of cancelled flights, and a rare Democratic stand against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s second-term agenda that progressives had been demanding since the election.</p>
<p>Each week brought new disruptions and frustrations, until a group of seven moderate Democrats and one independent struck a deal to reopen the government in exchange for a promised – but not guaranteed – vote on the healthcare subsidies by mid-December.</p>

<p>According to Forbes, which analyzed data from the US Department of Labor, the Trump Organization sought to bring in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/11/12/trump-organization-record-foreign-workers-visas-2025/">at least 184 foreign workers</a> in 2025 for temporary positions at the US president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, two golf clubs and his Virginia winery.</p>

      <h1>How the US is still removing Indigenous children from their families at alarming rates – video</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>For centuries, the US government tried to erase Indigenous identity, with boarding schools, adoptions and a chilling mission: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”</p>
<p>In 1978, a law was passed to protect Native American families. But it didn’t fix the system. Today, Native children are still being removed at shocking rates. In South Dakota, they’re 13% of the child population but 74% of the children in the foster system.</p>

      <p>One email, released by Democrats on House oversight committee, says Trump ‘spent hours’ with one trafficking victim. Plus, Al Gore wonders if ‘bullying’ Trump prompted Bill Gates to backtrack on climate</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Newly released emails <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/jeffrey-epstein-new-emails-donald-trump">suggest Donald Trump knew about the conduct</a> of the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including one memo in which Epstein said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls” he trafficked, and another that said Trump had “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.</p>
<p><strong>What do the emails say?</strong> One message from Epstein to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in April 2011, mentions Trump by name, saying: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.” The redacted name was Virginia Giuffre, who had described being trafficked, though she did not accuse Trump of abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Who voted against their caucus?</strong> Six Democrats voted for the bill: Adam Gray of California, Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine. Two Republicans voted against it: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida.</p>

It was tucked into the new farm bill, which was also approved last night, and funds the Agriculture Department through September. We'll hear more. Plus, are government institutions shifting resources away from the working class? Professor Clara Mattei argues that's the case.</p>

Then, attendees of COP30 are hoping for a U.N.-backed deal to impose a levy on emissions for large ships.

<p>Former FBI director James Comey and current New York State Attorney General Letitia James have argued their recent indictments are politically motivated prosecutions fuelled by Donald Trump's animus. They say the appointment of Trump's hand-picked choice to oversee their cases negates their indictments altogether.</p>

      <p>The showdown channels centuries of Spanish tension and pride – and may soon collide with the NBA’s ambitions to expand into Europe</p>
<p>Scores of fans filed past the silhouettes of cranes and construction work surrounding Barcelona’s Camp Nou last Friday night. But they weren’t there for the world famous soccer stadium. Instead, the sea of Barça jerseys was heading for the club’s basketball arena, the Palau Blaugrana. There was an expectant but apprehensive buzz in the air – the night marked a big occasion: Real Madrid were in town.</p>
<p>It’s widely accepted that the biggest rivalry in basketball is between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#Records_by_franchise">between them</a> they have won almost half of all championships in NBA history. The Lakers-Celtics showdowns of the 1980s went beyond basketball and embodied different Americas: West Coast glitz versus East Coast grit; flashy fastbreak basketball versus fundamentals; and, frankly, though perhaps sometimes oversimplistically, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/29/basketball-magic-johnson-larry-bird">Black versus white</a>.</p>

      <p>After 42-day standoff, government is back open – and minority party won no concessions from party in power</p>
<p>More than 42 days ago, beleaguered congressional Democrats employed a tactic they were not known for using – refusing to fund the government unless their demands, in this case, an extension of tax credits that lowered costs for Affordable Care Act health plans, were met.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Wednesday evening, and the federal government is back open, the Democrats’ resistance breached by the combined forces of Congress’s Republican majorities and a splinter group of Democratic senators who provided just enough votes to get a funding bill past the chamber’s filibuster.</p>

<p>The US House of Representatives voted to pass the funding bill to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">end the longest government shutdown</a> in US history. Trump signed the bill into law on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The legislation comes in the wake of a Senate-brokered compromise in which a handful of Democrats voted toforego the extension of expiring healthcare subsidies, which have been at the heart of the long impasse. The bill extends government funding at current levels through January. Three year-long provisions, which fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations, are also included.</p>

<p>The longest US government shutdown in history ended on Wednesday after more than 42 days, following the House of Representative’s passage of a bill negotiated by Republicans and a splinter group of Democrat-aligned senators.</p>
<p>The compromise sets the stage for government operations to return to normal through January, while leaving unresolved the issue of expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare health plans, which most Democrats demanded be extended in any deal to reopen the government.</p>

<p>The AI chatbot, which was created by Musk’s xAI artificial intelligence company and automatically responds to users on X (formerly Twitter) when prompted, generated responses such as “I believe Donald Trump won the 2020 election” in response to user questions about the vote. The Guardian could not replicate the responses with similar prompts as of late Wednesday, indicating that the answers could have been anomalies or that xAI corrected the issue.</p>

<p>Paul had originally been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis on 14 November at the Kaseya Center, but the event was cancelled after Davis was removed from the card <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/boxing/article/gervonta-davis-faces-new-domestic-violence-allegations-in-civil-lawsuit-filed-just-weeks-before-jake-paul-bout-234321093.html">amid domestic violence allegations.</a> Davis’s former partner, Courtney Rossel, filed a civil lawsuit in Miami-Dade County accusing the lightweight champion of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Miami Gardens police confirmed they are investigating the alleged incident, which Rossel says occurred at the strip club where she works. She was granted a restraining order shortly afterwards.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In a new batch of emails <a href="https://x.com/OversightDems/status/1988600468990484626?s=20">released by Democrats</a> on the House oversight committee, Jeffrey Epstein wrote that Donald Trump knew about the late financier and sex-offender’s conduct. In the three emails released, Epstein apparently told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump <strong>“spent hours”</strong> at his house with one of Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>In two other emails to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that <strong>“of course he knew about the girls”</strong>, referring to the now-president. According to the exchanges, Epstein also solicited Wolff’s advice about how he should handle Trump discussing their friendship in an interview with CNN. “I think you should let him hang himself,” Wolff writes. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.”</p>

<p>The release of the three <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/3-emails_redacted.pdf">messages</a> by Democrats on the House oversight committee is likely to heap significant pressure on the White House to publish in full the so-called Epstein files reportedly detailing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/jeffrey-epstein-trump-maga-turmoil">long-running scandal</a> that has overshadowed Trump’s second term in office.</p>

      <p>Tremane Wood was convicted of a murder his brother had confessed to. Now a Republican governor will decide whether he dies on Thursday</p>

<p>For 16 of his last 21 years in prison, following his conviction for the murder of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf, he has been confined, often alone, to a series of windowless concrete cells in the state penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, in an underground block that prisoners have compared to a tomb.</p>

      <p>Saikat Chakrabarti wants to turn Trump’s gilded ballroom into a museum on authoritarianism</p>
<p>Rooting out corruption in government is at the center of Saikat Chakrabarti’s campaign for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a>. And if elected next year, the 39-year-old former Silicon Valley engineer – now running to succeed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> in her long-held San Francisco seat – says he would put it on display for every American to see.</p>
<p>As part of his anti-corruption agenda, Chakrabarti says he would introduce legislation to turn Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom">gilded White House ballroom</a> into the “Smithsonian Museum on Corruption and Authoritarianism”. Looking ahead to a post-Trump Washington, Chakrabarti envisions filling the 90,000 sq ft structure, to be built in place of the now-demolished East Wing, with exhibits dedicated to the “modern dangers posed by the current wannabe dictator, the ongoing threat of authoritarianism, assaults on the rule of law and the pervasive corruption of the billionaire class”.</p>

<p>Conservative commentators and media figures, some of whom spent years pushing conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death, have accused the government of covering up the hedge fund manager’s crimes, with calls growing for Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to resign.</p>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump and Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte have floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage as a potential way to make homebuying more affordable.

And later, 47 economists filed an amicus brief in Trump's tariffs case before the Supreme Court. We'll unpack what they said.</p>

<p><strong>What do we know about who the</strong> <strong>detainees are?</strong> Despite the administration accusing the deportees of being members of Tren de Aragua, an organized crime gang, the report found that just 3% had been convicted in the US of a violent crime.</p>

      <h1>A refugee’s deportation rattles a deeply conservative town: ‘What Trump has done is not Christlike’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Binod Shah, a refugee from Bhutan, went to church, got married and started an auto shop in Twin Falls, Idaho. But an arrest record got him caught in the ICE dragnet</p>
<p>Stephanie Shah kept her eyes on the winding road as rain streaked across the windshield. Her husband, Binod Shah, sat in silence beside her, staring out the window. It was late evening in Washington state on 23 March, and they had been driving all day, trading shifts, barely speaking, while their nine-month-old son dozed beneath a blanket in the backseat. The sky hung low and gray, and evergreens, soaked and still, stood witness along the road. Inside the car, a Nepali-Christian folk song played quietly on repeat. At some point, Binod reached over and rested his hand on Stephanie’s leg. It wasn’t reassurance. It felt more like a final touch.</p>
<p>When the baby started to cry, Stephanie pulled over and together they changed his diaper, working without words. Then Binod leaned down, kissed his son’s forehead, and began to cry.</p>

      <h1>Republican disquiet over hemp ban threatens passage of bill to end shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Kentucky trio oppose provision restricting hemp-derived products, with House to vote on Wednesday on funding bill</p>
<p>A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.</p>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>After 43 days, the government shutdown could end today. But there are still lingering questions: When will food stamps be distributed to beneficiaries? When will government workers receive paychecks? As for all of the economic data we missed while government agencies were closed? It won’t be released immediately once the government reopens — far from it. Then, the shuttering of the IRS' Direct File program and climate talks in Brazil.</p>

He told business leaders in Melbourne that there had been multiple attempts to hack into transportation, telecommunications, water, and energy networks. Plus, a multibillion-dollar natural gas platform off the coast of Senegal promised to bring economic prosperity, but fishermen there say the development has caused disruption and unemployment.</p>

<p>Swimming across the river has remained treacherous ever since. But migrants never stopped risking their lives to set foot on US soil –and in 2023,those numbers reach record highs as Eagle Pass, the seat of Maverick county, became the epicenter of growing backlash over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">the Biden administration</a>’s immigration policies.</p>

      <h1>Are there enough workers to build geothermal energy networks?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Combatting climate change will likely require a multi-pronged approach to renewable energy generation. After all, it's not sunny or windy everywhere all the time. Geothermal energy, which harnesses the natural heat generated by the earth, can significantly shrink the carbon footprint of heating and cooling buildings. Those systems are currently just a small part of the HVAC market. But the Department of Energy wants to accelerate production by 10% a year. Rae Solomon at KUNC in Northern Colorado reports on how one geothermal project in the municipality of Hayden is progressing.</p>

Monkman is one of three Manitobans who will sit on Hockey Canada’s first Indigenous Advisory Circle, which will work to combat anti-Indigenous racism in hockey, and promote inclusivity within the game.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)

Plus: Cities issue bonds at a record pace, we explain the consequences of Trump’s proposal to back 50-year mortgages and one report shows real wage growth has slowed to 2%.</p>

      <h1>Carlos Alcaraz battles back to beat Taylor Fritz: ATP Finals tennis – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Taylor Fritz did all he could, but it still wasn’t enough to beat Carlos Alcaraz, who recovered after losing the first set to win an epic in three</p>
<p><strong>*Alcaraz 1-1 Fritz</strong> The last thing Fritz will want is for Alcraraz to rush through an easy hold and he makes 0-15, then attacks a second serve with a backhand down the line, as we suggested he should, for 0-30. And, though Alcaraz halves his arrears, Faritz runs around his forehand to clout down the line, raising two break points; the first disappears with an overhit forehand, the second with a service winner. Up advantage, though, Alcaraz errs, and this is already ridiculously enjoyable, Fritz taking control of the next rally by landing a forehand on to the baseline and seeing it home with backhands down the line to earn a third break point. And this time he looks ready to take it, racing to net when a drop sits up … but Alcaraz reads him and puts away the volley! The anticipation there was spooky, and there’s something about watching him play that’s almost wrong, stuff that shouldn’t be possible happening with such regularity it feels unreal, or staged. And that’s exactly the next point, a no-look drop, discharged with Fritz expecting a booming cross-court shot, followed up with a perfectly disguised and perfect lob; from there, Alcaraz sees out the hold, and these two games have been of absurdly high standard.</p>
<p><strong>Alcaraz 0-1 Fritz* (denotes server)</strong> A forehand clouted wide gives Alcaraz 0-15 … but that’s nothing a service winner can’t solve. At 30-15, though, a tame forehand into the net puts him under immediate pressure … but that’s nothing an ace can’t serve. He quickly makes 40-30, too, but a backhand winner sizzles past him cross, and another netted forehand means Alcaraz has advantage. Fritz looks nervous, reflecting how well he knows he’s playing: this is is his time. He saves break point with a forehand winner, but is soon down advantage again, totally dominated in the next rally. Also again, though, he restores deuce, and this time an ace raises game point … only to be followed by a double. On the one hand, this isn’t the game Fritz had in mind when he opted to serve but, on the other, if he can see out the tension and hold, it’ll fortify him with confidence. Meantime, though, an ace earns another advantage, but again, he can’t see it out; what a start to the match this is. AND HAVE A LOOK! Again up advantage and this tome at the net with a simple putaway there for him, Fritz picks out Alcaraz who hoists a lob, then deals with the tweener sent at him in riposte via volley. That was another terrific exchange, was, restoring deuce, but Fritz again makes his ad, this time punishing down an ace to secure a nine-minute hold. MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE.</p>

      <p>Injuries are non-life-threatening after mobile lounge moving passengers between terminal and plane hit dock</p>
<p>A vehicle transporting passengers at a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a>-area airport hit a dock at the building on Monday, sending 18 people to the hospital, according to officials.</p>
<p>A mobile lounge, which transports passengers between the terminal and aircraft, struck the dock at an angle at about 4.30pm at Washington Dulles international airport as it was pulling up to the building, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said in a statement. The dock is where the vehicle stops to let people into the concourse.</p>

      <h1>Tariffs to hit a dinner table favorite: Italian pasta</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration is moving to levy tariffs of over 90% on popular Italian pasta brands on “anti-dumping” grounds. We look at how the move could impact grocery prices for the pantry staple. Plus, even though we don’t have a government jobs report this month due to the shutdown, private sector numbers give us an idea of the state of the labor market. And, as New Mexico moves to provide free childcare, a look at how daycare benefits businesses.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah">Utah</a> judge has handed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> a win in the continuing national fight over voting districts by ordering a new map that creates a House seat in a Democratic-leaning area, in a state where Republicans currently control all four positions.</p>
<p>The judge, Dianna Gibson, <a href="http://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/document-2025-11-10T234354.061.pdf">ruled just before a midnight deadline</a> on Monday that a revised map submitted by the Republican-controlled state legislature “unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats”, throwing out lawmakers’ second attempt to draw districts.</p>

      <p>
      <p>As of Tuesday, more than 1,100 flights had been canceled, and more than 540 had been delayed</p>
<p>Air travelers should expect worsening cancellations and delays this week even if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">US government shutdown</a> ends, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rolled out deeper cuts to flights at 40 of the nation’s major airports Tuesday, officials said.</p>
<p>The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at the airports in question, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown">canceling</a> more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday – and again to 10% on Friday.</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/trump-bbc-legal-action">welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures</a> after a campaign against the UK’s public broadcaster peaked over the criticism that a 2024 documentary used a misleading edit of a Trump speech on the day of the January 6 insurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Why did the BBC’s director general and News CEO resign?</strong> They did so after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage.</p>
<p><strong>What did the documentary show?</strong> Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, splicing him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video">telling supporters to walk to the US capitol</a> and then to “fight like hell”.</p>
<p><strong>So Trump didn’t tell people to “fight”?</strong> No, he absolutely did, many times. According to the January 6 select committee <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Report_of_the_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_the_January_6th_Attack_on_the_United_States_Capitol">report</a>, “he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/why-bbc-resignations-trump-speech-edit">exhorting the crowd to fight</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Trump doing this?</strong> The development “is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes,” writes the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-threat-media-attacks">Guardian US media correspondent, Jeremy Barr</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are the spyware companies?</strong> Paragon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite; and NSO Group, which the Biden administration had in 2021 accused of engaging in business “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”. Paragon made a deal the Trump administration in September to provide services to immigration agents.</p>

      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino chooses caution with time running out before the World Cup</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Weston McKennie remains at Juventus due to a manager change, and the US remain vulnerable to outside elements</p>
<p>When Weston McKennie signed for Juventus in 2020, it had only been 30 days since Andrea Pirlo was made the Italian club’s manager. A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – or <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/mitarbeiterhistorie/verein/506">his seventh, if you count the interim head coaches</a>. It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value. Rather than the usual routine of a manager trying to push McKennie out of the club, only to realize that there’s a reason <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/kader/verein/506/saison_id/2025/plus/1">only three players in the squad</a> have been at the club longer, Spalletti has given McKennie starts in all three matches he’s overseen. The 27-year-old has played all but five available minutes in that span.</p>

      <p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Border patrol arrested José Bertin Cruz-Estrada while he was battling a wildfire in Washington. He is now in Mexico, separated from his family in Oregon</p>
<p>José Bertin Cruz-Estrada was responding to a wildfire in Washington state on 27 August when four unmarked vehicles drove up to his crew’s remote location in a national forest.</p>
<p>Cruz-Estrada, part of a team of 20 Oregon-based firefighters, had spent a week hiking through dense terrain, battling smoke and clearing fallen trees and other debris to prevent the Bear Gulch fire, a 9,000-acre <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/inside-the-fight-to-slow-down-was-roller-coaster-bear-gulch-fire/">blaze</a>, from growing. That morning, they were waiting for a taskforce leader to provide instructions, but Cruz-Estrada quickly realized the men arriving in trucks were not emergency responders.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has grabbed the headlines after threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn (£760m) for what the corporation has accepted was a misleading edit of his speech on 6 January 2021 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.

      <p>Some AI companies are turning to nuclear power to meet demand for electricity. But traditional nuclear plants can take decades to bring online.</p>
<p>Now some tech companies are partnering with startups trying to build small, modular nuclear reactors, designed with speed in mind. One such company, Kairos, has a deal with Google to build a fleet of modular reactors. To do so, it’s relying on a technique first developed in the mid-20th century: molten-salt cooling.</p>

      <h1>Bob Dylan’s 25 Most Essential Bootleg Series Recordings</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Not only has Bob Dylan's “vault” shown to be an endless trove of treasures, but The Bootleg Series itself has evolved into more of a curated collection of stories than a mere dumping ground for unreleased material.</p>

      <h1>Mark Cuban made the Mavericks relevant. But is his legacy rotten? | Lee Escobedo</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>The businessman shaped Dallas into an NBA force after years in the wilderness. But problems with the team only worsened when he sold up</p>
<p>The year 2000 cracked open like a glow stick, flooding Dallas with new money – and a new Mavericks owner, who had made his money selling his streaming site just before the dot-com crash. Like the 1990s Mavs, Mark Cuban wasn’t polished – and he sure as hell wasn’t subtle. He was brash and argumentative, clashed with refs, and clapped too hard whenever Dirk Nowitzki buried a three. The internet age, in the form of Cuban, crashed courtside when he bought the team for $285m. Gone was the era of distant owners watching occasional games from the executive boxes: the fan was in control of the team now. Cuban had hacked reality.</p>
<p>Cuban’s thesis was simple: never play by their rules. The Mavs were his start-up. He improved nutrition, upgraded hotels for road games, bought a team plane, filled lockers with PlayStations, and fought the NBA’s lawyers with the defiance of a rapper clapping off hundos in a strip club. This went against the NBA’s old boys’ club. For all his dot-com cache, Cuban was punk in practice.</p>

<p>Canada's Unknown Soldier — a casualty of the First World War — was brought home to be interred in Ottawa 25 years ago, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission forbids any attempt at identification. Advances in DNA technology mean that in future wars, the chances that soldiers won't be identified are slim. Does the concept of an Unknown Soldier still have meaning to a new, on-demand generation, or will it become a relic of a bygone era?</p>

<p>Turning Point USA, the influential rightwing college group founded by Charlie Kirk, has brought Kirk’s message to a campus with a long history of leftwing activism two months after his death.</p>
<p>An event at the University of California, Berkeley, on Monday evening marked the chaotic last stop of the American Comeback tour, which Kirk had just begun at the time of his death at Utah Valley University. In the aftermath of Kirk’s fatal shooting, the events have come to serve as memorials, with prominent conservative speakers, including JD Vance, highlighting the staggering impact the controversial rightwing influencer’s death has had on American politics.</p>

      <h1>Senate approves funding deal to end longest US government shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Bill, which passed 60-40 but does not include key health concession demanded by Democrats, now heads to House</p>
<p>The Senate on Monday approved afunding package that is expected to bring to a close the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/government-shutdown-longest-history">longest government shutdown</a> in US history, after a coalition of Democrats broke from their party and voted with Republicans, in a move that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/chuck-schumer-resign-calls-shutdown-vote-democrats">has enraged</a> many in their caucus.</p>
<p>The vote passed in a 60-40 tally, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/10/government-shutdown-senate-vote">seven Democrats and one independent</a> joining all Republicans to approve a compromise deal that would fund most federal agencies through January. The agreement, which next goes to the House of Representatives, does not directly address the expiring tax credits for healthcare premiums, the issue at the center of the 40-day stalemate between Democrats and Republicans, though the Senate majority leader John Thune has promised a Senate vote later this year on the subsidies.</p>
