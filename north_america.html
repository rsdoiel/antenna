      <h1>An economic vocab lesson for the Trump era</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today we’re all getting smarter about some of the economic and political terms dominating the headlines these days. Terms like “authoritarianism” and “state capitalism” that have been hotly debated during the second Trump administration. Plus, “stagflation” and other vocabulary words our listeners have been curious about. With some help from experts, Kimberly breaks them all down.</p>

      <h1>Could airport slowdowns end the shutdown?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told the BBC that a serious market correction could come in the next six months to two years. He also hinted that there could be an imminent deal between India and the U.S. on tariffs; India is currently suffering under 50% duties. Also, China has tightened export controls on rare earth metals, which are vital to a range of electronic devices, including military hardware.</p>

Well experts haven’t just had a tough week of interpreting this economy — they’ve had a tough year. In this episode, the Trump administration’s policies have uniquely muddied traditional economic forecasting. Plus: Adjustable-rate mortgages grow in popularity, the food and beverage industry adapts to GLP-1 proliferation, and an American furniture manufacturer discusses Trump’s tariffs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <h1>The ACA subsides at the heart of the shutdown fight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Mark Anthony Dyson, author of the Job Scam Report newsletter, about how to spot scams.</p>

      <h1>On track for a layoffs record</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. is on track for the largest number of announced layoffs since 2020. Yay us! (Kidding.) We can thank a combination of federal cuts and their ripple effects, an uncertain trade environment, and AI experimentation. After that, Jenny Han of “The Summer I Turned Pretty” tells Kai about her career journey from nanny and school librarian to novelist and Amazon Prime showrunner. Plus: recession indicators, a federally-backed lithium mine and industrial outdoor storage.</p>

      <p>Messy fights over funding the federal government have become all too familiar in American politics. Why are we like this? On the show today, The Brookings Institution’s Molly Reynolds joins Kimberly to explain how shutdowns became Congress’ political weapon of choice and why the federal budget process has gotten even more complicated under the Trump administration.

      <h1>First came the shutdown, next the layoffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>Federal worker layoffs are near, according to Trump administration officials. Earlier this week, the president said he would use the government shutdown to target &quot;Democrat things.&quot; And a shutdown with layoffs may have more serious economic consequences than your average shutdown. For more on that we turn to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. Also on today's show: China launches a new visa to attract more international STEM talent.</p>

      <h1>As the labor market cools, job scams heat up</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>Unemployment remains relatively low, but the labor market is slowing down. Private payroll company ADP estimates the private sector lost 32,000 jobs last month. Hiring has slowed, and it's taking longer for jobseekers to find work. And where there are people with anxiety and fear, there are scammers to prey on them. The Federal Trade Commission says reports of job scams tripled over the past four years. But first, why the Trump administration is sending memos to universities and what Democrats are demanding to reopen the government.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Some European Union countries have backed plans for the new defense system to keep out unmanned aircraft from Russia. But how will it work, and what's the price tag? In France hundreds of thousands of workers have walked out over looming budget cuts and pension reforms. Today marks the 75th anniversary of The Turing Test, to tell the difference between a human and a machine. And we hear how Chilean businesses are adapting — or not — to an ageing workforce.</p>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The government shutdown means crucial jobs data will likely be postponed, right as the Fed weighs its next move. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a self-described “data dog,” tells us how central bank officials plan to pivot. He also discusses Fed independence, transitory inflation, and rate cut pacing. After that: fiscal calendars vary by sector, synthetic dye removal will ripple through the food chain, and ADP reports more sour employment data.</p>

      <p>Markets are having to digest a lot right now. There's the government shutdown, plus new private payroll data showing the economy lost jobs in September. Susan Schmidt, portfolio manager at Exchange Capital Resources, joins us to break it down. Also on the show: the FAFSA portal is open. We look at what's different with this year's federal student aid applications and how the government shutdown could impact the process.

      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry.

      <h1>Colleges turn to video essays to counter AI-written submissions</h1>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>Colleges and universities are dealing with a growing problem of college admission essays being written by artificial intelligence. Rather than try to figure out which essays are AI-generated, some schools are turning to an alternative approach: Have students submit a video instead.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Anne Kim, senior editor at Washington Monthly magazine who recently wrote about this new strategy that's gaining steam in higher education.</p>

      <h1>The housing market is "locked in"</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Pending home sales rose in August, boosted by a slight drop in mortgage rates. Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool. Also in this episode: Banks respond to the Fed rate cut, retailers prepare for holiday hiring, and tech companies hope nuclear is the answer to data center energy demand.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing a special bonus episode from “How We Survive.” It’s a conversation between host Amy Scott, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Elizabeth Kolbert. Together, they dig into how the climate crisis is triggering economic disruption. Plus, some solutions to be hopeful about.</p>
<p>And, we get a peek into Kolbert’s forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/781145/life-on-a-little-known-planet-by-elizabeth-kolbert/">”Life on a Little-Known Planet: Dispatches from a Changing World.”</a> In this collection of her most influential essays, Kolbert takes readers around the globe, telling stories about caterpillars, whale conversations and the people trying to preserve our planet.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded live, over Zoom, in front of an audience. You can watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5QiojlV640">here</a>. The event is presented by Odoo with additional underwriting support from The Economist.</p>

      <p>President Trump and congressional leaders are meeting at the White House on Monday to try and avoid a government shutdown. But both sides are digging their heels in. This brinksmanship is happening the same week we are set to get some pretty important government data. Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, and a professor at the University of Texas-Austin, joins us to talk about it.

      <p>Texas oil and gas firms are feeling pessimistic about the upcoming year. In the latest Dallas Fed survey, energy firms reported lower production, increased costs and heightened uncertainty. Oil is a good chunk of the Texas economy, and the Texas economy is a good chunk of the U.S. economy — around 9%.

      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban.

      <p>A lunch out may give you sticker shock, but a popping boba won't pop the budget, right? While some consumers are trying to be more money-conscious, many are still spending big on eating and drinking out. Chains like Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are all trying to cash in — in part by offering fancier, pricier, non-alcoholic drinks. Also on the program, we'll check in on New England's economy.</p>

      <p>Every fall for about three decades, the U.S. Department of Agriculture comes out with a report assessing food security across the country. We'll get the latest in a month, but it will be the last. The USDA is terminating the annual report, saying it was “politicized.” Researchers, however, say it was vital.

      <p>After being pulled by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned to TV last night. Thing is, station groups Nexstar and Sinclair — which control ABC affiliates that reach about 20% of the country — opted out. Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners. And later: If Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can’t reach a deal, many federal agencies will close a week from today.</p>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>Newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran has argued the federal funds rate should be a full two percentage points lower than its current level. A major cut like that could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs, spurring spending. But longer-term, inflation would likely balloon. After that: Auto dealers face new obstacles as EV tax credits end, a traveling nurse navigates frequent moves, and U.S. economic growth is “more resilient than expected,&quot; according to an OECD report.</p>

      <p>The newest member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors — close ally of President Donald Trump, Stephen Miran — made his case for more (and larger) interest rate cuts in a speech yesterday at the Economic Club of New York.

      <p>
      <p>There’s a race going on among tech firms — big and small — to join in the construction of what President Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome, a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Tens of billions of dollars in military contracts are at stake. In fact, the total cost might be in the trillions and the project could stretch a decade.</p>
<p>The technology and scale needed to make this all happen is, so far, largely unproven. And a whole host of tech firms are trying to show that they can help with the very complex undertaking. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sheera Frenkel, reporter at the New York Times, about some of the tech that would make this whole system work.</p>

      <h1>About that $100,000 H-1B visa fee</h1>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration is working to tamp down alarm over a new, $100,000 visa fee it announced on Friday. Technology, finance, and other major companies that depend on employees holding H-1B visas had initially thought the fee would be applied to existing visa holders, and those with H-1B workers who were temporarily abroad panicked. The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>

      <p>Stocks are on a winning streak. The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on Friday. Now, everything that goes up can go down, but there are some reasons to think the bulls may stick around for a while. We'll hear more. And later, Health Secretary Robert F.

      <p>
      <p>Here’s cautionary tale for you, out of China, about a young woman who says she fell in love with an artificial intelligence chatbot. There have been well-publicized instances of people seeking companionship from chatbots and it leading to tragedy. In this instance, it caused heartbreak. The story involves the Chinese AI firm Deepseek which, earlier this year, launched a chatbot that's almost as good as its American rivals. Soon after the launch, a young woman began a conversation with that chatbot. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak takes the story from there.</p>

      <p>There's a long list of actions the Trump administration has taken in this economy: calling for the removal of Intel's CEO, then purchasing a nearly 10% stake in that company; special exemptions to tariffs; calls on Walmart not to raise prices; and even telling Coca-Cola to use cane sugar and Cracker Barrel to keep its old logo. What can we make of all this? And what should we call it? Plus, economic predictions by Fed members are all over the map.</p>

      <h1>Anti-austerity strikes erupt across France</h1>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In France, 800,000 people are expected to participate in a day of protests and strikes across the country to rally against planned budget cuts. Plus, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva warns that steep U.S. tariffs on goods like coffee from his country will hit American consumers. And, the families of four passengers who died on the Air India jet crash in June are suing two companies they say are responsible.</p>

      <h1>The rise of the pro-AI PAC</h1>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
      <p>During the 2024 election, the cryptocurrency industry, including political action committees, accounted for nearly half of all of the corporate money going into the election, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen. That spending helped make Congress and the Trump administration more friendly to the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Now, in the run-up to the midterms, the AI industry wants to replicate the crypto sector’s success. AI companies are amassing millions of dollars to help candidates that favor light regulation over AI. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Amrith Ramkumar, a reporter at the Wall Street Journal who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/silicon-valley-launches-pro-ai-pacs-to-defend-industry-in-midterm-elections-287905b3">recently wrote about</a> this new pro-AI PAC network.</p>

      <h1>Why beef prices are higher than ever (and shoppers are finally resisting)</h1>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
