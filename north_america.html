      <p>Race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli is drawing attention as preview of 2026 midterms</p>
<p>After last year’s election, when Republicans made significant inroads in the state, New Jersey voters will cast ballots in an off-year, unpredictable gubernatorial race that voters and experts say feels different from any in recent memory.</p>
<p>Democrat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/mikie-sherrill-new-jersey-governor-democratic-primary">Mikie Sherrill</a>, a former navy pilot and federal prosecutor who represents New Jersey’s 11th congressional District, is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, who is making his third bid for governor, this time with Donald Trump’s endorsement.</p>

<p>When Clint Curtis was appointed to oversee voting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a>’s Shasta county earlier this year, the Florida-based lawyer and election skeptic pledged to “fix” the voting process.</p>
<p>Curtis had never before administered an election and didn’t live in this rural northern California region. But he was well-known to followers of the US election denialism movement, who believe the voting system is not secure and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> won the 2020 presidential election. Curtis, a former congressional candidate, described himself as an expert in elections law and had long argued that voting machines could be hacked and that the government could manipulate the results of elections.</p>

<p>Westwood is located in west Denver, a lower-income part of the city; median family income in the surrounding area is less than $43,000 a year, according to census data.</p>

<p>O’Brien has “no business being a labor leader” and “shouldn’t be trusted”, Richard Hooker Jr – who is running against O’Brien’s re-election next year – told the Guardian.</p>

      <p>San Antonio’s French phenom has led the Spurs to a franchise-best 5-0 start, announcing the dawn of basketball’s next dynasty</p>
<p>A spectre is haunting the NBA – the spectre of Victor Wembanyama.</p>
<p>All the powers of the old guard have entered into a tenuous alliance to contain this unicorn: rivals Luka Dončić and Anthony Edwards, the Oklahoma City radicals, and the one with the most to lose, Nikola Jokić. Everyone senses the shift, from the veterans of past champions to the new faces of the league. The Spurs are a basketball dynasty-in-waiting.</p>

      <p>Olympic champions Sifan Hassan and Eliud Kipchoge make their NYC debuts on Sunday, where rolling bridges, loud crowds and marathon chaos await</p>
<p>The New York City Marathon, like the city it takes over each fall, is as vast as it is vibrant; as loud as it is chaotic; and more than a little daunting, too.</p>
<p>No marathon is easy. But an air of unpredictability lingers over the five boroughs, with hopefuls humbled, and favorites frustrated, as they embark on a challenging 26.2-mile tour of the city.</p>

<p>After the Dodgers offense struggled in the first four games of the series, slashing just <a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/news/dodgers-offense-questions-world-series-game-6">.201/.296/.354</a> as a team, manager Dave Roberts shuffled his lineup ahead of Game 5. But it failed, as the Dodgers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/blue-jays-yesavage-dodgers-game-5-report-world-series">managed just four hits</a> and one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.</p>

      <h1>How the economy went "K-shaped"</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. economy is increasingly “K-shaped.” That means the gap between the wealthiest companies and consumers, and ... everyone else, is growing. Big Tech companies rake it in while smaller firms struggle. Similarly, the economy is increasingly dependent on the wealthiest consumers as everyone else pinches pennies. Economists warn these imbalances make the economy more fragile. Also in this episode: Farmers experiment with agrivoltaics, a Chicago tour guide showcases the city’s architectural history, and we recap the week's economic headlines.</p>

<p>US House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated this morning that he will not bring the chamber back into session until the government shutdown ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m4iico77ou2p">Speaking</a> to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government. Again, it’s the most fundamental responsibility of congress is to have the government operate and work for the people. That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”</p>

      <p>The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation measure, was supposed to be released today. But at day 31 of the government shutdown, it's nowhere to be found. This morning, we'll unpack what exactly we know about rising prices at a time of tariffs. And later, is 9 to 5 looking more like 7 to 7? We'll learn about the rise of the work trend known as &quot;microshifting.&quot;</p>

      <p>Bhuwan Pyakurel and Kamal Subedi’s story charts a Bhutanese refugee community’s rise – and its growing political divide</p>
<p>Almost 32 years ago, in a refugee camp in eastern Nepal, children sat cross-legged around a small blackboard propped on the dirt, repeating the alphabet in sing-song rhythm. Among them was Bhuwan Pyakurel, a fourth-grader, and his teacher, Kamal Subedi, barely 18.</p>
<p>“He was tall, thin, and very talkative,” Subedi said, now 52. “We didn’t know what would happen tomorrow. So we went hut to hut, gathering kids to learn.” In the early 1990s, <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/prm/policyissues/issues/protracted/countries/157400.htm">thousands of Bhutanese refugees had arrived across seven</a> camps in the region, each day bringing more families, more children, and more uncertainty.</p>

      <h1>‘He’s a true legend’: what now for Frankie Dettori as racing’s biggest name leaves the stage?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The last person who transcends the sport could make more headlines at the Breeders’ Cup</p>
<p>It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.</p>
<p>Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does. In a world that has been fragmented by social media and the internet, Dettori may well be the last racing figure who will ever enjoy such instant name-recognition across a broad swathe of the British population.</p>

      <h1>Move over, gender studies: the conservative tide coming for US universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>Deeming universities too leftwing, outside donors and state governments are sponsoring curricula that center the classics, Christianity and the ‘great books’ of western civilization</p>
<p>A small conservative revolution has swept the humanities at some US colleges and universities. Its vanguard are new programs, called centers or institutes, that have begun cropping up at schools in recent years. Often funded by outside donors or earmarks from state governments, the programs tend to bear names featuring words such as “civic”, “freedom” or “classical”.</p>
<p>These centers do credible teaching and research, and are usually not explicitly political. But their goal, to counter what conservatives see as hegemonically leftwing teaching, arguably is.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans">restrict the number of refugees</a> it admits into the US next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.</p>
<p><strong>What reason has been given for prioritizing white South Africans?</strong> The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law. The South African government has called the claims false.</p>
<p><strong>What was the other shooting by ICE agents in LA recently?</strong> Last week, federal agents shot an LA man who livestreams immigration enforcement operations on social media. Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following, had attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car.</p>

<p>The historic shifts in US immigration under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> have been dictated by a relentless voice over a telephone line: Stephen Miller, the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> czar, who in recent months has turned the state department’s visa and refugee operations into what some current and former diplomats have described as a personal fiefdom.</p>
<p>Each morning, usually at 10am, a small circle of conservative diplomats allied with Miller, including those who have assumed control of the state department’s consular and refugee operations, dial in for what some have termed the “Stephen Miller call”, an interagency discussion of immigration measures led by Miller, the White House’s homeland security adviser.</p>

<p>But each year at Halloween the police shut down the street as thousands of visitors flock to the area. It’s all due to two ageing brothers who spent 40 years working together in secret at a laboratory in the CIA.</p>

      <h1>My friend Pancho’s long life is a gift. Most racehorses never get that chance | Elizabeth Banicki</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>On Breeders’ Cup weekend the thoroughbred is celebrated. My aging friend reminds me that the same industry too often steals dignity from the young horses who run for our entertainment</p>
<p>My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.</p>
<p>As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Banicki <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/15/medina-spirit-scandal-horse-abuse-bob-baffert">worked for two decades</a> as an exercise rider in the horse racing industry.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson threw for 204 yards and four touchdowns, showing little rust in his return from a hamstring strain, and the Baltimore Ravens routed the Miami Dolphins 28-6 on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Jackson completed 18 of 23 passes in his first start since Week 4 against Kansas City, and the Ravens won their second straight as they attempt to make a run in <a href="https://www.nfl.com/standings/">the wide-open AFC North</a>. The Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3) top the division ahead of the Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals, who have 3-5 records. The Ravens <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/schedule/">have a favorable schedule</a> going forward, and will face only one team currently over .500 – the Steelers – in their next six games. They hope to become only the fifth team in NFL history to make the playoffs after losing five of their first six games.</p>

<p>The B.C.

The grand chief of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, Stewart Phillip, tells the CBC’s Michelle Eliot that the reaction to the Cowichan decision is a continuation of the historical mistreatment of Indigenous people in the province.</p>

<p>Mass killings continue to be reported in the Sudanese city of El Fasher after rebel forces took control on Sunday, ending an 18-month siege and sparking further alarm about a massive humanitarian crisis.</p>

      <h1>A one-year trade truce</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have pulled U.S.-China relations back from the brink. China says both sides will suspend plans to expand export controls — the U.S. on advanced tech and China on rare earths — and Trump will reduce tariffs on China’s exports by 10%. Plus, Meta stocks are down in the dumps, and the Netherlands is experiencing growing pains in the clean energy transition.</p>

      <h1>Breeders’ Cup 2025: all-conquering O’Brien arrives with sights on new record</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Ballydoyle squadron is at the heart of the European challenge in California this weekend</p>
<p>Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.</p>

      <p>US biotech viewed as lucrative target partly because of its promising pipeline of weight-loss drugs</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk has launched a surprise $9bn (£6.9bn) offer for the US obesity-focused biotech firm Metsera that could gazump an existing bid from Pfizer as the pharmaceutical giants fight for dominance in the weight-loss market.</p>
<p>The bid comes weeks after Metsera agreed to a $7.3bn takeover from the US group Pfizer. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, which owns the weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, lost out in a competitive auction processin September.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade">Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths</a> after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>What else was agreed?</strong> Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.</p>
<p><strong>Was Taiwan discussed?</strong> No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.</p>
<p><strong>When did the U</strong> <strong>S</strong> <strong>last hold a full nuclear weapons test?</strong> In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.</p>

      <p>If nothing changes before the weekend, most of the 42 million people on food stamps, or SNAP, will not get their November benefits as scheduled. The interruption for people who rely on SNAP to buy food would be significant but could also have broader ripple effects across the economy, as SNAP generates jobs, wages, and taxes. Also: the track record of past New York City rent freezes and the likelihood of future rate cuts this year.</p>

      <p>Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights</p>
<p>A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.</p>

      <h1>USWNT review: The kids are alright but concerns over chemistry and aerial ability remain</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The US started off badly with a loss to Portugal, recovered a bit with a win against the same team, and finished with a romp over New Zealand</p>
<p>More than three months after their last match, the US women’s national team returned to the pitch in October, playing three games with varied results. In the first, an impressive Portugal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/23/uswnt-portugal-friendly-alex-morgan-farewell">broke down the Americans</a> in a 2-1 win for the visitors. Emma Hayes played an almost entirely different, much younger lineup in the rematch, and the Americans returned the favor, 3-1. A somehow even younger lineup in the third game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/29/uswnt-emma-sears-hat-trick-new-zealand-friendly">steamrolled a limp New Zealand</a>, 6-0. The Portugal games offered many lessons; the Football Ferns were less scary than 11 jack-o’-lanterns would be, so that third match was more of a fun romp than a true test.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the window:</p>

      <p>
      <p>With ticket sales phases under way and prices reaching eye-watering levels, my experience raised a crucial question: who is this World Cup for?</p>
<p>For months, people in my life had been asking me when and where to get World Cup tickets. In the absence of any actionable information from Fifa before the first round of the pre-sale opened up, they hoped, I guess, that I had inside knowledge.</p>

Mind you, that was seven and a half years ago and an awful lot of inflation has happened since then. In the bid, Category 4 tickets for the group stage – the cheapest seats available – were priced at \)</span>21. (As we would soon learn, the actual price would start at $60, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/11/fifa-2026-world-cup-tickets-dynamic-pricing-nft-resale">category 4 tickets are almost non-existent</a>.)</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> At a long-anticipated meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea and discussed a possible truce in the trade war.

      <h1>Revealed: ICE violates its own policy by holding people in secretive rooms for days or weeks</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.</p>
<p>These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.</p>
<p>ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.</p>
<p>Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.</p>
<p>In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.</p>
<p>The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Quarterbacks such as Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield have gone from busts to MVP candidates. The Chargers backup is in the ideal place to make a similar journey</p>
<p>The development path for young NFL quarterbacks is brutal. They get lobbed in at the deep end as franchises try to figure out if their investment was worth it, before being tossed overboard if things go wrong. The league eats its young. The path from potential franchise starter to career backup – or out of the league – has never been shorter.</p>
<p>And that path has been expedited almost by design. In part, that’s due to the rookie pay scale, which allows teams to move on from perceived misfires early. It’s also down to a shift in evaluations. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson broke the mold for everyone. They redefined what a starting quarterback could look like, the skills needed, and the speed of development.</p>

      <h1>Nvidia: Boom or bubble?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Nvidia's market valuation surged to $5 trillion Wednesday, breaking records. The chipmaker is on fire, and it’s using its glut of resources to invest in other tech firms that need those chips. But if companies are using Nvidia money to buy Nvidia chips … should investors fret about a bubble? Also in this episode: We unpack Trump’s trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, more families skip paid child care altogether, and the Fed cuts rates for the second time this year.</p>

      <h1>Meta reports mixed financial results amid spree of AI hiring and spending</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Tech company brings in record quarterly revenue but major tax bill dampens earnings per share</p>
<p>Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025. The company brought in record quarterly revenue but reported a major tax bill that dampened earnings per share, the company announced on Wednesday. The financial results come as Meta ends a multibillion-dollar hiring spree focused on artificial intelligence talent.</p>
<p>The tech giant earned <span class="math inline">\(51.24bn in quarterly revenue, beating Wall Street expectations and the company’s own projections for third-quarter sales. However, it reported earnings per share (EPS) of \)</span>1.05, far below Wall Street expectations of <span class="math inline">\(6.70 in EPS. The major drop was due to a one-time non-cash income tax charge of \)</span>15.93bn. The EPS would have been $7.25 without this one-time charge, the company said.</p>

      <p>President’s effort to win $230m in damages from Mar-a-Lago and Russia investigations criticized as ‘frivolous’</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.</p>
<p>Trump has asked the justice department to pay him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html">$230m in damages</a>, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>In November 2015, in the midst of what was then considered a long-shot campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump released a book called Crippled America. In it, Trump set out his ideas about what was wrong with the US: immigrants, mostly, but also Barack Obama, the “often pathetic” media, and the “total losers” in Congress.</p>
<p>The book, the 18th in <a href="https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order">the Trump canon</a>, is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.</p>

<p>A top US military official has ordered the national guards of all 50 US states, the District of Columbia and US territories to form “quick reaction forces” trained in “riot control”, including use of batons, body shields, Tasers and pepper spray, according to an internal Pentagon directive reviewed by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The memo, signed on 8 October by Maj Gen Ronald Burkett, the director of operations for the Pentagon’s national guard bureau, sets thresholds for the size of the quick reaction force to be trained in each state, with most states required to train 500 national guard members, for a total of 23,500 troops nationwide.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinian students are threatening to sue George Mason University in Virginia after the school cited a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/23/antisemitism-redefinition-jewish-safety-christian-nationalism-democracy">contentious definition of antisemitism</a> it recently adopted to demand the removal of a social media post in which they described Israel as a “genocidal Zionist state” and the US as “the belly of the beast”.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the public university’s administrators on Wednesday, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter argued that the video amounted to “political expression on a matter of public concern, and thus the very speech the first amendment is meant to protect”.</p>

      <p>Researchers figure livestock herds contribute between 12% and 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's mostly methane from the digestive process. But a study from UC Davis finds that, when fed seaweed early on, cattle’s microbiome can be altered, reducing the amount of methane emissions. But first, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point — though they have limited data to go off of.</p>

<p>The 777X was central to Boeing’s long-term widebody strategy, previously dominated by its 747 and 777 jets. But repeated certification and production delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than $15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.</p>

      <h1>A potential pullback in auto lender oversight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Bankruptcies appear to be mounting in the subprime auto lending business. This all comes as auto loan delinquencies are rising, and the price of new and used cars stays stubbornly high. Amid all this, the Trump administration is quietly exploring a rollback of federal supervision of subprime auto lenders. Then, could federal law override state law that prevents medical debt from affecting your credit score? Plus, OpenAI goes from non-profit to for-profit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Correction (Oct. 29, 2025):</em></strong> <em>The introduction for the story about Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight of auto loan lenders in this episode contained an error that has been corrected. The threshold for which companies the CFPB can investigate involves how many loans those companies originate.</em></p>

      <p>Beijing is making it easier for global science and tech talent to visit or do business in China. Chinese officials opened a new K visa for graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to do research and start companies. This comes as the U.S. is cutting research grants and choking H-1B talent visas. Overseas, analysts say America’s loss could be China’s gain. But within China, there is a lot of anger over the K visa. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak explains from Shanghai.</p>

<p>Ahead of Thursday’s long-awaited first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/trump-and-xi-talks-what-will-be-on-the-agenda-when-us-president-meets-chinas-leader">meeting</a> between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping since the US president’s return to office, officials from both sides have been hammering out the contours of what a trade deal between Washington and Beijing might look like, an agreement that could bring an end to months of global economic chaos caused by the US-China trade war.</p>
<p>The two leaders have not met in person since 2019. Since then, the war in Ukraine and increasing concern in Washington about China’s technological advances, as well as longstanding issues about the imbalanced US-China trade relationship, have strained the bonds between the two superpowers.</p>

      <p>Analysis of public records comes as Trump administration aims to fast-track approval of new LNG export terminals</p>
<p>Every fully operational liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the US has violated federal pollution limits in recent years, a new report has found.</p>
<p>The analysis of public records comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is aiming to fast-track the approval of new export terminals in an attempt to sell more domestic LNG to Europe and Asia. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a> had previously placed a pause on LNG exports, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> lifted on the first day of his return to office.</p>

<p>A Toronto woman is sounding the alarm about Grok, Tesla's generative AI chatbot that was recently installed in Tesla vehicles in Canada. Farah Nasser says Grok asked her 12-year-old son to send it nude photos during an innocent conversation about soccer. Tesla and xAI didn't respond to CBC's questions about the interaction, sending what appeared to be an auto-generated response stating, &quot;Legacy media lies.&quot;</p>

<p>Bugonia refers to the ancient Greek belief that bees spontaneously formed from rotting ox carcasses — and it’s hard to avoid making connections to the plot and characters in Yorgos Lanthimos's new comedy: that while we want to believe something good, beautiful and ordered can spring from the depths of something dirty, polluted and diseased, it’s more likely a fairy tale.</p>

      <h1>US Senate passes bill with Republican support to rescind Trump’s tariffs on Brazil</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Republicans break ranks as vote passes 52-48 in rare bipartisan rebuke of US president’s trade policies</p>
<p>The US Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would terminate Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president’s trade war.</p>
<p>The legislation passed in a 52-48 vote, with five Republicans – senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky – joining all Democrats in favor. The vote took place on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/government-shutdown-senate-vote-fails">day 28</a> of the federal government shutdown with both sides at loggerheads over spending legislation.</p>

      <p>Amazon and Chegg both announced layoffs this week; Chegg says AI competition was a factor, and Amazon’s CEO alluded to AI-related job cuts earlier this year. History tells us when a new technology comes along and totally overhauls society (think, the steam engine), we end up with new, better jobs. So … why have we only heard about AI-related job elimination?

But first, Elon Musk has released an artificial intelligence-powered rival to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old says he played around with artificial intelligence tools in his first job and thought to himself: this technology is going to be a big deal.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Six NFL teams played in London this month. The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experience</p>
<p>It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving. Welcome to the International Series.</p>

      <p>Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office</p>
<p>US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a>’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. Nonetheless, Republicans maintained their findings cast doubt on Biden’s actions in office. And they sent a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, urging a full investigation – after Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/joe-biden-dismisses-donald-trump-inquiry-into-his-cognitive-decline-as-a-distraction">previously ordered a similar inquiry</a>.</p>

<p>Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on interest rates today. Most of the government data the Fed usually considers when voting on rates isn’t available because of the shutdown. We did get a tardy consumer price index report last Friday, though, and the Fed also produces some data itself. But can that paint a clear enough economic picture?

      <p>The former Raiders quarterback’s career was shortened by off-field issues. In his new book, he looks back at a complicated life</p>
<p>Marcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.</p>
<p>Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school. When Marinovich reached the NFL, it wasn’t just marijuana he was abusing.</p>

But his inclusion of alleged AI &quot;hallucinations&quot; as part of a self-represented bid to cut his property's assessed value in half may end up costing him money.</p>

      <h1>Freeman’s walk-off homer lifts Dodgers over Blue Jays in 18-inning World Series epic</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>Dodgers win in 18, tying longest World Series game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ohtani reaches base postseason-record nine times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.</p>
<p>When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.</p>

<p>The return to office last week by thousands of Ontario public servants has been &quot;disrespectful,”  “piecemeal” and filled with “unnecessary confusion,” say the workers' unions, who point out some ministries and agencies still don't have enough space to meet Premier Doug Ford’s order.</p>

      <h1>Trump says he would be allowed to run for third term as vice-president – video</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has given conflicting answers to whether he will attempt to run for a third term in 2028. At first he said he hadn't really thought about it, but then went on to say he would be allowed to run as vice-president in 2028 if he wanted to. When pressed by a reporter asking whether he would rule out running for a third term, he said cryptically: ‘I mean you'll have to tell me.’ Later in the interview, however, he said he would rule out running as vice-president, saying: 'I think it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that'</p>

      <p>President has not definitively ruled out seeking to extend time in office. Key US politics stories from Monday 27 October at a glance</p>

</ul>
<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the president has openly expressed interest in finding a way to stay in power beyond the two terms allowed in the US constitution. But his remarks on Monday provided more details into some MAGA minds’ thought process about how to pull it off.</p>

      <p>The federal shutdown is already having intense effects on unpaid federal workers. But we could be approaching a tipping point. In a memo, the USDA says about 42 million people will not get their SNAP benefits, starting Saturday. We'll hear more. Also, even if we don't get an inflation report, consumers are still pinched by rising prices. And, will Canada's transportation systems be ready for the FIFA World Cup next year?</p>

<p>The head of America’s largest federal workers union says it is time to end the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">government shutdown</a>, now the second-longest in US history, as hundreds of thousands of employees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/federal-workers-government-shutdown-pay-anxiety">miss another round of paychecks</a>.</p>
<p>Everett Kelley, who leads the American Federation of Government Employees representing more than 800,000 workers, avoided assigning blame to either party in the Monday morning letter but said lawmakers must stop playing politics and pass a stopgap funding measure to reopen the government, its closure now eclipsing the four-week mark.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.</p>
<p>“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">trade war truce</a> with the Chinese president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>Price increases are price increases, and consumers will bemoan inflation no matter the cause, right? Maybe not so much. Research shows that consumers tend to view inflation brought on by tariffs in a different light. Today, University of Chicago economist Alex Imas joins the program and uses behavioral economics to help make sense of it. But first, Louisiana will be building the first “rare earths separation facility” in the U.S.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p>
<p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p>
<p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p>

<p>The Canadian Environmental Law Association is recommending that all cities pass bylaws to make it mandatory for property owners to replace lead pipes on their side of the property line. Hamilton has a bylaw aimed at preventing partial lead service-line replacements, and some Quebec and Saskatchewan have similar rules. Here's what people in Thunder Bay, Ont., have to say about the idea as the city faces a $350-million class-action lawsuit.</p>

<p>Less than four years after being hired away from Notre Dame, Brian Kelly has been fired by LSU, the school’s athletic director, Scott Woodward, announced on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“When Coach Kelly arrived at LSU four years ago, we had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge,” Woodward said. “Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize.”</p>

      <h1>President Trump axes trade talks with Canada</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

Plus, we learned this week that Amazon may be planning to expand its use of robots and shrink its use of humans at its warehouses. And this week's disruptive outage at Amazon Web Services reminded us of just how much we depend on cloud computing, even for a good night's sleep. Marketplace’s Nova Safo discussed all of this with Jewel Burks Solomon, managing partner at the venture firm Collab Capital, for this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>The arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gambling</p>
<p>The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.</p>
<p>Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims">were arrested Thursday</a> in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james">who allegedly provided</a> “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has canceled plans for a deployment of federal troops to San Francisco that had sparked widespread condemnation from California leaders and sent protestors flooding into the streets. The Bay Area region had been on edge after reports emerged the Trump administration was poised to send more than 100 Customs and Border Protection and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city in the East Bay, as part of a large-scale immigration-enforcement plan. It prompted hundreds of protesters to mobilize outside the Coast Guard base</p>

      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

      <h1>'Stupid political stunt': Vance criticises Knesset vote to annex West Bank – video</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>US vice-president has criticised Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling the move a 'stupid political stunt' after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv’s international airport before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, JD Vance insisted that 'the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren't happy about it,' adding:'I personally take some insult to it'</p>

      <p>
      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

      <h1>Parsing the impact of fresh U.S. sanctions on Russian oil</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

Later in this episode: AI firms juice the stock market, an economist explains Trump’s flavor of state capitalism, and sports betting sites push the boundary between state and federal regulation.</p>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Netflix is trying a new strategy to make more money: It's worked out a deal to stream some podcasts from Spotify, which have both audio and video. The deal means access to more consumer data and a new audience. And it's a move against a common competitor: YouTube. Also on the show: a change in tune on crytpo from a Federal Reserve leader and OpenAI's very own web browser.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Experts have estimated that the cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover — which halted car production there for multiple weeks — cost the carmaker roughly $2.55 billion, making the breach the most expensive in the country’s history. We'll do the numbers. And later in the program, tourism has long played a central part in Cuba’s economy. So what impact have the Trump administration’s new sanctions had?</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for tribal nations — as a force multiplier for hard-to-staff departments, a tool to better serve tribal citizens, and even to aid in the revitalization of Indigenous languages and culture.</p>
<p>But, as with all applications of AI tools, data security concerns loom. And some nations are adopting the new technology quicker than others. For an overview, Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Savannah Peters, who covers Indigenous communities for Marketplace.</p>

Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled. Also on the show: collective bargaining rights for Uber and Lyft drivers in California and a U.S.-Australia alliance concerning rare earth metals.</p>

      <h1>Call it a silver squeeze</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Silver hit an all-time high last week. Helping fuel that rally is a physical shortage; global demand for silver has been outstripping supply since 2020. We'll hear about the supply of silver, which has more industrial uses than its flashier cousin, gold. Also, a Brazilian oil giant will start drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River. And coming soon to a convenience store near you: individual mini Coke cans.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high. But the conservative leader, who models herself after former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will have to tackle a range of economic challenges: a falling population, a rise in the cost of living, and sluggish growth. Plus, a federal green tech funding pullback in the U.S. is hitting Vice President JD Vance’s hometown.</p>

Plus: Recruiters give mixed takes on the job market, oil services companies are up against low prices and a supply glut, and streaming platforms set their sights on video games and podcasts.</p>

      <p>Agriculture is notoriously susceptible to the whims of the elements. Farmers and ranchers can see their entire livelihoods turn on one bad hailstorm or ill-timed heat wave, which are more frequent as our planet continues to warm. Today, we'll head to Colorado to hear about an apprenticeship program that's embedding climate literacy into its teachings. But first: the value of the dollar, this morning's web outages, and pain for small- and mid-sized businesses.</p>

      <h1>New CA law requires Uber and Lyft to bargain with drivers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>California has enacted a law requiring rideshare giants Uber and Lyft to collectively bargain with their drivers. Because the drivers are technically independent contractors, they otherwise would not have federally-protected labor rights like full-time employees. The new state law could be a game changer.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Levi Sumagaysay, reporter at CalMatters, who helps sift through the details of the law.</p>

(date: 2025-10-17)
      <p>
      <p>Two midsize U.S. lenders claimed they were victims of loan fraud this week, sending bank stocks into a tailspin. But by close Friday, markets evened out — and for good reason: Regional banks, overall, are actually doing well. In this episode, we dispel the midsize bank sector doomsayers. Plus: Rising auto loan delinquencies could be a consumer debt canary in the coal mine, American culinary sensibilities have moved beyond “foodie” culture, and goats are the star employees in one family's landscaping business.</p>

      <p>Rates on 30-year mortgages fell again this week to an average of 6.27%, according to FreddieMac. That could boost consumer spending on home improvements in 2026, new research finds — and be driven by homeowners locked in with lower rates who recognize that an addition or coat of paint is less daunting than starting over in this housing market.

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. retail and supply chain sectors are slowing down — September’s Logistics Managers’ Index hits its lowest point since March. Many retailers are stopping shipments after stocking up early to avoid tariffs. Ongoing trade uncertainty and rising costs have companies fretting about the long term. Also in this episode: Gen Z plans to spend less this holiday season, tariffs muddle international library lending, and Colorado colleges partner with the private sector to expand skilled jobs training.</p>

      <p>It’s a big week for bank earnings. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported quarterly results on Tuesday; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag. We'll unpack. Also on the show: a major cryptocurrency scam and the economics of Broadway contract negotiations.</p>

Today, Mokyr joins the program to discuss how major technological changes can boost economic growth — that is, if politics and institutions can adapt quickly enough. Plus, why the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings are raising questions about private credit markets and big banks’ exposure to them.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab.

      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

      <h1>Contractors hit hard by government shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Chief executives have been urged to plan for computer security breaches by going back to pen and paper. The U.K. government told CEOs to plan offline contingencies after a number of high-profile attacks on companies — hacks that cost global brands millions of dollars. We'll learn more. Plus, delegates are in London for U.N. talks aimed at reducing the environmental impact of global shipping. And, we'll hear about the impact of tariffs on Swiss businesses.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>
