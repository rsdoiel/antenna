      <h1>"The president has just made us a higher-risk country"</h1>

      <p>
      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan and Australia are among the latest countries suspending some postal deliveries to the United States. And it's all down to confusion over tariffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month ending the global import tax exemption on small packages worth under $800 entering the U.S. duty-free, a change due to take effect on Friday. Also, Boeing and Korean Air have announced a deal worth $36 billion for over 100 planes.</p>

      <p>President Trump's recent deal with Intel gives the U.S. government a 10% ownership stake in the company. But today, Intel responded with a regulatory filing, outlining all of the ways this deal could go sideways. We take a look at the unintended consequences of governments owning companies. Also on the show: why prices have been slow to rise in response to tariffs and what to expect from the fall retail season.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>After celebratory markets late last week following indications that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at its September meeting, this week is starting with a bit of a headache. Markets are eager for a rate cut, but signs of a weaker labor market and uncertainty from tariff and immigration policy are complicating the economic picture. Then, Australia is hoping to ease the rare earths bottleneck after China said it's tightening controls on mining and processing.</p>

      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip?

      <p>The fashion world has the Met Gala. The movies have the Oscars. Central banking has an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech, where economists will be listening for clues on interest rates. But there’s another pressing issue looming over Powell’s speech: a new five-year framework for the Fed's interest rate strategy. We have an explainer. Plus, there's new evidence that first-time homebuyers remain undeterred.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A trade agreement between the United States and the European Union means that U.S. tariffs on imported European goods will be significantly lower than previously thought. The U.S. will cap tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors at 15%. That's a huge decrease from prior threats of levies as high as 250%. Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The prestigious Santa Fe Indian Market draws over 1,000 Indigenous artists from more than 200 tribal nations each year, including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis artists from Canada. But this year, economic policies from the Trump administration have complicated things for those traveling from north of the border. We'll chat with a few artists. Also on the show: India and China will restart direct flights, and mortgage rates dip, but not enough to boost demand.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the struggling U.S. chipmaker Intel. The arrangement would be unusual but not unprecedented. And Intel was already getting a federal grant under the CHIPS and Science Act, approved during the Biden administration. Also on the show: a dispatch from the annual World AI Conference in Shanghai and a look at the pluses and minuses of retailers using third-party vendors.</p>

It comes at a time when the industry is struggling with studio layoffs, increased competition in a crowded market, and rising costs. Plus, a centuries-old church in Sweden has begun a slow-motion journey to make way for the expansion of the world's deepest iron ore mine.</p>

      <p>In this uncertain economy, employers want to save where they can. That’s likely why Starbucks just joined a growing list of companies to shift from merit-based raises to a flat percentage raise. In this episode, why a flat raise structure tends to be cheaper and less time consuming than merit increases — even though everyone gets ‘em. Plus: China leans into trade with developing nations, President Trump wants to cut funding for flights to rural airports, and homebuilder sentiment stays low.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Consumer spending was up pretty significantly for more expensive items last month — things like cars and furniture. All that big-ticket buying comes despite a softening labor market and broader economic uncertainty. We'll parse the data a bit more. Also on the program: we'll hear what we can expect from homebuilder confidence and learn how the startup world is grappling with tariffs and the cancellation of government grants and contracts.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A court in Australia has handed the airline Qantas a record fine — just under $59 million USD — for illegally laying off 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. And later, could plans for sweeping tax cuts on consumer goods boost India’s economy in the face of U.S. tariffs? Plus, the root vegetable cassava is one of the world's most versatile crops. We'll hear more about Nigeria's cassava market.</p>

      <p>
      Electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation.  That's especially costly during the dog days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.  In addition to hot weather, a variety of factors are causing power bills to climb, including the high cost of natural gas used to generate electricity and soaring demand from data centers.

And those new, higher prices aren’t going away.<br><br>At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down. And yet, our fears or feelings that things will spiral out of control again? Those have not slowed down.<br><br>This mismatch has been giving us all the... feelings. Inflation feelings.

      <p>President Trump reportedly has floated a plan that would have the U.S. government take partial control of Intel, the ailing chipmaking giant. We look at how a potential deal might shake out and what obstacles it could face. Then, on the other side of the Pacific, workers at Chinese AI companies are working long hours in the heated global AI race. And finally, the BBC’s Jane Chambers reports on the economic malaise in Bolivia that’s shaping this weekend’s elections. </p>

      <p>Earlier this week, the July CPI report showed consumer prices remained steady, despite tariff noise. Today’s producer price index tells a different story: Wholesale prices grew a whopping 3.3% year-over-year. When might retailers pass those higher costs on to consumers? We break it down. Plus: Automated applications sow pessimism among job hunters, New York City marks two months of a ban on tenant-paid broker fees, and U.S. oil refineries face regionally different outlooks.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month, claiming that the monthly jobs numbers — which were revised downward — were “rigged” to make him look bad. Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare? Also: a flare of inflation at the wholesale level and a comeback for adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>

      <p>In addition to the many considerations surrounding cost, those who lost homes in this year's California wildfires may also be looking for an environmentally-friendly way to rebuild that's able to withstand the next fire. Today, Marketplace's David Brancaccio explores mass timber, which doesn't burn easily, as an option for home reconstruction. But first, New York’s attorney general is suing the company that runs Zelle, alleging its customers were left open to fraud.</p>

Today on the show, what is fueling the celebrity business bonanza?

      <p>HBO Max’s “Hacks” often tackles the push and pull between art and profit in the entertainment industry. It’s a topic the show’s creators are deeply familiar with. In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal discusses that tension — as it appears in the show and in real life — with “Hacks” showrunners Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Plus: Job-finding sites struggle as hiring slows, and response rates to government surveys fall.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <h1>Is there a cost if economists face pressure to back up Trump?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Recently, President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after revisions depicted a weaker job market than initially thought. This week, Trump called on the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get rid of his chief economist, after the economist predicted that tariffs would force consumers to pay extra. What should consumers and investors make of this? We'll discuss. And later, we'll hear how French factories are benefiting from increased defense spending.</p>

      <p>Social Security turns 90 tomorrow. Some 74 million Americans receive the benefits, and a new survey shows that 65% of retirees rely on them. Roughly 40% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and this precarity comes at a time when Social Security faces the possibility of benefit cuts. Plus, Trump's tariffs are generating billions in revenue monthly, and Brazil's president announced $5 billion to help smaller companies deal with tariffs.</p>

      In economics, a market is a place (even virtual) where buyers and sellers interact to exchange goods or services.  Economists love markets. It's like all of our supply and demand graphs have come to life. Everything you buy goes through some sort of marketplace—your cup of coffee came from trading in the bean markets. Your spouse might have come from the dating marketplace on the apps. Even kids will tell you one Snickers is worth at least two Twix. <br><br>But sometimes, as we'll see today, markets can go terribly wrong; greed can run out of control; lives can be at risk. That's when the government often steps in and gives the market a little nudge to work better. <br><br>Today's episode: Market Design. <br><br><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@planetmoney/video/7390045174518254891">Check out our Summer School video cheat sheet on the origins of money at the Planet Money TikTok.</a> <br><br><em>The series is hosted by Robert Smith and produced by Eric Mennel.

      <p>Ever read past the top line of the consumer price index? That 2.7% inflation rate varies a lot by metro area. The same goes for goods categories. So why is inflation higher in San Diego than Dallas? And higher for baby clothes and than electronics? We explain. Also in this episode: Long-term unemployment rises as hiring slows, businesses grow weary of waiting for tariff clarity, and we talk to Cheryl McKissack Daniel, CEO of the country's largest Black-owned construction firm.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Today we’re diving into some ongoing battles over athlete pay, from college athletics to the WNBA. In the case of college sports, a recent lawsuit settlement involving the NCAA allows colleges and universities to pay their athletes directly. On the show today, sports journalist Kennington Lloyd Smith III explains how college athlete pay has evolved, how the recent House v. NCAA settlement could strain athletic departments, and what could come from the WNBA players’ current fight for more equitable pay.

      <h1>Who's gonna take out the trash?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Philadelphia, Boston, and Seattle have all experienced strikes by trash collection workers this summer. At their peak, more than 2,000 workers coast to coast walked off the job after contract talks stalled. The Teamsters Union representing the workers says members deserve a pay rise and better health care benefits. We'll hear from the picket line and customers affected. But first, a Texas-based manufacturer reflects on what all this tariff back-and-forth means for business.</p>

      Cutting Medicaid can seem like an easy way to slash the budget. But, the costs can spread to all of us.

      Inflation remained elevated last month as President Trump's tariffs continued to make their way into the prices that consumers pay. The average cost of living in July was up 2.7%.

      <p>
      <p>Each year, pediatricians order vaccines in anticipation of the winter respiratory virus season. But plummeting demand and confusion over vaccine recommendations have thrown the process into chaos, forcing some doctors to gamble and order vaccines they may not be able to use. We'll hear more. But first, the White House has again extended its trade truce with China, and the president's tariffs hit toy stores, which buy most of their products overseas.</p>

       As regulators crack down on noncompete agreements, employers are turning to TRAP contracts to lock workers into their jobs.

      <h1>U.S. and China extend trade truce</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/12/us-and-china-extend-trade-truce">Marketplace Morning Report</a>)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It came right down to the wire, but the U.S. and China have extended their trade truce until November. This means those massive American tariff hikes — some as high as 145% — have been put on hold, as Beijing was ready to hit back with 125% tariffs. But could another 90 days be enough time to strike a deal? Plus, this summer, several U.S. cities have been gripped by trash collection strikes. We'll hear more.</p>
