At Marketplace, it’s our job to explain how marketplaces work. This
week, we’re turning from traditional stock and financial markets to the
in-person kind. For the final installment of
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/marketplace-morning-report-tricks-of-the-trade/">our
new “Tricks of the Trade” series</a>, we learn how to hunt for the best

<strong>1. Leading climate advocates call for overhaul of COP
process</strong>

<p>
Some of the leading voices on global climate science and policy have
called for a fundamental overhaul of the COP process, saying the current
structure “simply cannot deliver the change” at the exponential speed
and scale that is necessary.

Stiell, is signed by 22 prominent researchers, advocates, and
policymakers including former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana
Figueres, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and Director of the
Potsdam Institute for Climate Action Research Johan Rockström. In short,
the letter calls for less talk and more action, recommending the
following measures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Climate COP host countries must support the energy transition.
</li>
<li>
COP meetings must be smaller and more frequent, “where countries report
on progress, are held accountable in line with the latest science.”
</li>
<li>
Countries must be held to account for their climate commitments through
better reporting, benchmarking, and tracking mechanisms.
</li>
<li>
A clear definition of climate finance must be issued, “along with common
reporting frameworks and tracking mechanisms to verify climate financing
flows.”
</li>
<li>
COP should have its own permanent scientific advisory body.
</li>
<li>
Negotiations should consider the interconnected issues of nature loss,
inequality, and poverty.
</li>
<li>
Stop the flood of fossil fuel lobbyists at climate COPs, and ensure
equitable representation from other parties like scientists and
Indigenous communities.
</li>

$32.3 million in Series A funding. The company, which launched just last
year, removes carbon by locking it away in organic waste (like
biosolids, food, or manure) that it buries underground using already
existing well infrastructure. So far Vaulted Deep has issued more than
7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal, which it claims is “the
industry’s fastest and highest rate of deliveries in the first year of
operations for durable CDR.” The company plans to use the new funding to
develop new wells and grow its CDR capabilities. Earlier this year the
decarbonization coalition Frontier facilitated $58 million in offtake
agreements with the startup to remove 152,480 tons of CO2 by 2027.

China, India, Iran, Vietnam, and Brazil saw some of the biggest

Japan, South Korea coordinate response to North Korean threats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with leaders of South Korea and
Japan Friday to come up with a “coordinated” response to the deployment
of thousands of North Korean troops to help Moscow’s war against Ukraine
and on Pyongyang’s nuclear threat more broadly, on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>Pyongyang’s troop deployment is a “significant development,” White
House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air
Force One en route to Lima, Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We are going to treat it with the seriousness with which it deserves
to be treated,” he said.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the trilateral summit will allow leaders to prepare for
any potential “provocative” move from Pyongyang, including nuclear
testing and ballistic missile launches, as the U.S. prepares for a
change of administration when Donald Trump takes office in January.</p>
<p>“Transitions have historically been time periods when the DPRK has
taken provocative actions,” Sullivan said, using the abbreviation for
North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea.</p>
<p>The United States has an “extended deterrence” policy that aims to
prevent adversaries from attacking allies, including South Korea and
Japan. The policy states Washington will come to their aid if they are
attacked, potentially including use of American nuclear
capabilities.</p>
<p>No specific announcement on extended deterrence will be announced at
a trilateral level in Lima, Sullivan said. However, the trilateral
meeting will be an opportunity to “ensure that each of these two
bilateral dialogues are working to reinforce one another, and that there
aren’t gaps and seams between them.”</p>
<p>The leaders are set to announce establishment of a trilateral
secretariat as part of their efforts to “institutionalize” three-way
cooperation that began as a series of leaders’ dialogues on economic
security, intelligence sharing, and defense policy coordination. The
trilateral leaders’ dialogues began in May 2023 on the sidelines of the
G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and then at Camp David in August that
year.</p>
<p>The trilateral effort is one of Biden’s signature regional security
initiatives to push Seoul and Tokyo to overcome years of animosity and
work together to deter common adversaries, North Korea and China.</p>
<p>The leaders are also set to bolster trilateral exercises, Sullivan
said.</p>
<p>“We’ve made progress on technology protection, on supply chain
diversification, on missile warning and the sharing of data with respect
to miswarning in all of those areas,” he said. “We expect to take
further steps tomorrow.”</p>
<p>U.S., Japanese and South Korean militaries Thursday launched joint
exercises in waters south of the Korean peninsula and west of Japan, the
final drills under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>During his first term Trump advocated for friendlier ties with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un and pressured Tokyo and Seoul to take on a
larger share of U.S. defense burden-sharing.</p>
<p>A day before Trump’s reelection, the U.S. and South Korea a finalized
a new agreement for Seoul to pay $1.19 billion in 2026 to support U.S.
troops, an 8.3% increase from the previous year.</p>

id="can-trumps-return-to-white-house-be-an-opportunity-for-enhancing-us-turkey-ties">Can
Trump’s return to White House be an opportunity for enhancing US-Turkey
ties?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was among the
first foreign leaders to congratulate U.S. President-elect Donald Trump
on his early November election victory.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has not hosted Erdogan at the White House though
the two have met on sidelines of international summits and spoken by
phone.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists accompanying his return from visits to Saudi
Arabia and Azerbaijan, Erdogan expressed his hope for improved U.S.
ties, adding, however, that in-person meetings would be needed to
achieve that end, and that Ankara needs to wait to see what kind of a
Cabinet Trump forms.</p>
<p>The two leaders had a close personal relationship during Trump’s
first term in office. However, bilateral relations have also been marked
by tough times during that administration. With Trump’s January return
to the White House, analysts told VOA that although there may be
opportunities for more cooperation in some areas, they don’t expect
major changes.</p>
<p>James Jeffrey, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Turkey from 2008
to 2010, sees Ukraine as one area with potential for cooperation.</p>
<p>Referring to Trump’s promise to end the war in Ukraine, Jeffrey says
Turkey could play a role in negotiating a cease-fire, making both sides
“well-aligned for a productive relationship.”</p>
<p>Alan Makovsky, a senior fellow for national security and
international policy at the Center for American Progress, also believes
Trump’s priority to end the war in Ukraine creates a significant
opportunity for Erdogan.</p>
<p>A NATO ally, Turkey has adopted a careful balancing act amid the war
in Ukraine, supplying armed drones to Ukraine while maintaining ties
with Russia in energy and tourism.</p>
<p>Erdogan, who has maintained good relations with both Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, has
long said neither side is gaining from the war and offered to host and
mediate negotiations.</p>
<p>Disagreement over Syria</p>
<p>Disagreements between Turkey and the United States during Trump’s
first term included Ankara’s frustration with U.S. support for Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF) led by Kurdish militia — People’s Protection
Units, known as YPG in northern Syria.</p>
<p>After a phone call with Erdogan on October 6, 2019, Trump
unexpectedly announced that the U.S. would withdraw from Syria. Many
U.S. military officials, all of whom were caught off guard by the
announcement, did not support the idea.</p>
<p>Tension between the allies worsened after Trump on October 9 sent a
letter to Erdogan, warning him against a military incursion into
Syria.</p>
<p>Following Trump’s withdrawal announcement, Turkey launched a military
operation in northern Syria targeting the YPG on October 9.</p>
<p>A cease-fire agreement was reached during then-Vice President Mike
Pence’s visit to Ankara on October 17.</p>
<p>Now, some in Ankara expect the U.S. may reconsider its presence in
northern Syria during Trump’s second term.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, a U.S. envoy for Syria from 2018 to 2020, suggests Trump’s
administration may reassess this issue.</p>
<p>“Each time people were able to convince [Trump on Syria, it] was that
the troops were serving a set of important purposes. This is one of the
most low-cost, high-return military deployments. We are keeping the
Islamic State under control. Secondly, we are holding vital terrain,
blocking Iranian, Assad and Russian ambitions,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Washington has long said its SDF partnership is necessary for the
enduring defeat of ISIS and countering Iran.</p>
<p>Ankara considers YPG a Syrian offshoot of PKK, which U.S. officials
have also designated as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Trump nominated Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, for
secretary of state. Rubio was one of the strongest opponents of a
U.S.-pullout from Syria at the time.</p>
<p>He labeled the decision as “a catastrophic mistake that will have
dire consequences far beyond Syria,” urging Trump to reconsider it.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to see how that works out and how Marco Rubio’s views may
have changed to accord more with Trump’s or vice versa,” Makovksy said.
“But anyone who thought that Trump’s election meant that the U.S. would
soon be withdrawing from Syria would certainly have to rethink that view
in light of the Rubio appointment. I think that makes it unlikely that
we will withdraw from Syria.”</p>
<p>Trump’s nominees for Cabinet positions will require Senate approval
before they assume office.</p>
<p>F-35 program</p>
<p>One complicating factor in U.S.-Turkey relations during Trump’s first
term was Turkey’s purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from
Russia, which prompted Washington to remove Ankara from an F-35 joint
strike fighter program.</p>
<p>“The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection
platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities,”
said a White House statement when the system was delivered in July 2019,
explaining the U.S. decision to remove Turkey from the project.</p>
<p>The Trump administration in December 2020 sanctioned Turkey under the
Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).</p>
<p>Turkey, which has since requested removal of CAATSA sanctions, has
returned to talks with U.S. officials about a possible return to the
F-35 program.</p>
<p>Analysts say that while there is a likelihood that CAATSA sanctions
might be lifted during Trump’s second term, any solution to the S-400
issue that is not permanent would not be technically acceptable to the
U.S. military.</p>
<p>Describing the F-35s as the U.S. military’s largest project since
World War II, Jeffrey said, “A permanent solution is that they [the
S-400s] go away, they’re sold to somebody else. I would like to have a
solution, but technically, I don’t think there is one.’’</p>
<p>Makovsky called Turkey’s return to the F-35 program unlikely in the
near term.</p>
<p>“If they completely get rid of the S-400s, really give up possession
as the law requires, there could be a reasonable chance for F-35,” he
told VOA. “But it will be up to the so-called Four Corners - the
chairman and senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.”</p>

<p>
Over the course of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump made a lot
of promises. What does that mean for the years ahead? Today we’re
answering your questions about Trump’s second term. We’ll explain
whether the Trump administration could actually eliminate the Department
of Education, how income tax cuts for tips and overtime pay could impact
the economy, and where the Biden administration’s student debt relief
plans go from here. Plus, if not tariffs, then what?

id="wisconsin-agency-issues-permits-for-enbridge-line-5-reroute-around-reservation">Wisconsin
agency issues permits for Enbridge Line 5 reroute around
reservation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MADISON, Wisconsin — Enbridge’s contentious plan to reroute an aging
pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to
reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state
regulators.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they
have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad
River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation. The energy company
still needs discharge permits from the DNR and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.</p>
<p>The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the
pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain
rerouting construction will damage the region’s watershed and perpetuate
the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Permits issued with conditions</p>
<p>The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions
attached. The company must complete the project by November 14, 2027,
hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to
access the site during reasonable hours.</p>
<p>The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit
violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways;
can’t discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive
areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points;
and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant
species.</p>
<p>Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling
it a “major step” toward construction that will keep reliable energy
flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday
that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that
would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe’s wild
rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality
violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline’s
construction in northern Minnesota.</p>
<p>“I’m angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that
spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,” Bad River
Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. “We will continue
sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from
endangering our watershed.”</p>
<p>Tribe sues in 2019</p>
<p>Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters)
of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan
to Sarnia, Ontario. About 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the pipeline run
across the Bad River reservation.</p>
<p>The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the
pipeline from the reservation, arguing that the 71-year-old line is
prone to a catastrophic spill and that land easements allowing Enbridge
to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.</p>
<p>Enbridge has proposed a 66-kilometer (41-mile) reroute around the
reservation’s southern border.</p>
<p>The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S.
District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down
the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and
pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal
is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago.</p>
<p>Michigan’s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit
in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath
the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan
and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the
line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in
a federal appellate court.</p>
<p>Michigan regulators in December approved the company’s $500 million
plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a
tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers.</p>

id="china-tries-to-smooth-ties-with-eu-as-it-anticipates-shift-in-us-foreign-policy">China
tries to smooth ties with EU as it anticipates shift in US foreign
policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan  — China is ramping up efforts to smooth ties with the
European Union in the wake of the U.S. elections, with a top Chinese
official and state media maintaining that improved ties are in the
interest of both Brussels and Beijing. </p>
<p>As countries worldwide try to anticipate what President-elect Donald
Trump’s victory might mean for U.S. foreign policy, analysts say the
push by Beijing appears aimed at driving a wedge between the EU and the
United States.     </p>
<p>“Beijing is trying to exploit current uncertainty regarding the
future of transatlantic relations to ensure that the EU distances itself
from Washington’s increasingly confrontational approach toward China,
but it will be difficult [for Beijing] to accomplish [the task,]” said
Alicja Bachulska, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the European
Council on Foreign Relations.    </p>
<p>“Europe is becoming increasingly aware of the negative impact of
China’s foreign and industrial policy on the single market and the
security of NATO’s Eastern flank,” she told VOA in a written response.
   </p>
<p>On November 9, the deputy head of European affairs at the Chinese
Foreign Ministry, Cao Lei, said that because Trump’s victory could be
“the turning point of our times,” the EU and China should repair
divisions and improve bilateral relations.    </p>
<p>“No one wants to return to the law of the jungle, no one wants to go
back to the era of confrontation and the Cold War, and no one wants to
return to unilateral hegemony. This is the backdrop that China-EU
relations are facing,” he said at the launch of the China Think-Tank
Network on Europe at Beijing Foreign Studies University. </p>
<p>Tension rises</p>
<p>Some Chinese analysts say the two should restore trust because Europe
is more important for China than the United States.  </p>
<p>“With Trump returning to the White House, an enhanced China-Europe
cooperation will be beneficial for both sides to address [challenges] at
the onset of a new era of uncertainties in the world,” Feng Zhongping,
the head of European studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
a Chinese government-affiliated think tank, said at the same event.
 </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chinese state media outlets are urging the EU to adopt a
“pragmatic approach” to cooperating with China after the bloc decided to
increase tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China to as much as
45.3% in October.  </p>
<p>“A hardline economic and trade policy stance toward China will only
further restrict the EU’s maneuvering space in economic cooperation,
which will, in turn, exacerbate the EU’s economic difficulties,” China’s
state-run tabloid Global Times wrote in an opinion piece on
Wednesday. </p>
<p>Those remarks come amid rising trade tension between China and the
EU. In response to the bloc’s tariffs against Chinese EVs, China
announced Monday that it will start imposing temporary anti-dumping
measures against imported European brandies on November 15.</p>
<p>While the EU and China both claim to have made some progress in the
ongoing negotiation to address the EV tariffs last week, Bloomberg
reported on Monday that the bloc sees little prospect of a quick
deal.</p>
<p>Experts say while China hopes to stabilize trade relations with the
EU as it prepares for potential tariffs that Trump has vowed to impose
on Chinese products once he takes office, Brussels is unlikely to halt
its efforts to rebalance trade relations with China.  </p>
<p>“What Beijing could potentially expect is to see its
divide-and-conquer approach slow down the EU’s efforts to implement
relevant economic defensive instruments,” Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an
expert on EU-China relations at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan,
told VOA by phone.    </p>
<p>Some European leaders also are becoming more critical of China’s
close partnership with Russia. Kaja Kallas, the incoming foreign policy
chief for the EU, said Beijing should pay “a higher price” for
supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Without China’s support to Russia, Russia would not be able to
continue its war with the same force. China needs to also feel a higher
cost,” Kallas said during a hearing at the European Parliament on
Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Bachulska said Kallas’ comments reflect the growing realization
across Europe that “China is a strategic enabler of Russia,” but the
sense of urgency is not evenly distributed across EU member states.
 </p>
<p>“Some actors are convinced that Beijing should not be further
‘antagonized’ and that China’s geographic distance from Europe makes it
less of a threat,” she told VOA, adding that Beijing will try to exploit
this narrative.  </p>
<p>Other experts add that with the security threat posed by Russia,
European countries will likely put more effort into maintaining their
close alliance with the U.S. rather than trying to adjust the bloc’s
foreign policy approach toward China.    </p>
<p>“The common denominator is that in the European Commission, security
issues now seem to take the driving seat so it’s hard to imagine Europe
not putting a lot of effort into maintaining the transatlantic alliance,
and it will be surprising if the EU takes a united front to prioritize
relations with China,” Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the
Royal United Services Institute, told VOA by phone.  </p>
<p>Common ground possible, some say</p>
<p>While European analysts say the effect of China’s attempt to weaken
the trans-Atlantic relationship may be limited, some Chinese experts say
if Trump imposes high tariffs against products from China and European
countries, Beijing and Brussels may find more common ground.  </p>
<p>“I think Trump would impose tariffs against both China and the EU, so
this may provide both sides an opportunity to reconcile the bilateral
relationship,” Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International
Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in China, told VOA by
phone.</p>

<h2 id="voters-said-no-to-electrification.-or-did-they">Voters Said No

<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDUwMjg4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzE2MjA2N30.23CxDU5gxVXQ60om4TWB9K55UKzz50NOvBZ0G_IaVHw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Berkeley, California and Washington State put the transition to
all-electric buildings on the ballot last week, and in both cases, it
seemed to fail the test. Voters in Berkeley overwhelmingly rejected a
proposed tax on natural gas that would raise money for electrification
projects. In one fell swoop, voters in Washington State repealed several
of their nation-leading policies that encourage electric over gas
appliances and barred cities and towns from passing similar policies in
the future.
</p>
<p>
On the face of things, the results appear to show voters retreating from
ambitious climate action and rejecting electrification — a concerning
signal at a time when federal support for decarbonization is about to
evaporate and state and local leadership to cut emissions will become
paramount. But the specific circumstances behind each vote suggest
that’s not the whole story.
</p>
<p>
The Berkeley proposal was submitted by a small group of activists who
knew it was more ideologically driven than politically feasible, and it
proved to be controversial even among diehard climate advocates in the
city. The Washington State initiative slid onto the ballot just three
months before the election and ultimately passed on a razor thin margin.
The two cases offer distinct lessons and<strong> </strong>takeaways, but
to climate advocates, a budding backlash to electrification is not one
of them.
</p>
<h3>
Berkeley
</h3>
<p>
The Berkeley proposal, otherwise known as Measure GG, was largely
written by one person. Daniel Tahara is a software engineer at Tesla by
day, and a climate activist by night with 350 Bay Area, a local chapter
of the national climate advocacy group 350.org. For the past few years,
he’s been animated by a question that I, too, am frequently asking: How
are most people going to afford the steep cost of retrofitting their
homes to use electric appliances?
</p>
<p>
To Tahara, finding an answer became more pressing last year when the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District, a regional authority that
regulates pollution, approved rules to phase out the sale of gas
appliances. Starting in 2027, Berkeley residents will no longer be able
to purchase a new gas-fired water heater if their old one fails —
they’ll have to go electric. The rule applies to gas-fired furnaces and
boilers in 2029. “We’ve got a lot of old buildings,” Tahara told me.
“They would need a lot of electrical work to support new appliances, and
people just don’t have the money for it.”
</p>
<p>
His solution was Measure GG, an ordinance that would have imposed a tax
of $2.96 per therm of natural gas used by buildings larger than 15,000
square feet. The estimated $26.7 million per year raised by the tax
would go into a fund to help everyone else in town pay for
electrification retrofits.
</p>
<p>
Tahara rallied a number of
<a href="https://fossilfreeberkeley.org/endorsements/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>local
environmental and community groups</u></a> around the idea, but he did
not have the support of the bigger non-profits and advocacy orgs that
work on electrification policy in California, including the Building
Decarbonization Coalition, Rewiring America, RMI, the Sierra Club, or
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</p>
<p>
“Any large blanket tax hike without input from those it would impact, no
plans for a managed transition to the new fees, and no analysis on who
is most likely to benefit or be burdened is likely to face real
challenges with voters,” Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, the senior manager
of building decarbonization for the NRDC, told me via email. “It is very
important for tax-based policy proposals to be robust and thoroughly
socialized.”
</p>
<p>
I also talked to several Berkeley-based electrification supporters who
voted no on Measure GG. Tom Graly, who chairs a local electrification
working group, told me part of the reason the policy proved so
controversial is that it singled out some of the city’s most beloved
institutions, such as the Berkeley Bowl supermarket, a local chain, and
the Berkeley Repertory Theater. The theater estimated the tax would cost
it up to $69,000 per year, while converting off of gas would cost
millions. “This well-intentioned ballot measure with its immediate
implementation would be very harmful to our struggling organization,”
Tom Parrish, the theater’s managing director said in a
<a href="https://www.noongg.org/what_they_re_saying" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a>
for the “No on GG” campaign.
</p>
<p>
Tahara
<a href="https://fossilfreeberkeley.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fossil-Free-Berkeley-Large-Buildings-Fossil-Fuel-Tax-Whitepaper-Policy-Analysis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>based
the tax</u></a> on estimates for what’s called the “social cost of
carbon,” or the projected economic damage that every additional ton of
carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere will cause. But the number Tahara
chose was on the high end — more than double the number the Biden
administration uses when it weighs the costs and benefits of new
regulations on carbon. If passed, the tax would more than double the
cost of using natural gas in large buildings. He said some national
groups gave him feedback on the proposal, like phasing in the tax over
time and building in more exemptions, which he might consider for a
future version. But he and his partners on the measure wanted to
preserve their core thesis, which was that climate damages are already
happening and are unaccounted for.
</p>
<p>
“I think part of our responsibility as local activists is to put out new
ideas, to push the status quo,” he said. “I don’t think there’s been a
lot of that that’s been happening in the last couple years.”
</p>
<p>
In Tahara’s view, the measure failed because the opposition campaign had
a lot more money, and because even though Berkeley is often called the
birthplace of the electrify everything movement, there’s still a lot of
people in town who are completely unaware of the harm natural gas causes
to the climate and to public health. On that, Graly agreed. “There’s a
huge education gap,” he said. “People just don’t think about hot water.
They turn on the faucet and the water is hot, and they’re happy.”
</p>
<h3>
Washington
</h3>
<p>
Initiative 2066 in Washington State was a wide-ranging proposal to both
roll back existing policies and preempt future ones. It was so
wide-ranging, in fact, that its opponents believe it’s illegal under the
state’s “single subject” rule for ballot measures, and they plan to
fight it in court.
</p>
<p>
If the measure stands, it will invalidate the state’s nation-leading
residential and commercial energy codes that strongly incentivize
builders to forego gas hookups. It will remove a provision in state
statute that requires Washington’s energy codes to gradually tighten
toward zero-emissions new construction by 2031. It will repeal key parts
of a law the state legislature passed earlier this year that require
Washington’s biggest utility, Puget Sound Energy, to consider
alternatives to replacing aging gas infrastructure or building new gas
pipelines. And it will ban cities and towns from passing any local
ordinances that “prohibit, penalize, or discourage” the use of gas in
buildings.
</p>
<p>
The initiative was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lets-go-washington" target="_self"><u>one
of four put on the ballot by Let’s Go Washington</u></a>, a group
bankrolled by hedge fund manager and multimillionaire Brian Heywood, and
had the Building Industry Association of Washington as its primary
sponsor, alongside a number of other pro-gas, pro-business, and realty
groups.
</p>
<p>
There’s no doubt 2066 is a significant setback in the state’s progress
toward cutting carbon emissions. But when I asked climate advocates in
Washington how they were interpreting the outcome, they pointed to a
handful of reasons why they weren’t too concerned about public sentiment
around decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
First, the vote was incredibly close, with just over 51% of voters
checking “yes.” Second, another initiative Let’s Go Washington put on
the ballot — 2117, which would have repealed the state’s big umbrella
climate law that puts a declining cap on emissions — unambiguously
failed, with 62% voting “no.” Third, they argue the split reflects
confusion about what 2066 would do.
</p>
<p>
The “yes on 2066” campaign sold it as a measure to “protect energy
choice” and “stop the gas ban,” warning that otherwise utility rates
would increase and the state would force homeowners to pay tens of
thousands of dollars to retrofit their homes. There are kernels of truth
to the messaging — the state’s building codes seriously limit
developers’ ability to put gas hookups in new construction without
outright banning them. The new law affecting Puget Sound Energy is
primarily a planning policy that requires the utility to consider
alternatives to gas infrastructure, but it doesn’t force anyone to get
off gas, and regulators are likely to approve only those alternatives
that save ratepayers money.
</p>
<p>
“I think voters were responding to a lot of misinformation and
fear-mongering,” said Leah Missik, the Washington deputy policy director
for Climate Solutions, a regional nonprofit that helped spearhead the
“no on 2066” campaign. She emphasized that it was put on the ballot in
July, giving groups like hers only a few months to drum up their
response to it, whereas they knew about 2117 for over a year, and thus
had a lot more time to educate voters on what that initiative would do.
</p>
<p>
The confusion probably also wasn’t helped by the fact that the policies
2066 repealed were incredibly wonky, dealing with building codes and
utility planning.
</p>
<p>
“I think that given all of those headwinds, the fact that about half of
Washingtonians still voted against initiative 2066 is a testament to how
popular climate action is in the state,” Emily Moore, the director of
the climate and energy program at the Sightline Institute, a
Seattle-based think tank, told me.
</p>
<p>
Sightline didn’t campaign for or against the measure, but Moore had some
takeaways from the vote. She said environmental groups spent a lot of
their energy countering the narrative that there was a gas ban, which
may have inadvertently reinforced the idea. One lesson for the future
might be to put more emphasis on the benefits of electrification, like
the fact that heat pumps provide both heating and cooling and half of
the state doesn’t currently have air conditioning. The other
anti-climate measure, 2117, may have failed so decisively because
Washington’s emission cap policy has raised more then $2 billion in
funding for projects that people are already seeing the benefits of,
like free transit passes.
</p>
<p>
“Likely a no vote on that one felt like getting to keep good things,”
she told me. “I think we have more to do to show that getting off of gas
means getting good things too.”

taps senator, former rival Marco Rubio as his top diplomat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the
next U.S. secretary of state is Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who
has been in the Senate since 2011 and serves on the chamber’s foreign
relations and intelligence committees.</p>
<p>Trump, in a statement Wednesday, called Rubio a highly respected
leader and a very powerful voice for freedom who “will be a strong
Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless
Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.”</p>
<p>Rubio, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
and a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, is regarded
as intelligent, ambitious and well-liked by Senate colleagues of both
parties.</p>
<p>If Rubio, who is 53 and the son of Cuban immigrants, is confirmed by
his Senate colleagues, he would become the first Latino secretary of
state. In that role, he would be tasked with helping to implement
Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.</p>
<p>After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Rubio was a
vocal supporter of Kyiv. More recently, he has called for negotiations
to end the conflict and voted in April against a $95 billion military
aid package for the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Rubio is a strong supporter of Israel, in line with Trump’s stance.
He has exhibited a tough stance toward authoritarian regimes in Cuba,
Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as toward the communist leadership in
Beijing.</p>
<p>In response, China has banned the senator from entering the country —
something that likely will change if Rubio is confirmed as secretary of
state.</p>
<p>Some leading Democrats in Congress, who will be the opposition party
in January, are making positive comments about the Republican.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a good relationship with Marco, and I think Marco is very
capable,” Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who has served on the
intelligence committee with Rubio, told VOA after Rubio’s name was
circulated in media reports.</p>
<p>On social media, Democratic Senator John Fetterman called Rubio “a
strong choice,” adding that he looks forward to voting for his
confirmation.</p>
<p>“Compared to some of the other names that were floating around,
people who really don’t have any experience in foreign policy, I think
this is a pretty good one,” former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger
said on CNN before Trump’s official announcement.</p>
<p>In choosing members for his Cabinet and senior White House staff,
Trump is generally emphasizing loyalty rather than experience. Rubio
campaigned for Trump during this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>The two had been rivals in the Republican presidential primary eight
years ago. Trump had repeatedly belittled the senator, while Rubio
questioned the New York real estate investor’s qualification for the
presidency, calling Trump “a con man,” deemed him dangerous and someone
who could not be trusted with the launch codes for nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>After Trump won the party’s nomination and the presidency, the
relationship warmed. But Rubio did not side with Trump when he refused
to accept defeat at the hands of Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden
four years ago. After Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on
Jan. 6, 2021, Rubio condemned the violence, calling the attackers
“unpatriotic” and “un-American” “low-lives.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trump considered Rubio, a behind-the-scenes
campaign foreign policy adviser, as his running mate before selecting
Republican Senator JD Vance.</p>
<p>Should Rubio take the job, he would have to vacate his Senate seat. A
successor would then be selected by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>Among the candidates being promoted by influential Republicans for
the Senate seat is Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National
Committee and Trump’s daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>
The Trump administration is hoping to kill the $7,500 tax credit for
electric vehicle buyers, according to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
</u><u><em><em>Reuters</em></em></u><u> report</u></a> citing two
anonymous sources within the Trump transition team.
</p>
<p>
That aspiration isn’t totally unexpected — President-elect Donald Trump
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-would-consider-ending-7500-electric-vehicle-credit-2024-08-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flirted</u></a>
with ending the EV tax credit throughout the campaign. But it’s
nonetheless our first post-election sense of how the Trump
administration plans to pursue the Republican tax package that is
expected to be the centerpiece of its legislating agenda.
</p>
<p>
If the EV tax credit is repealed, it would deal a significant setback to
the American auto industry’s attempts to make the transition to electric
vehicles. General Motors, Ford, and other legacy automakers have
invested billions of dollars to build EV factories and battery plants in
order to prepare for an electric future. The Alliance for Automotive
Innovation, the automaking industry’s trade group,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/auto-trade-group-to-gop-tax-writers-keep-bidens-ev-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
privately lobbied</u></a> lawmakers to keep all of the Biden
administration’s subsidies for EV production.
</p>
<p>
GM and Ford aren’t doing this just for the climate. They’re trying to
compete with European and East Asian automakers that are transitioning
to EVs — and will continue to transition, regardless of policy changes
within the United States. BYD, the Chinese company that exclusively
makes EVs,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/11/in-a-first-byd-to-soon-topple-ford-on-deliveries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
on track this year</u></a> to sell more cars globally than Ford. That’s
the <em><em>entire Ford line-up</em></em>, not just EVs. China has
reached its commanding position in the EV industry partly by offering EV
consumers and companies more than $200 billion in subsidies, according
to
<a href="https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/chinese-ev-dilemma-subsidized-yet-striking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> from the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</p>
<p>
The rollback would also be a setback for Tesla and Rivian, the two
highest-profile American EV-only companies. Yet according to the same
<em><em>Reuters </em></em>report, Tesla
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>supports</u></a>
the plan to repeal the tax credit. Elon Musk has
<a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-tesla-ev-tax-credits-trump-biden-ira-mexico-1851603389" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asserted</u></a>
in interviews that because Tesla has more experience building EVs than
any other company, it would suffer least from the subsidy’s
disappearance. (As the country’s No. 1 EV seller, Tesla has also likely
benefited from EV tax credits — in their current and pre-Biden forms —
more than any other company.) Repeal is part of Musk’s hypothesized plan
to turn Tesla into
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>a
de facto monopoly</u></a>, controlling the entire American EV industry.
</p>
<p>
Rivian shares have fallen 11% today, while Tesla’s are down just 5%.
Ford and GM are trading flat.
</p>
<p>
The new GOP majorities in Congress hope to extend their 2017 package of
tax cuts, which
<a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
benefit</u></a> wealthy Americans. One way to pay for those tax cuts
could be to repeal the tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act,
President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law. The news today, then, is
mostly a sign that the battle lines are being drawn in the auto
industry: Much of the auto industry wants to keep the full slate of EV
subsidies. Tesla wants to take them down.

Make EV Charging Better</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
We’ve got a high-speed charging problem.
</p>
<p>
Without readily available high-speed charging, people will never let go
of their range anxiety fears and buy electric; but unless you have
people in EVs willing to pay to charge their cars, there’s no reason to
build the chargers. The Biden administration thought it could solve the
problem with money — that is, a big, federally funded build-out of
chargers that can fill an EV’s battery in 20 to 30 minutes. But even
breaking ground has been a slog. Years after Congress first approved
giving billions of dollars to states so they could fill out America’s
EV-charging corridors,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/23/us/politics/electric-vehicle-chargers-network.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>few</u></a>
projects have made it all the way through the bureaucratic process to
the point of construction.
</p>
<p>
The grant money from Biden’s laws is
<a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-623-million-grants-continue-building-out-electric" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still</u></a>
flowing, and more high-speed chargers are in the pipeline. But federal
dollars are likely to dry up in a Trump presidency that promises to
attack climate achievements like the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
Things aren’t that much rosier in private industry. Trump’s ally Elon
Musk built out the best EV charging network at Tesla and then opened it
to other automakers. This year, though, he fired the Supercharger team
amid mass layoffs. Now, at the moment Musk has Trump’s ear, EV charging
simply
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-slowdown" target="_self"><u>doesn’t
seem that important</u></a> to him. And while groups of other car
manufacturers have come together to promise more fast-charging stations
of their own, those plans may be reconsidered in a more hostile climate
for EVs.
</p>
<p>
If you’re feeling like charging gloom is a death knell for the EV
revolution, I would ask you to remember one thing: This isn’t the way
most people charge their cars.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you need DC fast chargers to take a road trip down the highway. And
for those who can’t charge at home or at work, public high-speed
charging becomes the default option — you’re not going to park at Whole
Foods long enough to put on 200 miles. But a future with high levels of
American EV adoption will be one in which most charging happens slowly,
at Level 2 chargers in people’s garages, in parking lots, and on the
<a href="https://lalights.lacity.org/connected-infrastructure/ev_stations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sides
of public streets</u></a>. Expanding our focus to low-tech EV charging,
then, is one way to make Americans more confident about ditching gas,
even during the coming Trump era redux.
</p>
<p>
For one thing, lower-tech solutions are more affordable. As the Society
of Automotive Engineers
<a href="https://sustainablecareers.sae.org/article/ac-charging-is-important/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notes</u></a>,
slower AC chargers are much cheaper for cities or businesses to install
compared to the
<a href="https://propertymanagerinsider.com/how-much-do-commercial-dc-fast-chargers-cost/#:~:text=DC%20Fast%20Chargers%20Cost%20%2428%2C000%20to%20%24140%2C000%20Installed&text=Approximate%20installation%20costs%20increase%20significantly,NetWorked%20350kW%20DCFC%20%E2%80%93%20%24140%2C000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tens</u></a>
or
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213624X23000238#:~:text=The%20CALeVIP%20(2021)%20cost%20data,California%20Energy%20Commission%2C%202022)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hundreds</u></a>
of thousands of dollars for DC fast chargers. Appropriate electrical
infrastructure already exists in many places — street lights, for
example, use a 277-volt standard that could be repurposed for slow EV
charging. All you need to do is run wires down to street level so cars
can plug in.
</p>
<p>
You probably won’t fill up your car’s battery on streetside slow
chargers. On my Tesla Model 3, this charging speed adds, at most, about
30 miles of driving range per hour. (That’s why home and office charging
is so appealing: the eight hours you spend sleeping or working is about
enough to fill up the battery.) Yet a world of ubiquitous Level 2 plugs
would add peace of mind. Think of it like plugging in your phone at a
bar or at the airport. Sometimes, a little extra juice is just what you
need to get by.
</p>
<p>
Seeing these plugs everywhere would help drivers feel like it’s not an
emergency every time the car gets a little low, and the big charging
depot (where there might be a line of cars, anyway) is miles away. Slow
chargers also put less pressure on our already-creaking electrical grid
compared to DC fast-chargers, which unleash upwards of 350 kilowatts at
once. They’re also considered to be better for the long-term health of a
battery because fast-charging leads to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYJk1Qljwgg&t=1s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>faster
degradation</u></a>, though by how much is
<a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/impacts-of-fast-charging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
clear</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Slow plugs everywhere” isn’t a perfect solution. A few
<a href="https://lalights.lacity.org/connected-infrastructure/ev_stations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>streetside
plugs</u></a> exist in my part of Los Angeles, but you’d need a lot to
make a difference; it’s not until such plugs are the norm rather than
the exception that you’d have a good chance of grabbing a spot when you
need it. Plus, infrastructure left out on the street is susceptible to
vandalism as well as normal wear and tear. That’s why some places in
Europe have embraced the
“<a href="https://www.thewattcar.com/home/byoc-could-bring-your-own-cable-ever-take-off-in-the-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bring
your own cable</u></a>” approach to such chargers so cords are not left
on the sidewalk, sitting in the rain and getting in the way.
</p>
<p>
Despite the challenges, slow charging offers states and cities miffed by
Trump’s election a low-tech way to make themselves more EV-friendly.
They could also use the power of the legislative pen to mandate that
apartment buildings and condominium developments install plugs in their
parking lots, for example. Then, blue state residents and urban dwellers
— the very people most likely to want EVs to fight climate change, but
least likely to have the ability to put in their own home plugs – can
buy an EV without also buying a lifestyle of inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
Fast-charging still matters a lot. The rapid
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1duy2zr/growth_of_ev_fast_charging_network_in_the_usa_oc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>growth</u></a>
of DC stations over the past decade has created a country where nearly
all the major interstate highways have enough plugs for EV drivers to
get by. Many more are needed in cities, along state highways, and near
far-flung destinations like the National Parks before most people will
be confident an electric vehicle can take them anywhere they want to go.
</p>
<p>
As the refrain goes, though, most people do the vast majority of their
driving within a few miles of their homes. If a rollout of slow plugs
makes it possible for them to steal a few electrons while they go about
their lives, American confidence in EVs will rise.

<p class="drop-caps">
This week we’re talking to Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado who
joined me yesterday at Heatmap’s Election Post-Game event in Washington,
D.C., for a spirited chat about the 2024 election, permitting, and
support for renewable energy in a Trump 2.0 era. We also talked about
beer and The Fray, but we’ll spare you those details. The following is
an abridged version of our conversation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So you’ve said in your time in the Senate there needs to be a
“business plan” for climate change. What’s the business plan now that
Trump is going to be president again? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I said from the moment I got to Washington that I could not understand
how we got so far down the road without any kind of plan. No one has
mapped it out – and at this point it has to change – but there’s no
sense of a plan.
</p>
<p>
Right now we have to look at the possibility of dramatic rollbacks from
a lot of legislation that got passed in 2023. The Inflation Reduction
Act, the largest financial commitment to addressing climate change in
the history of the world. I think the CHIPS and Science Act has a lot of
stuff in it that over time is going to have dramatic benefits in terms
of addressing climate. Rolling back those efforts for the simple purpose
of giving another tax break to the publicly traded stocks of America
doesn’t seem constructive.
</p>
<p>
One thing that’ll make that difficult is many of the people who worked
so hard to elect Donald Trump are receiving those benefits and those
jobs. A lot of those tax credits are being spent in red states.
</p>
<p>
Faced with that rollback, which I think is really an interruption and
which slows down the momentum – you want to disrupt the business plan,
you want to throw a wrench in the gears, one way to do that is to create
unpredictability. That anything agreed to [isn’t] going to stay the same
for more than two years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I’ve heard the argument a lot before, the past few years, that a
lot of the money being spent is going to red states. Why was that not an
election winning argument in these states? </strong>
</p>
<p>
My impression is people basically felt that the elites – Democrats and
Republican elites – are looking down on them. They’re being judged by a
woke culture. They’re being bossed around. Well over 2/3rds of the
people who start business aren’t doing it to make a lot of money.
They’re doing it because they can’t stand having a boss. They’re doing
it because they want to be in control of their lives, their job, their
work, their hours, their mission. And we Democrats did a piss poor
disappointing job of communicating that way.
</p>
<p>
There’s a whole bunch of reasons why this happened like it did. Hearing
the war stories the past couple of days, the kinds of ads that were used
as a way of taking down Democrats were pretty outrageous.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s to come with permitting reform? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think we’re seeing an alignment of self interest around permitting
reform. Most of the large environmental organizations recognize that if
we’re going to successfully address climate change, we’ve got to get
transmission lines – you can’t spend 20 years permitting transmission
lines. We’ve got to go faster. The time, sense of urgency we have, is
not really sufficient. The same thing is true about critical minerals.
We’re going to need so much of them and we haven’t really identified
where they’re going to come from.
</p>
<p>
The bill that’s sitting there right now, I think we can get that passed.
I’m not saying we’re going to. But I’m saying we have a very good chance
of Republicans and Democrats lining up and saying, <em><em>alright I
don’t like a lot of this, but we need it. </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>So you think the first place people are going to go is the
Manchin-Barrasso bill? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah I think in the short-term I think that’s where they’re going to
give their best shot.
</p>
<p>
Both sides have certain parts of that bill they are really unhappy with,
and they modified certain parts of it, so [we’ll] come back from recess
and everyone’ll [be] taking a fresh look at it and say well I still
don’t like this but it’s not as bad as it was before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There’s some worry in some corners of climate advocacy spaces
that they’ll have less of an ear from members of Congress in light of
the election results. In listening to more progressive environmentalists
who’ve been critical of the bill, is listening to them a politically
smart idea? Practically smart idea?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think it’s a smart idea politically or practically because I do
feel this sense of urgency that we’ve got to go now.
</p>
<p>
With the Barrasso-Manchin bill, we’re still going to have to do all this
work. We’re just going to do it in six months or a year or two years
down the road and it takes us further and further away from dealing with
the issue. The costs are asymptotic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What climate gains will be made this Congress aside from
permitting reform? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think this great transition’s going to continue. It might slow down a
little bit.
</p>
<p>
There is genuine factual basis that this transition makes sense on so
many levels. Politically, it’s not something you want to talk about. But
we as a country have to move in that direction. Maybe talk a little
less, do a little more? I heard that advice in the musical Hamilton –
talk less, smile more. We have to do the opposite, do more and smile
less.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you mean by the transition being something you don’t
want to talk about? </strong>
</p>
<p>
As you’re describing the cost of waiting for people, they can get into
the nits and gnats where they can go back to who they represent and say
<em><em>hey, there’s a problem. </em></em>The same thing happens when we
talk about it. Try to talk about the issues in the broadest, most
fundamental ways, because that’s the hardest way for it to be attacked.
Just having the broad statement is going to be more effective with a
large group of people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So I asked if progress will be made on climate in Congress
besides permitting and you didn’t say yes…</strong>
</p>
<p>
No, I’ll say yes. The great thing about the Inflation Reduction Act is
that it put a lot of things in play. Carbon capture, there’s a bunch of
research projects and a couple of implementations in red states where
they are making great progress in terms of how they can get carbon out
of the air in an increasingly cost-effective way. I haven’t seen it make
any kind of economic sense, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t going to
get there. Hydrogen is a huge thing. Looking at some of the new nuclear
reactors, where they’re looking at types of fusion reactors, small and
large. Climate change is not going to allow us to go and pick out our
favorite treats.

<p>
<strong>1. Forget about the IRA </strong>– As the dust has settled
post-election, it’s becoming clearer far more than the IRA is at stake
in the coming Trump 2.0 administration – namely, whether what people
expect in the normal course of governing will resume at all.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Case in point: Massachusetts electeds just learned they will not be able
to complete talks on new offshore
<a href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/offshore-wind-contracts-put-off-again-until-after-trump-takes-office/" target="_blank"><u>wind
procurement contracts</u></a> until after Trump takes office. Will any
of these projects even be able to pursue federal permits?<br/>
</li>
<li>
Or take statutes and agencies once considered sacrosanct. Overnight,
<em><em>The
</em></em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/13/elon-musk-government-efficiency-congress-budget-law/" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington
Post</em></em></u></a> reported Trump may seek to unilaterally cut
programs with expired authorizations. That
<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60580" target="_blank"><u>includes</u></a>
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 – and the statute creating NOAA.<br/>
</li>
<li>
I covered Trump from the day he was sworn in, with most of my time spent
in Congress. And I’ve kept tabs with some in his braintrust over the
years. So I can tell you confidently: expect the unexpected, and don’t
count on your permits.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Money and time </strong>– Biden agencies are (predictably)
starting to get rules out the door to wrap up whatever they can before
Trump takes office.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The EPA just finished its
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-rule-reduce-wasteful-methane-emissions-and-drive-innovation-oil-and-gas" target="_blank"><u>methane
flaring rule</u></a> and the BLM put out a new
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/interior-department-proposes-strengthened-protections-greater-sage-grouse-habitat" target="_blank"><u>proposed
sage grouse strategy</u></a>. Heatmap previously
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>
the IRA’s hydrogen tax credit will also get this treatment.<br/>
</li>
<li>
I’d expect the Energy Department to also get as many contracts and
dollars out of the door so they can’t be impounded or rescinded. My vibe
checks with lobbyist friends indicate they believe all bets are off once
Trump 2.0 begins.
</li>
<li>
Are there any regulations or financing decisions you’re watching for in
the final days? Give us a holler.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. California counter-weight</strong> – California regulators
just
<a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2024/11/california-fuels-standard-gas-prices-climate-change/" target="_blank">approved
updates</a> to their fuel standard that will accelerate adoption of
lower-emissions cars.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The state is also convening a
<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/11/07/special-session-ca-values/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>special
legislative session</u></a> to consider additional measures to prepare
for legal and regulatory challenges from Trump 2.0, including climate.
The last Trump administration had sought to undo the state’s EPA waiver
allowing stricter vehicle emissions

than federal ones</u></a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Compensation fund </strong>– East Coast states this week
announced they would select BrownGreer and the Carbon Trust to help
<a href="https://www.nacleanenergy.com/wind/browngreer-in-partnership-with-the-carbon-trust-selected-to-lead-the-design-and-development-of-offshore-wind-fisheries-compensation-fund" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">create
a compensation fund</a> for fishermen impacted by offshore wind.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The fund is intended to give money that can offset the costs of any
reduction in fish stocks or fishing periods from developing offshore
wind.
</li>
<li>
Commercial and recreational fishing entrepreneurs will help manage the
fund. So will offshore wind companies, though a list of industry
participants has not been announced.

<p>
<strong>1. Magic Valley, Idaho </strong>– Sen. Jim Risch, one of the
state’s loudest opponents of the Lava Ridge wind farm, said he believes
Donald Trump will stop the project on Day 1.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In a newly-aired interview with
<a href="https://www.ktvb.com/video/news/local/208/whats-next-for-lava-ridge-wind-project-following-trumps-election/277-d33c5c07-81e3-458f-b047-595da3b807f1" target="_blank"><u>TV
outlet KTVB</u></a>, Risch said the matter has been presented to the
incoming president and that the proposal from LS Energy would be
targeted by an order similar to Biden’s stopping the Keystone XL oil
pipeline.
</li>
<li>
“When Biden took office, he walked in there [and] signed an executive
order and that was the end of the Keystone pipeline. When Donald Trump
walks into that president’s room, waiting for him is going to be a
keystone pipeline-like executive order that says Lava Ridge ain’t no
more.”
</li>
<li>
Lava Ridge has faced fierce backlash for a long time, for cultural and
environmental reasons. That’s why we at Heatmap put it at the very top
of our list of 10 at-risk projects to watch in the energy transition.
</li>
<li>
The Bureau of Land Management released a federal environmental review
for Lava Ridge in June and it sliced the project’s scope in half, from
400 turbines to a little north of 200. The next and final step would be
a record of decision formally approving it but it’s unclear when – or if
– the record of decision for the wind project may be released before
Trump leaves office.
</li>
<li>
Keep an eye out for more reporting on this potential move.

<strong>2. Hardin County, Kentucky</strong> – Lightsource, a subsidiary
of bp, is going to the mat against a chapter of prominent
anti-renewables network Citizens for Responsible Solar over a project in
the small Kentucky city of Elizabethtown.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lightsource is vying to build the 128-megawatt Telesto solar farm in
Hardin despite a planning commission that
<a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/permit-denied-for-proposed-solar-farm-in-hardin-county/article_d81a2da0-7996-11ec-af5f-7fd1ff05025a.html" target="_blank"><u>is
hostile to solar</u></a>. Their apparent solution? Build it entirely on
private land owned by individuals requesting annexations from their city
government.
</li>
<li>
Telesto’s backers have tried a charm offensive that’s included
<a href="https://kentuckysheartland.com/the-scoop/" target="_blank"><u>local
media interviews</u></a> and
<a href="https://hardinchamber.com/telesto-solar-pledges-1-million-new-community-fund-for-hardin-county/" target="_blank"><u>selected
local donations</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
But right now I’m skeptical of the project’s odds in the short term for
two reasons: city administrative staff have recommended
<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/621e6f5563bb27214819255f/t/67223c4fc049f953b885aec9/1730296911769/City+Staff+Memo+to+City+Council.pdf" target="_blank"><u>against
the annexation</u></a> and Citizens for Responsible Solar is mobilizing
its members.
</li>
<li>
“URGENT PLEA! We need to fill the room,” Hardin County Citizens for
Responsible Solar posted to
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/U8qALPwyzzF724SW/" target="_blank"><u>Facebook

A decision on annexation by the city council is expected as soon as next

<strong>3. Allegany County, New York </strong>– I’m keeping close tabs
on a new solar-farmland fight in upstate New York between a plant
nursery and a 3.7 megawatt SolAmerica solar farm.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The small town of Amity has approved the project. And until now,
Allegany County
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2023/05/19/massive-new-solar-facility-coming-to-allegany-county" target="_blank"><u>has
been</u></a> receiving new solar farms with little backlash.
</li>
<li>
But its location offers a sympathetic picture. It’s close to a small
business – and overlapping with prime farmland. So it is drawing
attention from columnists and its county legislator, Gretchen Hanchett,
who
<a href="https://wellsvillesun.com/blog/2024/11/12/not-in-my-river-valley-solar-development-targets-prime-farm-land/" target="_blank"><u>weighed
in yesterday</u></a> asking local politicians to “balance the interests
of property owners on both sides.”
</li>
<li>
This is the kind of political momentum that has led to new county-level
restrictions in the past, so now Allegany’s on ordinance watch. Hanchett
told a farmer in a county legislature meeting in August that they “have
the support of this legislature in trying to find solutions” to solar
and farmland conflicts.
</li>
<li>
“There’s a lot to learn in protecting our food supply and our small
farmers,” Hanchett said, per
<a href="https://www.alleganyco.gov/wp-content/uploads/08.07.24-Resource-Management-Minutes.pdf" target="_blank"><u>meeting

fines Meta $840 million over abusive practices benefiting Facebook
Marketplace</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Brussels — The European Commission on Thursday fined Meta Platforms
$840.24 million over abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace,
it said in a statement, confirming an earlier report by Reuters.</p>
<p>“The European Commission has fined Meta … for breaching EU antitrust
rules by tying its online classified ads service Facebook Marketplace to
its personal social network Facebook and by imposing unfair trading
conditions on other online classified ads service providers,” the
European Commission said.</p>
<p>Meta said it will appeal the decision, but in the meantime, it will
comply and will work quickly and constructively to launch a solution
which addresses the points raised.</p>
<p>The move by the European Commission comes two years after it accused
the U.S. tech giant of giving its classified ads service Facebook
Marketplace an unfair advantage by bundling the two services
together.</p>
<p>The European Union opened formal proceedings into possible
anticompetitive conduct of Facebook in June, 2021, and in December,
2022, raised concerns that Meta ties its dominant social network
Facebook to its online classified ad services.</p>
<p>Facebook launched Marketplace in 2016 and expanded into several
European countries a year later.</p>
<p>The EU decision argues that Meta imposes Facebook Marketplace on
people who use Facebook in an illegal “tie” but Meta said that argument
ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose whether to engage with
Marketplace, and many do not.</p>
<p>Meta said the Commission claimed that Marketplace had the potential
to hinder the growth of large incumbent online marketplaces in the EU
but could not find any evidence of harm to competitors.</p>
<p>Companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for
EU antitrust violations.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The satirical news publication The Onion won the bidding for Alex
Jones’ Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, backed by families of Sandy
Hook Elementary School shooting victims whom Jones owes more than $1
billion in defamation judgments for calling the massacre a hoax, the
families announced Thursday. </p>
<p>“The dissolution of Alex Jones’ assets and the death of Infowars is
the justice we have long awaited and fought for,” Robbie Parker, whose
daughter Emilie was killed in the 2012 shooting in Connecticut, said in
a statement provided by his lawyers. </p>
<p>The sale price was not immediately disclosed. </p>
<p>Jones confirmed The Onion’s acquisition of Infowars in a social media
video Thursday and said he planned to file legal challenges to stop it.
An email message seeking comment was sent to Infowars. </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what The Onion planned to do with the
conspiracy theory platform, including its website, social media
accounts, studio in Austin, Texas, trademarks and video archive. The

published this morning finds that projections for temperature increases
through 2100 remain stagnant for the third year in a row. The research
group Climate Action Tracker found that the world is likely to warm by
2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
But there’s a 50% chance the number could be lower – or higher. By 2030,
temperatures are now expected to rise somewhere between 1.9 and 2.6
degrees Celsius (3.4 and 4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a slight uptick thanks
to “minimal progress” from governments in strengthening emissions
targets. “Mixed signals from the political space are canceling each

said. “COP29 must be an enabling COP, delivering concrete outcomes to

id="facing-trumps-return-south-korea-tees-up-for-alliance-strains">Facing
Trump’s return, South Korea tees up for alliance strains</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — Following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s
electoral victory, world leaders have scrambled to secure calls and send
delegations to strengthen ties with his team.</p>
<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is taking a different approach:
golf practice.</p>
<p>South Korean presidential officials confirmed to VOA that Yoon
recently took up golf for the first time in eight years, specifically to
prepare for diplomacy with Trump, who is known for bonding with world
leaders over the sport.</p>
<p>It’s part of a broader response to the return of Trump, whose
unpredictable “America First” approach poses unique economic and
security challenges to South Korea.</p>
<p>The task may be especially difficult for Yoon, a conservative who
leaned hard into a values-based alliance with the United States under
President Joe Biden, pressing North Korea on human rights and projecting
military strength.</p>
<p>Now, Yoon must contend with Trump, a famously transactional leader
who has advocated for friendlier ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un and dismissed U.S.-South Korea military drills as costly “war
games.”</p>
<p>Trump has also consistently questioned the value of the seven-decade
alliance, even hinting at a U.S. troop withdrawal if South Korea does
not pay more.</p>
<p>Economic concerns add to South Korea’s unease, as officials worry
Trump’s talk of imposing tariffs, and a renewed U.S.-China trade war
could destabilize its export-driven economy.</p>
<p>Trump’s win has prompted soul-searching in South Korea, with many
left-leaning commentators lamenting what they see as an over-reliance on
an increasingly unreliable ally.</p>
<p>“Trump’s reelection heralds a tectonic shift in the U.S.-led
international order, which South Korea has been largely dependent on for
the past 70 years,” read a recent opinion piece in the prominent
Hankyoreh newspaper.</p>
<p>It warned that the Yoon administration, after having “placed all its
eggs in the South Korea-U.S. alliance basket,” will now “witness the
devastating consequences of such blind belief.”</p>
<p>Many conservative South Korean commentators also expressed concerns
about the future of alliance, even while noting that Trump presents
unique opportunities.</p>
<p>An editorial in the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper,
said if Trump demands an excessive increase in defense cost-sharing,
South Korea “could negotiate for independent nuclear armament in
return.”</p>
<p>Cost-sharing woes</p>
<p>Defense burden-sharing could become the first major alliance test
once Trump returns – just as it was throughout his first term.</p>
<p>Just one day before Trump’s reelection, the United States and South
Korea finalized a new agreement for Seoul to pay $1.19 billion in 2026
to support U.S. troops – an 8.3% increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>The six-year deal was widely seen as an attempt to “Trump-proof” the
alliance. However, some analysts worry it may have the opposite effect,
possibly prompting Trump to overturn the agreement unilaterally or
impose new financial demands.</p>
<p>For example, Trump could require that South Korea cover costs for
joint military exercises or the visits of “strategic assets,” such as
bombers and aircraft carriers, said Park Won-gon, a professor at Seoul’s
Ewha University.</p>
<p>Such exercises and deployments were recently expanded – a key
reassurance for South Korea, which relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella
for protection against nuclear-armed North Korea.</p>
<p>If Trump demanded payment for these activities, Park said, it would
“inevitably weaken the overall framework of extended deterrence.”</p>
<p>Abandonment concerns</p>
<p>Trump has long been a critic of U.S.-South Korea military exercises,
even scaling them back unexpectedly after his first summit with Kim in
2018. Many in South Korea now worry he could pursue renewed diplomacy
with Pyongyang that sidelines Seoul’s security interests.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump reserved his strongest criticism for
North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile launches, which
threaten the U.S. mainland, while downplaying short-range tests that
pose a more immediate risk to South Korea.</p>
<p>Analysts also fear that Trump and Kim could resume talks that
highlight their warm relations and project diplomatic progress, without
advancing denuclearization in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>“In that case, North Korea will be recognized as a de facto nuclear
state, which is a development that South Korea will find difficult to
accept,” wrote Lee Sang-hyun, a senior research fellow at Seoul’s Sejong
Institute, in an analysis of Trump’s reelection.</p>
<p>Louder nuclear calls</p>
<p>These concerns have emboldened voices within South Korea calling for
an independent nuclear arsenal – a proposal that has moved into the
mainstream under Yoon’s administration.</p>
<p>The latest high-profile figure to embrace the idea is Park Jin, who
served as Yoon’s foreign minister until earlier this year. In an
interview this week with a South Korean news outlet, Park stated that
South Korea must “seriously consider all possible security options,
including potentially acquiring nuclear capabilities,” if Trump resumes
threats to withdraw U.S. troops.</p>
<p>South Korea’s nuclear armament also has gained traction in U.S.
policy circles, particularly with a growing number of former Trump
officials. Trump himself even proposed the idea during his first
presidential campaign, though not as president.</p>
<p>But significant barriers remain. Such a move would likely provoke a
strong reaction from North Korea and China, potentially endangering
South Korea’s security during any “breakout” period. Additionally, South
Korea could face severe economic sanctions if it decided to go
nuclear.</p>
<p>Golf diplomacy</p>
<p>Together, these challenges present a major diplomatic test for Yoon,
who hopes that spending time on the golf course with Trump will offer a
chance to address them one on one.</p>
<p>Such an approach would emulate that of Japan’s late former Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, who formed a close bond with Trump and tried to
smooth bilateral frictions, in part by playing golf.</p>
<p>It’s a strategy that makes sense, according to Park, the Seoul-based
professor, who stressed the importance of personal relationships and
proactive engagement when dealing with Trump.</p>
<p>“For Trump, it’s all about who he listens to,” Park said. “He tends
to repeat what those close to him feed him, so we need to leverage close
relationships to convey our stance.”</p>

id="trump-picks-former-rival-marco-rubio-for-secretary-of-state">Trump
picks former rival Marco Rubio for secretary of state</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday
he is nominating Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of both
the foreign relations and intelligence committees and former political
rival, to be secretary of state. </p>
<p>“He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our
Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our
adversaries,” Trump said in a statement. </p>
<p>Rubio, 53, is known as a China hawk, an outspoken critic of Cuba’s
Communist government and a strong backer of Israel. In the past, he has
advocated for a more assertive U.S. foreign policy with respect to
America’s geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned
more closely with those of Trump’s “America First” approach to foreign
policy. </p>
<p>In April, Rubio was one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a
big military aid package to help Ukraine resist Russia and support other
U.S. partners, including Israel. Trump has been critical of Democratic
President Joe Biden’s continuing military assistance for Ukraine as it
fights Russia’s invasion. </p>
<p>Rubio has said in recent interviews that Kyiv needs to seek a
negotiated settlement with Russia rather than focus on regaining all of
the territory that Moscow has taken in the last decade. </p>
<p>On the Gaza war, Rubio — like Trump — has been staunchly behind
Israel, calling Hamas a terrorist organization that must be eliminated
and saying America’s role is to resupply Israel with the military
materials needed to finish the job. </p>
<p>Rubio is a top Senate China hawk, and Beijing imposed sanctions on
him in 2020 over his stance on Hong Kong’s democracy protests. This
could create difficulties for any attempts to maintain the Biden
administration’s effort to keep up diplomatic engagement with Beijing to
avoid an unintended conflict. </p>
<p>Among other things, Rubio shepherded an act through Congress that
gave Washington a new tool to bar Chinese imports over China’s treatment
of Uyghur Muslims and has also pushed a bill that would decertify Hong
Kong’s U.S. economic and trade offices. </p>
<p>Rubio had also become a strong Trump backer, after harshly
criticizing him when he ran against the former real estate developer for
president in 2016. </p>
<p>The three-term Republican senator should easily win confirmation in
the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans will hold at least a 52-48
majority starting in January. </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the intelligence
committee, quickly issued a statement praising the choice of Rubio, the
panel’s vice chairman. </p>
<p>“I have worked with Marco Rubio for more than a decade on the
Intelligence Committee, particularly closely in the last couple of years
in his role as Vice Chairman, and while we don’t always agree, he is
smart, talented, and will be a strong voice for American interests
around the globe,” Warner said in a statement. </p>
<p>Rubio, the son of immigrants from Cuba, will be the first Latino to
serve as America’s top diplomat.</p>

to control White House, Congress in early 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Republicans are set to take full control of the U.S. government by
the third week in January, with President-elect Donald Trump in the
White House and the party holding majorities in the Senate and now the
House of Representatives, where late vote counting put it over the top
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,” newly reelected
House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this week. “The American people
want us to implement and deliver that ‘America First’ agenda” espoused
by Trump.</p>
<p>Trump will be sworn in as the country’s 47th president on January 20,
two weeks after the new Congress has been seated.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, campaigned on a sweeping agenda that Democrats will be
largely powerless to stop unless joined by a handful of Republican
defectors in Congress on any specific issue that would undercut the
party’s slim majorities in both chambers.</p>
<p>Republicans will have a 53-47 edge in the Senate, and the
tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect JD Vance in the event of a
50-50 stalemate on any legislative proposal. Republicans have secured at
least 218 seats in the 435-member House, pending the outcome of nine
undecided elections for two-year terms. The party won a seat in the
Southwestern state of Arizona on Wednesday to cement its majority.</p>
<p>During his bid to win a second nonconsecutive four-year term, Trump
called for the massive deportation of millions of undocumented migrants
living in the United States to their home countries, an extension and
expansion of 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025,
further deregulation of businesses, a curb on climate controls, and
prosecution of his political opponents — people he calls “the enemy
within.”</p>
<p>Senator John Thune of South Dakota, newly elected by his fellow
Republicans as the Senate majority leader, said, “This Republican team
is united. We are on one team. We are excited to reclaim the majority
and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President
Trump’s agenda.”</p>
<p>Trump nominates loyalists</p>
<p>Trump has swiftly named an array of political loyalists to key
Cabinet positions. They remained as vocal supporters during his four
years out of office, and most of them are likely to win quick Senate
approval after confirmation hearings, as is the bipartisan tradition in
Congress when a new president takes office. They will replace officials
President Joe Biden selected after he defeated Trump in the 2020
election.</p>
<p>Trump has also called on Senate Republican leaders to allow him to
make “recess appointments,” which could occur when the chamber is not in
session and would erase the need for time-consuming and often
contentious confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>Despite the likelihood that most of his nominees will be approved,
Trump this week named three who immediately drew disparaging assessments
from several Democrats and some Republicans for their perceived lack of
credentials.</p>
<p>They are former Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general; Tulsi
Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican as director
of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth, a former junior military
officer and Fox News host as defense secretary.</p>
<p>The blowback presages tough confirmation fights for the three in the
Senate, which reviews the appointments of top-level officials and then
votes to confirm them, or on occasion, rejects the nominations of
incoming presidents and forces the White House to make another
choice.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Trump nominated former presidential candidate and
anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of
Health and Human Services; former Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Jay Clayton to be Manhattan’s top federal prosecutor; and
former Representative Doug Collins to be secretary of the Department of
Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Trump also nominated one of his personal criminal defense attorneys,
Todd Blanche, to be deputy attorney general, and another of his
attorneys, D. John Sauer, to be solicitor general.</p>
<p>Controversy surrounds Gaetz</p>
<p>At an event Thursday night at Trump’s Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, Trump
said he intended to nominate North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum to lead
the Interior Department.</p>
<p>The appointment of Gaetz, 42, could prove particularly problematic,
with some senators openly questioning whether he can win a 51-vote
majority to assume the government’s top law enforcement position. A
House ethics committee probe was in the final stages of investigating
whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use when he
announced his resignation from the chamber late Wednesday, ending the
probe.</p>
<p>The Justice Department he hopes to lead had already decided not to
pursue criminal charges. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing.</p>
<p>On NBC’s “Meet the Press NOW,” John Bolton, one of Trump’s first-term
national security advisers who since has become a vocal critic, said
Gaetz’s appointment “must be the worst nomination for a Cabinet position
in American history.”</p>
<p>Bolton added that Gabbard’s nomination was “hilarious” and “second
worst.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,”
said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. “This one was not on
my bingo card.”</p>
<p>Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she was “shocked” that
Trump chose Gaetz, while another Republican senator, Kevin Cramer of
North Dakota, questioned whether Gaetz could be confirmed, adding, “I
need to think about that one.”</p>
<p>An incoming freshman Democratic senator, Andrew Kim, said he did not
need to consider more information at a confirmation hearing to know that
he would vote against Gaetz.</p>
<p>Gaetz is also disliked by some Republican colleagues for his leading
role last year in a successful effort to oust a fellow Republican, Kevin
McCarthy, from his job as House speaker, the lead position in the
chamber and second in line to the presidency after the vice
president.</p>
<p>Trump heralded his nomination of Gaetz, newly elected to a fifth term
in the House, saying he had “distinguished himself in Congress through
his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of
Justice” and would “root out systemic corruption” at the agency.</p>
<p>Experience questioned</p>
<p>Gabbard, 43, has been attacked for her lack of direct experience in
intelligence and accused of disseminating pro-Russian disinformation. If
confirmed, she will be tasked with overseeing 18 U.S. intelligence
agencies. She won over Trump with her switch from being a one-time
Democratic House member from Hawaii to changing parties and staunchly
advocating for his election.</p>
<p>She prepped Trump for his only debate against Vice President Kamala
Harris, the Democrat he defeated in the November 5 election.</p>
<p>Critics have assailed Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated former
military officer, as someone who lacks managerial experience in the
military or business world. A weekend anchor on Fox News, he has voiced
his opinions on military operations, including his opposition to women
serving in combat roles, saying they lack as much physical strength as
men. He has lobbied Trump to pardon military service members accused of
war crimes.</p>
<p>Hegseth is certain to face near universal opposition from Senate
Democrats voting on his confirmation, and some Republicans are
expressing concern.</p>
<p>A descendant of the Kennedy family political dynasty, Kennedy, 70,
has been one of the country’s most prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy
theorists for years.</p>
<p>At a rally in October, Trump indicated that if he was reelected, he
would let Kennedy oversee a public health portfolio. Last week, Kennedy
said he would “immediately” begin studying vaccine safety. He also has
pledged to formally recommend states and municipalities remove fluoride
from public water.</p>
<p>An attorney at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Clayton, 58, will be
nominated to be the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York
— perhaps better known as the sheriff of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Although the office is often responsible for policing financial
fraud, Clayton himself does not have any prosecutorial experience. While
at the SEC, Clayton, a political independent, developed a reputation for
trying to create consensus with the agency’s Democratic
commissioners.</p>
<p>Doug Collins, 58, served in Congress from 2013 to 2021 and
unsuccessfully ran for election to be a U.S. senator for Georgia in
2020. He is currently a chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve
Command.</p>
<p>Blanche, 50, represented Trump in several of the criminal cases
against the former president. The attorney played a key role in Trump’s
defense teams in both the Manhattan hush money case, which led to a
conviction earlier this year, and the federal classified documents
prosecution, which a judge dismissed this past summer. Blanche also
played a role in the federal case regarding the January 6, 2021,
attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>And Sauer, 50, who previously served as the solicitor general of
Missouri, successfully defended Trump before the Supreme Court in a case
that gave Trump and all future U.S. presidents vast immunity from
prosecution for what are deemed official acts.</p>
<p>Burgum, 67, grew up in a small town in North Dakota and earned a
master’s in business administration from Stanford University. He got
into software and led Great Plains Software until Microsoft bought it in
2001, for $1.1 billion. He then tried his hand in politics, running for
governor and winning on his first try.</p>
<p>The president-elect’s first choices for high-level positions in his
nascent administration have won broad acceptance from fellow
Republicans, including his co-campaign manager Susie Wiles as White
House chief of staff, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of
state and Representative Mike Waltz of Florida as national security
adviser.</p>
<p>Trump returned triumphantly to Washington on Wednesday, pledging a
smooth transition of power in January as he met for two hours at the
White House with Biden, his longtime political rival.</p>

APEC and G20, Biden faces leaders worried about US policy changes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — In what will likely be his farewell appearance on the
world stage, President Joe Biden faces a daunting question: what to tell
world leaders wondering about potential changes in U.S. policies when
President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his America
First agenda.</p>
<p>Biden arrived Thursday in Peru and will visit Brazil afterward for
two major economic summits.</p>
<p>Biden is scheduled to spend Friday and Saturday in Lima with leaders
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, made up of 21 member
economies that promote free trade in the region.</p>
<p>He will be in Rio de Janeiro on Monday and Tuesday to meet with
leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies at the Group of 20
summit.</p>
<p>On the way to Rio from Lima, Biden will make a brief stop at Manaus
for a climate-focused engagement in Brazil’s state of Amazonas.</p>
<p>In his meetings, Biden must face allies and partners who four years
ago may have been skeptical about his “America is back” message and the
durability of U.S. global commitments. These leaders saw Trump, during
his first term, act to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord
and threaten to pull out of NATO.</p>
<p>Uncertainties about future U.S. policy will complicate efforts to
reach an agenda on issues of global concern such as trade, poverty and
debt alleviation, climate change, sustainable development, and green
energy.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of combination of lamenting, speculation,
guessing about what we’ll see coming first in terms of policies out of
the campaign and how countries are best able to position themselves,”
said Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy
Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>‘America’s allies are vital’</p>
<p>To these leaders, Biden’s message is that “America’s allies are vital
to America’s national security,” said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, who previewed the trip to reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“They make us stronger. They multiply our capability. They take a
burden off of our shoulders. They contribute to our common causes,”
Sullivan said. He underscored that Biden would be attending the APEC
summit when U.S. alliances in the region were at an “all-time high,”
with bolstered ties with Japan, Korea, Australia and the
Philippines.</p>
<p>Biden will hold a trilateral meeting on the sidelines of APEC with
President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba
of Japan to “discuss the importance of institutionalizing” the progress
made so that it carries forward through the transition to the new
administration, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Whatever the questions surrounding the next administration, Biden
will emphasize his faith in the “ideals of American engagement around
the world,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s
GeoEconomics Center.</p>
<p>“He believes it is in the best interest of both America and the world
for it to continue,” Lipsky said. “And not one election or one president
can undercut that, from his perspective.”</p>
<p>Biden’s agenda</p>
<p>In Rio de Janeiro, Biden will “demonstrate the strong value
proposition of the United States to developing countries and lead the
G20 to work together to address shared global challenges,” the White
House said.</p>
<p>He is expected to hold bilateral meetings with summit hosts Peruvian
President Dina Boluarte and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da
Silva.</p>
<p>In Lima, he is set to support Peru’s initiative to expand APEC’s
economic inclusion efforts to empower workers in the informal economy,
said Matt Murray, U.S. senior official for APEC.</p>
<p>In Rio, he will focus on workers’ rights and clean economic growth
and attend the launch of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty,
Lula’s initiative aimed at accelerating global efforts to reduce hunger
and poverty by 2030.</p>
<p>In Manaus, Biden will make history as the first sitting U.S.
president to visit the Brazilian Amazon. There, he will deliver remarks
on climate conservation and engage Indigenous leaders working to
preserve the rainforest.</p>
<p>Symbolic and short-lived</p>
<p>Many of Biden’s efforts will be mostly symbolic and short-lived, as
the incoming U.S. administration could bring dramatically different
priorities on global welfare programs and climate change.</p>
<p>Analysts say that while the world has watched U.S. leadership swing
from Republican to Democratic and back again in recent years, Chinese
President Xi Jinping will seek to project an image of stability as he
exerts his vision of China’s increased role on the global stage.</p>
<p>In Peru, Xi will inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport, part of China’s
infrastructure investment program that has bought him influence in
various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Beijing has increased diplomatic engagement in the region, with Xi
visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according
to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Summit hosts Peru and Brazil are
set to honor him with state visits this month.</p>
<p>A meeting between Biden and Xi, likely their last during Biden’s
term, is scheduled in Lima for Saturday. The meeting comes as Trump
appoints ardent China critics in key foreign policy positions, moves
that could lead to a more confrontational U.S. posture toward
Beijing.</p>
<p>Whatever the next administration decides, it’s going to need to find
ways to manage the “tough, complicated relationship” between the U.S.
and China, a senior official said when asked what Biden might tell Xi to
expect from the incoming administration.</p>

id="conservative-lawyer-ted-olson-former-us-solicitor-general-dies-at-84">Conservative
lawyer Ted Olson, former US solicitor general, dies at 84</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, one of the
country’s best-known conservative lawyers who served two Republican
presidents and successfully argued on behalf of same-sex marriage, died
Wednesday. He was 84.</p>
<p>The law firm Gibson Dunn, where Olson had practiced since 1965,
announced his death on its website. No cause of death was given.</p>
<p>Olson was at the center of some of the biggest cases of recent
decades, including a win on behalf of George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida
presidential election recount dispute that went before the U.S. Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>“Even in a town full of lawyers, Ted’s career as a litigator was
particularly prolific,” said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate
Republican leader. “More importantly, I count myself among so many in
Washington who knew Ted as a good and decent man.”</p>
<p>Bush made Olson his solicitor general, a post the lawyer held from
2001 to 2004. Olson had previously served in the Justice Department as
an assistant attorney general during President Ronald Reagan’s first
term in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>During his career, Olson argued 65 cases before the Supreme Court,
according to Gibson Dunn.</p>
<p>“They weren’t just little cases,” said Theodore Boutrous, a partner
at the law firm who worked with Olson for 37 years. “Many of them were
big, blockbuster cases that helped shape our society.”</p>
<p>Those included the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a
2010 case that eliminated many limits on political giving, and a
successful challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to rescind
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
<p>“He’s the greatest lawyer I’ve ever worked with or seen in action,”
said Boutrous, who worked so closely with Olson that they were known at
Gibson Dunn as “the two Teds.” “He was an entertaining and forceful
advocate who could go toe to toe with the Supreme Court justices in a
way few lawyers could. They respected him so much.”</p>
<p>One of Olson’s most prominent cases put him at odds with many fellow
conservatives. After California adopted a ban on same-sex marriage in
2008, Olson joined forces with former adversary David Boies, who had
represented Democrat Al Gore in the presidential election case, to
represent California couples seeking the right to marry.</p>
<p>During closing arguments, Olson contended that tradition or fears of
harm to heterosexual unions were legally insufficient grounds to
discriminate against same-sex couples.</p>
<p>“It is the right of individuals, not an indulgence to be dispensed by
the state,” Olson said. “The right to marry, to choose to marry, has
never been tied to procreation.”</p>
<p>A federal judge in California ruled in 2010 that the state’s ban
violated the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court let that decision
stand in 2013.</p>
<p>“This is the most important thing I’ve ever done, as an attorney or a
person,” Olson later said in a documentary film about the marriage
case.</p>
<p>He told The Associated Press in 2014 that the marriage case was
important because it “involves tens of thousands of people in
California, but really millions of people throughout the United States
and beyond that to the world.”</p>
<p>His decision to join the case added a prominent conservative voice to
the rapidly shifting views on same-sex marriage across the country.</p>
<p>Boies remembered Olson as a giant in legal circles who “left the law,
our country, and each of us better than he found us. Few people are a
hero to those that know them well. Ted was a hero to those who knew him
best.”</p>
<p>Olson’s personal life also intersected tragically with the nation’s
history when his third wife, well-known conservative legal analyst
Barbara Olson, died on September 11, 2001. She was a passenger on
American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon.</p>
<p>His other high-profile clients have included quarterback Tom Brady
during the “Deflategate” scandal of 2016 and technology company Apple in
a legal battle with the FBI over unlocking the phone of a shooter who
killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015.</p>
<p>The range of his career and his stature on the national stage were
unmatched, said Barbara Becker, managing partner of Gibson Dunn.</p>
<p>In a statement, she described Olson as “a titan of the legal
profession and one of the most extraordinary and eloquent advocates of
our time.”</p>

<h2 id="fbi-raids-polymarket-ceos-home-seizing-phone-electronics">FBI
raids Polymarket CEO’s home, seizing phone, electronics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Federal law enforcement agents raided the downtown New
York home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan on Wednesday, seizing his
phone and electronics, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The early morning raid of Coplan’s SoHo apartment followed last
week’s presidential election, in which bettors on Polymarket, an
offshore, crypto-fueled election gambling website, had for weeks put
Donald Trump’s odds drastically higher than those of Vice President
Kamala Harris, in sharp divergence from opinion polls.</p>
<p>Coplan, Polymarket’s 26-year-old founder, was roused from his bed at
6 a.m. by FBI agents demanding he give them his electronic devices.</p>
<p>The DOJ is investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing U.S.-based
users to bet on the site, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Polymarket declined to comment on those allegations, but a
spokesperson said the FBI raid was “obvious political retribution by the
outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that
correctly called the 2024 presidential election.”</p>
<p>The company told Reuters that Coplan had not been arrested or taken
into custody.</p>
<p>The FBI declined to comment. The Department of Justice and the White
House did not respond to requests for comment on the raid.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the presidential election, the site gained
widespread attention for the way it placed Trump’s odds high above those
of Harris, when opinion polls had for months shown the race in a dead
heat.</p>
<p>Polymarket, which does not allow trading in the U.S., also gained
scrutiny after a mystery French trader, known as the Polymarket whale,
made large bets on Trump winning the election.</p>
<p>The trader’s huge wagers came in tandem with a dramatic rise in
Trump’s chances on the exchanges.</p>
<p>He walked away with more than $46 million in profit.</p>
<p>Last week, France’s gambling regulator said it was examining whether
Polymarket complies with French laws.</p>

id="suspected-chinese-hack-of-us-telecoms-reveals-broader-plot">Suspected
Chinese hack of US telecoms reveals broader plot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A hack of U.S. telecommunications systems linked to
China that initially appeared to focus on the American presidential
campaigns goes much deeper, according to investigators, and is likely
part of a vast effort by Beijing to spy on the United States.</p>
<p>The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
warned on Wednesday that the breach first detected late last month has
now “revealed a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign.”</p>
<p>The two agencies said in a statement that their investigation has
confirmed Chinese-linked hackers compromised the networks of multiple
U.S. telecommunication companies, gaining access to a potential treasure
trove of information.</p>
<p>Specifically, they said the hackers would have been able to access
customer call records and infiltrate the private communications of a
select number of government officials and politicians.</p>
<p>Additionally, the hackers appear to have been able to copy
information requested by U.S. law enforcement as a result of court
orders.</p>
<p>“We expect our understanding of these compromises to grow as the
investigation continues,” the FBI and CISA said.</p>
<p>“We encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to
engage its local FBI field office or CISA,” they added.</p>
<p>The two agencies first announced they were investigating a breach of
U.S. telecommunications systems in late October, less than two weeks
before U.S. voters cast their ballots in nationwide elections.</p>
<p>Word of the breach followed a report by The New York Times that
Chinese hackers were thought to have broken into telecommunications
networks to target the campaign of President-elect Donald Trump —
including phones used by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign confirmed the breach in a statement to VOA.
Separately, a person familiar with the investigation told VOA that
people affiliated with the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris were
also targeted.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington at the time dismissed the U.S.
hacking allegations as disinformation, calling the U.S. “the origin and
the biggest perpetrator of cyberattacks.”</p>
<p>Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu on Thursday rejected the latest U.S.
statements as disinformation.</p>
<p>“China firmly opposes the U.S.’s smear attacks against China without
any factual basis,” he said in an email. “We hope that relevant parties
will adopt a professional and responsible attitude when characterizing
cyber incidents, basing their conclusions on sufficient evidence rather
than unfounded speculation and accusations.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies warned for months that foreign adversaries
were using a combination of cyberattacks and influence operations to
meddle with the November 5 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>In addition, reports issued by private cybersecurity firms indicated
a significant uptick in activity by actors linked to Russia, China and
Iran.</p>
<p>All three nations have repeatedly denied accusations of election
meddling.</p>
<p>U.S. agencies, led by CISA and the FBI, have long warned that
China-linked hackers have burrowed into U.S. computer systems and
networks, in some cases hiding for years.</p>
<p>The China-linked group, known as Volt Typhoon, has been “positioning
itself to launch destructive cyberattacks that would jeopardize the
physical safety of Americans,” according to an advisory issued in
February.</p>
<p>“What we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” CISA
Director Jen Easterly said in a statement at the time.</p>

court overturns 1983 Beirut bombing victims’ $1.68B judgment against
Iran bank</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday threw out a $1.68
billion judgment against Iran’s central bank that had been won by family
members of troops killed and injured in the 1983 bombing of the U.S.
Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. </p>
<p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court
judge should have addressed questions of state law before ruling against
Bank Markazi and Luxembourg intermediary Clearstream Banking, a unit of
Deutsche Boerse. </p>
<p>In a 3-0 decision, the panel also rejected a claim that a 2019
federal law designed to make it easier to seize Iranian assets held
outside the United States waived Bank Markazi’s sovereign immunity. </p>
<p>That law “neither abrogates Bank Markazi’s jurisdictional immunity
nor provides an independent grant of subject matter jurisdiction,”
Circuit Judge Robert Sack wrote. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The court returned the case to U.S. District Loretta Preska, in
Manhattan to address state law questions in the 11-year-old case, and
whether the case can proceed in Bank Markazi’s absence. </p>
<p>Bombing victims sought to hold Iran liable for providing material
support for the October 23, 1983, suicide attack that killed 241 U.S.
service members, by seizing bond proceeds held by Clearstream in a
blocked account on Bank Markazi’s behalf. </p>
<p>Bank Markazi claimed immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act, which generally shields foreign governments from liability in U.S.
courts. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests
for comment. Bank Markazi’s and Clearstream’s lawyers did not

<p>Iran, other U.S.-designated sponsors of terrorism, and banks accused
of providing services to terrorists face thousands of claims in U.S.
courts by victims and their families. It is often difficult for these
claimants to collect judgments. </p>
<p>In the Bank Markazi case, the plaintiffs sued in 2013 to partially
satisfy a $2.65 billion default judgment they had won against Iran in
2007. </p>
<p>Another judge dismissed the case in 2015, but the 2nd Circuit Court
revived it in 2017. </p>
<p>Then in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a fresh review in light
of the 2019 law, which then-President Donald Trump signed as part of the
National Defense Authorization Act. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs have said they hold more than $4 billion of judgments
against Iran and have been unable to collect for decades. </p>

The national inflation rate doesn’t give a full picture of rising
prices. Some places have it better than others. In this episode, housing
costs have driven inflation down in some places, and kept rates above
the average in others. Plus: Will China have to pay its fair share in
the clean energy transition? Are Americans in better shape to pay off
debt than before the pandemic? And, does anyone really need an AI

ready for possible oil export curbs after Trump election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Iran has made plans to sustain its oil
production and exports and is ready for possible oil restrictions from a
Trump administration in the U.S., Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad said on
Wednesday, according to the oil ministry’s news website Shana. </p>
<p>In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015
nuclear pact with Iran and re-imposed sanctions that hurt Iran’s oil
sector, with production dropping to 2.1 million barrels per day, or bpd,
during his presidency. </p>
<p>“Required measures have been taken. I will not go into detail but our
colleagues within the oil sector have taken measures to deal with the
restrictions that will occur and there is no reason to be concerned,”
Paknejad said. </p>
<p>In recent years, Iranian oil production has rebounded to around 3.2
million barrels per day according to the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a member. </p>
<p>Iranian oil exports have climbed this year to near multi-year highs
of 1.7 million bpd despite U.S. sanctions.  </p>
<p>Chinese refiners buy most of its supply. Beijing says it doesn’t
recognize unilateral U.S. sanctions.</p>

overdose deaths down, giving experts hope for enduring decline</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have
continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained
improvement in the persistent epidemic. </p>
<p>There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that
ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention data released Wednesday. That’s down 14% from the estimated
113,000 for the previous 12-month period. </p>
<p>“This is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose
mortality numbers,” said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher
who studies overdose trends. </p>
<p>Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of
opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids
like heroin and — more recently — illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had
indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday
showed that the downward trend has kept going. </p>
<p>Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when
U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go
down, only to rise again, Marshall noted. </p>
<p>“This seems to be substantial and sustained,” Marshall said. “I think
there’s real reason for hope here.” </p>
<p>Experts aren’t certain about the reasons for the decline, but they
cite a combination of possible factors. </p>
<p>One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction
treatment was hard to get, and people were socially isolated — with no
one around to help if they overdosed. </p>
<p>“During the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose
deaths that it’s only natural we would see a decrease,” said Farida
Ahmad of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. </p>
<p>Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning
of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts
to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone,
and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a
University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose
trends. </p>
<p>Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from
settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and
Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and
pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and
big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on
naloxone and other measures. </p>
<p>Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply.
Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally
manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it’s
affecting overdoses. </p>
<p>In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states.
Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington. </p>
<p>The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but
CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags
in getting death records to federal statisticians — particularly North
Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of
understaffing at the state medical examiner’s office. The CDC made
estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the
decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as
initial numbers suggest. </p>
<p>Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn’t detail
what’s happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted
the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing
disproportionately larger. </p>
<p>“We really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these
declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,” Marshall
said.</p>

id="birth-control-abortion-pill-requests-surge-since-trump-election">Birth
control, abortion pill requests surge since Trump election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time,
Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace
their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting
their tubes tied.</p>
<p>All of them said the election was the reason they were making these
choices now.</p>
<p>Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations
have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The
Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and
abortion pills say they’re seeing significant spikes in requests from
people who are stockpiling the medications — one saw a 966% increase in
sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours
after the election.</p>
<p>“I saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016” and after Roe
vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke
University in North Carolina. “But the patients seem more afraid this
time.”</p>
<p>Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more
restrictions on abortion pills, it’s unclear what — if much — will be
done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second
Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May
that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after
media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform
Truth Social that he “has never and will never” advocate for restricting
birth control and other contraceptives.</p>
<p>Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and
“restart” the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He
also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have
been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg
is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking
fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to
implant in the womb.</p>
<p>A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she
doesn’t want kids and is “just absolutely terrified of either forced
pregnancy or inability to access contraception.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more
of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency
contraception, telling her upfront that it’s “because of the upcoming
administration change.”</p>
<p>One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency
contraception since she’s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B,
the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a
vasectomy.</p>
<p>“We always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,”
said Zupko, 27. “But as the world has become scarier and scarier, we
realized we didn’t want to bring a child into that environment. And I
also have several health risks.”</p>
<p>Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception
online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through
telehealth — something that’s been happening even before the election,
but that some companies say has accelerated.</p>
<p>A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid
Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called
“advance provision” pills from September 2021 through April 2023 — with
requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but
before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had
their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban
abortion.</p>
<p>Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol
around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides
information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life
of four years.</p>
<p>Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600%
between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11,
the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception
and birth control offerings.</p>
<p>At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception
called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60
hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of
“value packs” of Restart — four doses instead of one — were up more than
7,000% in the past week.</p>
<p>“Morning after pills” are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder
Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency
contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the
health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said
they know these two things aren’t the same, but only 27% reported
knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some
of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing
this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth
control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first
place.</p>
<p>Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level
out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration “is not
focused on health care right away,” he said, “then I think it’ll go to
the back of people’s minds until it picks up in the media.”</p>

id="trumps-unexpected-pick-for-pentagon-chief-is-decorated-veteran-fox-news-host">Trump’s
unexpected pick for Pentagon chief is decorated veteran, Fox News
host</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — President-elect Donald Trump has made a largely unexpected
pick to run the world’s largest military, nominating Fox News host and
decorated veteran Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary.</p>
<p>Trump has picked someone who has no previous experience in government
or in running a large business. But the Army National Guard officer and
“Fox and Friends” weekend host has raised his profile through hinting at
several changes to the Defense Department.</p>
<p>Hegseth has said he opposes diversity, equity and inclusion programs,
or DEI, which he has called “woke.” He has questioned the role of women
in combat positions, all of which were opened to women by Secretary of
Defense Ash Carter in January 2016. Since then, women have earned
positions as Green Berets, Army Rangers and Navy combat-craft crewman
after completing the same grueling tests as men.</p>
<p>Hegseth, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard, authored the book “The
War on Warriors,” which blames the military’s DEI programs for its
recruiting crisis.</p>
<p>“There just aren’t enough lesbians from San Francisco who want to
join the 82nd Airborne. Not only do the lesbians not join, but those
very same ads turn off the young, patriotic, Christian men who have
traditionally filled our ranks,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The nominee has also hinted he could target military leaders,
including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General C.Q. Brown, to
push out those who have supported DEI programs.</p>
<p>“First of all, you’ve got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs”
and “any general that was involved, any general, admiral, whatever,” he
told podcast host Shawn Ryan earlier this year.</p>
<p>Hegseth served tours of duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay
as an infantry officer and has pushed to make the U.S. military more
lethal.</p>
<p>He received two Bronze Stars, two Army Commendation Medals and the
National Defense Service Medal with a Bronze Service Star. </p>
<p>Trump has praised his pick as “tough, smart and a true believer in
‘America First.’” </p>
<p>Hegseth’s nomination will need to be confirmed by a Senate majority.
Republicans currently hold the majority by at least three seats.</p>
<p>One former Pentagon official, who spoke to VOA on condition of
anonymity to discuss a nomination before a Senate vote, praised
Hegseth’s dedication to American troops and veterans.</p>
<p>“He will fight for them because he really cares,” the former official
said.</p>
<p>Other national security officials, who also spoke to VOA on condition
of anonymity, said they were surprised by the pick.</p>
<p>After Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida was chosen to be Trump’s
national security adviser, many had expected the secretary of defense
position to be filled by one of the established national security
heavy-hitters in the Republican party, such as U.S. Representative Mike
Rogers of Alabama, who chairs the House Armed Services committee, or a
Senate Armed Services committee member such as Joni Ernst of Iowa or Tom
Cotton of Arkansas. Both are veterans.</p>
<p>The Defense Department oversees more than 2.5 million active-duty and
National Guard troops and has a budget that is expected to exceed $800
billion this year.</p>
<p>Trump had a rocky relationship with defense secretaries in his first
administration. His first secretary of defense, retired General Jim
Mattis, resigned in protest of Trump’s treatment of allies and his
decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. His other
Senate-confirmed secretary of defense, Mark Esper, has called the
president-elect “unfit for office.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the election, Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan that his
“biggest mistake” in his first term was appointing “bad people,”
including “neocons.”</p>
<p>Hegseth was the executive director for Concerned Veterans for
America, a group funded by the Koch brothers that advocated greater
privatization of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>He was reportedly under consideration to run the Department of
Veterans Affairs in the first Trump administration.</p>

<h2 id="climate-tech-companies-plan-for-survival-under-trump">Climate
Tech Companies Plan For Survival Under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ4OTcxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDAxNTA0MH0.KXQMa3LwtMmHfjTKbY516nuztwixSuoUiAY-EghDp-4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A mere two years ago, climate world was awash in optimism as the tax
credits in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act and other
Biden-era legislation opened up exciting opportunities for climate tech
companies. Now, Trump has said he wants to repeal the IRA in its
entirety and “terminate” all of its unspent funds. So what becomes of
the crop of startups that were either born directly out of or buoyed by
IRA incentives and other positive policy developments?
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a look at a few examples. First there’s Crux, a marketplace
for the transferable clean energy tax credits unlocked by the IRA.
There’s also Watershed, a $1.8 billion software startup that helps
businesses track and reduce their carbon emissions. And there’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/quilt-heat-pump-on-sale-date" target="_self"><u>Quilt</u></a>,
which makes a sleek, small, and expensive electric heat pump.
</p>
<p>
If they’re worried about what will happen to their business under a
Republican trifecta, they’re certainly not talking about it. In the week
since the election I’ve gotten used to hearing a couple primary
refrains. One: Everyone obviously wants to create and invest in tech
that can weather changing political tides and compete on market
fundamentals alone. And two: Red states disproportionately benefit from
the IRA.
</p>
<p>
Crux, for example, generates revenue by charging transaction fees for
the tax credits that are bought and sold on its platform, thus tying its
business model to these tax credits’ continued existence. Since the
startup began facilitating transactions last year, however, CEO Alfred
Johnson told me the market has been dominated by credits associated with
solar, wind, and advanced manufacturing, none of which are thought to be
at a particularly high risk of deletion.
</p>
<p>
Who knows with Trump, though. There’s certainly no doubt that the
priorities of his administration will be quite different from those of
Biden’s, and that gives rise to a lot of what-ifs. For example: If Trump
guts the Department of Energy overall, eliminating or hollowing out the
Loan Programs Office and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations,
presumably far less clean tech requiring huge infrastructure investment
will get built. And that will mean fewer tax credits to trade.
</p>
<p>
Johnson agrees, calling this “a real cause for concern” for emergent
technologies overall. So essentially, Johnson is banking on there
being<em> </em>enough<em> </em>bipartisan support for enough<em>
</em>tax credits and enough new project buildout that the market keeps
humming right along, even as specific energy priorities change.
</p>
<p>
“The number of times that Trump has talked about nuclear energy or
domestic manufacturing as big objectives of his campaign and
administration is extremely high,” Johnson noted. “And transferability
is already the mechanism by which you’ll drive additional dollars into
those markets.”
</p>
<p>
And then there’s Watershed, the unicorn software company founded in 2019
on the premise that global corporate sustainability reporting was on a
steady upwards trajectory, driven by pressure from customers and
investors as well as impending regulations, including domestic
<a href="https://watershed.com/blog/understanding-the-secs-new-carbon-disclosure-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
disclosure rules</u></a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now, it seems relatively safe to say that under Trump, those (already
long-delayed) rules will probably never

the light of day</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Watershed co-founder Taylor Francis told me that’s not as big a problem
as you might expect for a company that makes its money selling
emissions-tracking software to large companies. Why not? Europe and
California, mostly. Each has its own respective reporting requirements
that will go into effect in the next few years, he explained. In the EU,
it’s the
<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive</u></a>, which applies to all
medium-to-large companies in the region, plus any non-EU companies with
over €150 million in annual revenue there, while
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>California’s
climate disclosure law</u></a> applies to any company doing business in
the state that has at least $1 billion in global revenue.
</p>
<p>
“It is very hard to think about any large company that does not fall
into one of those two buckets,” Francis told me. “And those things are
unconnected from who’s in the White House.” Though the SEC rules would
have been a boon to Watershed’s business, Francis said that since
they’re already stuck in court
<a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/10-republican-states-challenge-final-sec-climate-disclosure-rule/709763/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due
to challenges</u></a> from Republican-led states, the company wasn’t
banking on federal climate disclosure policy to be enacted under
<em><em>either</em></em> administration.
</p>
<p>
A tax credit that
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supports
residential energy efficiency</u></a> could be in real danger though.
This credit makes things such as insulation, energy-efficient windows,
and heating and cooling systems such as heat pumps more affordable for
homeowners. And that, of course, could be bad news for companies working
in these spaces, including Quilt, which seeks to create
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/heat-pump-gradient-quilt-electric-air" target="_self"><u>the
Tesla of heat pumps</u></a>.” The current credit allows homeowners to
claim up to $2,000 on the purchase of their heat pump, but Quilt’s CEO
Paul Lambert told me that he doesn’t think this has made any real
difference in consumer uptake thus far.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a nice-to-have,” he said of the tax credit. “But if you asked me,
‘How many Quilt customers would not have purchased Quilt had that not
existed?’ I think the answer is zero.” Right now this high-performance
heat pump is only available in San Francisco, where many tech
enthusiasts have both money to spend and an entrepreneurial attitude
when it comes to early adoption. And while the upfront costs of heat
pumps are high, they eventually pay for themselves in energy savings —
though Lambert also acknowledged that as the company expands into more
markets, it will encounter more price-sensitive customers who may be put
off by the high sticker price.
</p>
<p>
Even if the energy efficiency tax credit gets nixed, heat pump adoption
could still be aided by another IRA provision, the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Home
Energy Rebates Program</u></a>, which provides low- to moderate-income
households with savings of up to $8,000 on heat pumps alone, with
additional money available for other electric appliances. These programs
are state-administered, and only 10 states plus Washington D.C. have
launched their programs so far. Once money gets disbursed, it will get
much trickier for Trump to eliminate these programs. But the many states
that are still preparing their applications or awaiting approval could
be at risk of getting their funding pulled.
</p>
<p>
Lambert chooses to see the bright side of an increased reliance on state
and local level policy. “A lot of states are going to feel like they
need to step up and pick up the ball where it may have been dropped,” he
told me, also noting that “a lot of the rebates we’re benefiting from
now at a local level and state level were made in reaction to the first
Trump presidency.”
</p>
<p>
It’s an optimistic sentiment that I’ve heard from investors, as well —
that there’s nothing as energizing as a climate foe in the White House
to motivate states and even philanthropists to pick up the slack. But at
the end of the day, there’s also nothing that quite replaces the
hundreds of billions the IRA poured into energy and climate initiatives,
and the trillions that it’s set to unlock in
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/memorandum-from-deputy-secretary-wally-adeyemo-inflation-reduction-act-year-1#:~:text=Our%20strategy%2C%20by%20contrast%2C%20uses,America%20for%20renewable%20energy%20technology." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>additional

Senate Republicans choose Senator John Thune as majority leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Republicans on Wednesday chose Senator John Thune to
serve as majority leader when they retake control of the chamber next
year.  </p>
<p>In a secret ballot, the South Dakota senator beat Senators John
Cornyn and Rick Scott to assume the mantle of Republican leadership that
Mitch McConnell has held for the past 18 years.</p>
<p>Thune told reporters the November 5 election was a mandate from the
American people “to work with this president on an agenda that unwinds a
lot of the damage of the Biden Harris Schumer agenda and puts in place
new policies that will move our country forward in a different
direction.”  </p>
<p>The 63-year-old Thune was elected to the Senate in 2004 and currently
holds the Number 2 spot in Republican leadership, serving as minority
whip. He is perceived as a more mainstream choice than Scott, a
hard-line conservative and close ally of President-elect Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>McConnell said in a statement that Thune’s “election is a clear
endorsement of a consummate leader. The confidence our colleagues have
placed in John’s legislative experience and political skill is well
deserved.”</p>
<p>Thune received 23 votes to Cornyn’s 15 and Scott’s 13. He will serve
as Senate majority leader for at least the next two years.</p>
<p>Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the 100-person U.S.
Senate. Votes in the Pennsylvania Senate race are still being
counted.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with him,” current Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer said in a statement.  “We’ve done many bipartisan things
here in the Senate together and I hope that continues. As you know, I
strongly believe that bipartisanship is the best and often the only way
to get things done in the Senate.”</p>
<p>Trump has floated the idea of bypassing the normal hearing process
for Cabinet appointees, a significant departure from the Constitutional
role of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“The Senate has an advise and consent role in the Constitution, so we
will do everything we can to process his nominations quickly and get
them installed in their position so they can begin to implement his
agenda,” Thune told reporters after his election.</p>
<p>Trump endorsed Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Wednesday, saying
he should serve as leader in the 119th Congress. With vote counting
still underway in some states, Republicans hold a slim majority over
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Trump also had a unified government, with Republican control of both
the Senate and the House, during the first two years of his first term
as president.</p>

Xi to meet in Lima on sidelines of APEC summit in Peru</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet
November 16 on the sidelines of the 2024 Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation, or APEC summit in Lima, Peru, the White House announced
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The meeting follows the leaders’ last in-person engagement a year ago
on the sidelines of the APEC summit in California, and their 2022
meeting in Bali on the sidelines of the G20 summit.</p>
<p>Biden and Xi are expected to revisit areas of cooperation,
particularly the resumption of military-to-military contacts, efforts to
combat the global fentanyl crisis and nascent work to deal with the
risks of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, a senior administration said in
a briefing with reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. president will also express “deep concern” over Beijing’s
support for Moscow’s war against Ukraine, and the deployment of North
Korean troops to aid Russia, said the official, who requested anonymity
to speak on the upcoming meeting. The official said Biden will also
reiterate his “longstanding concern” over China’s “unfair trade policies
and non-market economic practices” that hurt American workers.</p>
<p>The official added Biden will raise Chinese cyber-attack efforts on
U.S. civilian critical infrastructure as well as Beijing’s increased
military activities around Taiwan and the South China Sea while also
underscoring the importance of respect for human rights.</p>
<p>The meeting is likely to be the last between Biden and Xi ahead of
the incoming administration of Donald Trump in January. The
president-elect has appointed ardent China critics in key foreign policy
positions that could lead to a more confrontational U.S. posture toward
Beijing. They include Republican Congressman Mike Waltz as Trump’s pick
for national security adviser and Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of
state.</p>
<p>Whatever the next administration decides, they’re going to need to
find ways to manage the “tough, complicated relationship” between the
U.S. and China, the official said in response to a question from
VOA.</p>
<p>“Russia, cross-strait issues, the South China Sea and cyber are areas
the next administration is going to need to think about carefully,
because those are areas of deep policy difference with China, and I
don’t expect that will disappear,” the official said.</p>
<p>Xi is also likely anticipating what the Trump administration plans to
do about global trade, particularly whether he will enact promises to
impose steep tariffs on all Chinese goods.</p>

<h2 id="biden-trump-pledge-peaceful-transfer-of-power-in-january">Biden,
Trump pledge peaceful transfer of power in January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned triumphantly to Washington
on Wednesday, pledging a smooth transition of power in January as he met
for two hours at the White House with his longtime political rival,
President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“It was a substantive meeting,” White House spokeswoman Karine
Jean-Pierre told reporters. “They discussed important national security
and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world.”</p>
<p>Biden invited Trump for the traditional visit — a show of the coming
Jan. 20 peaceful transfer of power in American democracy between the
current U.S. leader and the incoming chief executive. It was Trump’s
first visit to the White House since his first presidential term ended
in January 2021.</p>
<p>The two men sat in front of a roaring fireplace in the Oval Office
ahead of their private talks and traded niceties in a peaceful
tableau.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to having a smooth transition and we’re looking
forward to talking about some of that today,” Biden said.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much,” Trump replied. “Politics is tough and in many
cases it’s not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I
appreciate very much a transition so smooth — it will be as smooth as it
can get — and I very much appreciate that, Joe. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” Biden responded.</p>
<p>Watch related video by Anita Powell:</p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden joined her husband in greeting the
president-elect upon his arrival at the White House. The White House
said she gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his
wife, Melania, and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the
transition.</p>
<p>The former first lady, who lived in the White House from 2017 to 2021
during her husband’s first presidency, did not accompany him to
Washington and has not indicated whether she plans to move into the
White House again when he takes office.</p>
<p>Biden, a Democrat, had sought to defeat Trump, a Republican, for a
second time in the Nov. 5 election, but ended his campaign in July after
faltering badly in a debate against Trump. Biden quickly endorsed Vice
President Kamala Harris to succeed him, but Trump swept through seven
political battleground states in the election and easily defeated
her.</p>
<p>When Biden defeated Trump in 2020, Trump offered no White House
invitation to meet him ahead of the inauguration and left Washington two
hours before Biden’s swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump, who to this day claims falsely that he was cheated out of
winning the 2020 election by vote fraud, was the first president to not
witness his successor’s inauguration since Andrew Johnson skipped the
swearing-in of Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. Biden has said he plans to
attend Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p>Trump also met with Republican lawmakers in the House of
Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber in
the current Congress and are nearing a slight majority control in the
Congress set to be sworn in Jan. 3, but the outcome of more than a dozen
House elections remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Trump has moved quickly to fill his nascent administration with
Republican officials who have been the most politically loyal to him in
the four years he has been out of office.</p>
<p>In his latest announcements Wednesday, Trump named Florida Senator
Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top diplomat; Florida
Representative Matt Gaetz as attorney general, the top law enforcement
position in the government, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Hawaii
Democratic congresswoman turned Republican advocate for the
president-elect, as director of national intelligence.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a veteran
of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to be his next defense
secretary.</p>
<p>The choice of Hegseth was outside the norm of those usually named as
the Pentagon leader. But he was a vocal supporter of Trump during his
first term, embracing his “America First” agenda of trying to withdraw
U.S. troops from abroad and often taking up the cause of combat veterans
accused of war crimes.</p>
<p>Trump has also announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as his
choice for Homeland Security chief and picked John Ratcliffe as the
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice
presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked
first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join
him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained
Trump stalwarts as he won the election.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth director of national intelligence,
serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a
rocky confirmation process.</p>
<p>Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and
entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek
Ramaswamy will lead what Trump called the Department of Government
Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance
to “drive large-scale structural reform” of the federal government.</p>
<p>The acronym for the new agency, DOGE, is a nod to Musk’s favorite
cryptocurrency, dogecoin.</p>
<p>Other notable picks by Trump include William McGinley as White House
counsel, Florida congressman Michael Waltz as national security adviser
and Thomas Homan, Trump’s former acting immigration chief, to be “border
czar” to head efforts to deport undocumented migrants, possibly millions
of them, who are living in the United States.</p>

According to the latest CPI numbers out on Wednesday, prices rose 0.2%
in October and were 2.6% higher than they were a year ago. But wage
growth continues to outpace inflation. As Americans are seeing a rise in
disposable income, we’ll look at how it’s helping drive a significant
improvement in consumer confidence and spending. Also on the show, we’ll
explain the role federal income tax has traditionally played in the
federal budget.

id="future-uncertain-for-chinese-migrants-without-us-visa-under-trump">Future
uncertain for Chinese migrants without US visa under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — The price of entering the U.S. through the southern
border is 250,000 yuan or close to $35,000, said Xiao Jing, a woman in
her 30s who is to paying that amount to try to enter the U.S. without a
visa. She is using a pseudonym due to the sensitivity of the issue.</p>
<p>“I was introduced by an acquaintance who had been successful
[entering the U.S. illegally through the southern border] to help me
apply for a Japanese visa and arrange the pickup service after I arrive
in Mexico,” she told VOA. The person who will pick her up in Mexico will
then help her cross into the U.S.</p>
<p>Xiao worked as a clerk in a small company in the Chinese city of
Chongqing. But because of China’s economic downturn in recent years, she
said her boss first defaulted on wages, then laid off many people,
including her.</p>
<p>“At my age, it’s hard to find a job, and I don’t like the political
atmosphere in the country,” she said.</p>
<p>If she applied for a U.S. visa, Xiao said, she would have to wait for
an interview and her assets and income would be scrutinized. She chose
plan B: obtaining a visa to Japan, then buying a plane ticket, although
she has not decided to which city.</p>
<p>“My agent [for helping to get a travel visa] told me that if I was
afraid, I should stay in China. But I still want to give it a try,” she
told VOA.</p>
<p>A woman who only calls herself “Lisa” is a China-based “agent” who is
helping Chinese migrants with their attempts to cross into the U.S.
without documentation. Because of her work, she does not want to give
her real name and be identified by the police.</p>
<p>She told VOA she received an unusually large number of inquiries from
people in China in the past few days, and she advised them to get on the
road as soon as possible and enter the U.S. before President-elect
Donald Trump takes office.</p>
<p>One of Trump’s top campaign promises was to make it tougher for
migrants to enter the United States unlawfully.</p>
<p>“The day I take office, the migrant invasion ends, and the
restoration of our country begins,” said Trump in a October 31 campaign
rally in Henderson, Nevada.</p>
<p>He also singled out migrants from China during an April 13 speech in
Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, describing them as “military age and they
mostly are men. And it sounds like to me, are they trying to build a
little army in our country?”</p>
<p>Lisa said people from China have not stopped wanting to enter the
U.S., because China’s economy and lack of freedom of speech have not
improved.</p>
<p>She has created several Telegram groups that discuss illegal
immigration. Lisa said the membership of those chat groups has been
increasing daily.</p>
<p>Lisa said, currently, the Chinese have had no problems entering
Mexico. She showed VOA the entry stamps in the passport pages of several
of her clients.</p>
<p>Her recommended route is to fly to Tijuana, Mexico, and climb the
border wall into San Diego, California. San Diego is also close to Los
Angeles, where there is a large Chinese population. She observed that it
is more difficult to enter the U.S. now, and people are kept in
immigration detention centers longer than a year ago.</p>
<p>Wang Zhongwei, a 33-year-old asylum-seeker and activist, well-known
among the Chinese migrants, told VOA that people had been discussing new
routes through either Cuba or Bolivia for months, but very few people
were able to reach the U.S. via these routes.</p>
<p>“I have not been in contact with anyone taking this route through
Cuba, and we are now in contact with a much smaller group of people [who
are trying to come to the U.S. through the southern border] than before.
Almost everyone who entered the country flew from Japan to Mexico and
then crossed the wall into the U.S.,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Guo Bin from Guangxi Province arrived in the U.S. through the
southern border last year with his 12-year-old daughter. He said in the
last two to three months, fewer people have tried to take the journey
from China through Turkey, then Ecuador and then up through Central
America and Mexico to the U.S.</p>
<p>Guo has been listening to the chatter on social media channels within
the communities of Chinese migrants who have crossed or attempted to
cross the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>“The people who entered the U.S. border now are the ones stranded on
the road in the past two or three months, not the ones who just set off
from China. Many people are now stranded in Mexico, Ecuador or Turkey.
Some have run out of money halfway through, and some have been deceived
by snakeheads [human traffickers], so they have to stay in the local
area and work and continue the journey after getting enough money by
working for a few months,” he said.</p>
<p>The number of migrants from China that U.S. border agents have
encountered at the southern border has been declining since December
2023 when it reached close to 6,000 people. In September, the number of
Chinese encounters dropped to just over 1,300, according to U.S. Customs
and Border Protection statistics.</p>
<p>The December high is consistent with overall undocumented migrant
numbers described by the Biden administration as “the highest level of
encounters between ports of entry in history.”</p>
<p>In June, Biden issued an executive order that temporarily restricted
asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border whenever the number of
migrants crossing unlawfully or without authorization reaches a daily
average of 2,500.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has also stepped up its border enforcement
with checkpoints on major roads and increased patrols of border
crossings into the U.S.</p>
<p>Guo said comments on social media from the Chinese migrant community
revealed some of the Chinese who did manage to enter the U.S. without
visas were deported.</p>
<p>“Some of them were [repatriated] because they are members of the
Communist Party, and they might not pass the interview,” Guo said.</p>
<p>In July, the U.S. announced the first large charter flight since
2018, deporting Chinese nationals to China.</p>
<p>“We will continue to enforce our immigration laws and remove
individuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States,”
Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said. “People should
not believe the lies of smugglers.”</p>
<p>News of Trump’s election victory has frightened many Chinese migrants
in the U.S., Wang told VOA.</p>
<p>“The moment the election results came out, the immigrant group’s
chats turned into heated discussions, and many people began to worry.
I’m a little worried about what the new policy will be,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump’s “rhetoric of mass deportations has affected all those who
have not gotten legal status, including those who crossed the southern
border illegally and those who came with a legal visa and now apply for
asylum,” Wang said.</p>
<p>Asylum applications typically have two steps: a pretrial hearing with
an average waiting time of about three years and an individual hearing
with a waiting time of less than five years.</p>
<p>At present, Wang has passed the pretrial hearing, and his personal
hearing is scheduled for February. His case is moving relatively faster
and smoother than other Chinese migrants, said immigration lawyers, but
he does not know what changes may occur under the new Trump
administration.</p>

of that is because Elon Musk’s company is likely to

stress-free switch away from gasoline.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, well, <em><em>Elon</em></em>. Though 35% of respondents
to a Heatmap poll last winter said the controversial and erratic
executive made them
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/elon-musk-tesla-poll-ev-buyers" target="_self"><u>more

But what about all those people who purchased Teslas before Musk went

bought this before we knew Elon was crazy</u></a>.” As you might expect,
business is booming.
</p>
<p>
Last night, I caught up with Hiller about his unexpected success. Our
conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How did you begin making anti-Elon Musk stickers?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I started making stickers on my own before the Elon sticker. I work at
an aquarium, so I did a lot of fish stickers. I always had an interest
in making stickers — I knew how to make them, and how to put the designs
and cute phrases on them.
</p>
<p>
The point came in maybe February or January of 2023. I had been wanting
to buy a Tesla, but at that point, I started to notice how far off the
rails Elon had been going. When he bought Twitter, he started extreme
censoring of information, taking verification marks off <em><em>The New
York Times</em></em> and things like that to sow discontent,
disinformation, and push his agenda. And it was ugly. I couldn’t believe
this man was using his power like this, and I immediately did not want
to support him in any way. I figured, there’s no way
<em><em>I’m</em></em> buying a Tesla — but there have got to be so many
people who are so embarrassed to be repping him on the streets driving
their Teslas and who want to completely disavow this guy. Because I know
I would want to sell mine immediately after I saw what he was doing.
</p>
<p>
So I made the first sticker, which said, “I bought this before we knew
Elon was crazy.” I printed up a very small run at first and just threw
it in my shop. It took a while for the first sale, but after it got
rolling, some people started posting pictures. It
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/169m9i7/me_irl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>went
viral</u></a> a couple of times and I would see a burst of sales, and
then it would quiet down. I would be selling five to seven a day, and
then suddenly, there would be 50 a day because someone else talked about
it on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
And now, at this point, it’s gone insane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have your sales gone up since the election?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely. Unbelievably.
</p>
<p>
There were major points when the sales spiked beyond anything that had
happened before. The first time was when Elon went on stage with Trump
at one of the rallies, and that solidified what everybody already knew:
that he was in the tank for Trump, and he was going to put his full
fortune behind getting the guy elected.
</p>
<p>
Then after the election, there was another huge bunch of sales because
people were like, “Oh my God, this guy is now going to have a part in
this government.” This was so in-your-face and so disgusting — he’s just
filling Trump’s coffers with his money in exchange for position and
power and influence. And it showed in the sales that other people
thought so, too: I must have sold probably 250 or 300 that day, and it’s
been steady ever since. I can barely keep up. My full-time job is at the
aquarium, and I come home and pack stickers until 11 p.m. It’s just me
and my wife doing it all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can you give me a ballpark of how many you’ve sold?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Definitely over 10,000. I think today we’re at about 180 [per day] — and
that’s across all my stickers, not just the anti-Elon sticker. But it’s
been around 100-plus every day for weeks now. It’s rough.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which is the most popular design?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The most popular is the OG, the “I bought this before we knew Elon was
crazy.” It’s the only one that I have that is a traditional long bumper
sticker, rectangular. And I’m a little upset that it’s the most popular
because it’s the hardest one to ship because of the odd-size envelopes.
For all the other ones, it’s easier. But that’s the most popular one by
far.
</p>
<p>
It’s currently the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Bumper-Stickers/zgbs/automotive/268880011" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No. 4
best-selling bumper sticker on Amazon</u></a>. It had been #1 at a few
different points. At one point it was beating both Trump and Kamala
stickers. And I was like, “That’s insane. People hate Elon more than
they love Trump or Kamala?”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Have you sold to any Cybertruck owners, as far as you’re
aware?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have no idea. I don’t think so — I mean, everyone knew he was crazy by
the time the Cybertruck came out. People buying the Cybertruck are all
in.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I
</strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtXwN-ipQXc/?img_index=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>saw
on Instagram</strong></u></a><strong> that you dropped off some stickers
at a Tesla dealership?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That was a while ago. I didn’t take stickers; I believe I had a key
chain at that point. I dropped them around the store just for the heck
of it, to try to drum up some interest in anti-Elon sentiment. Maybe
it’d find the right person, you never know. I wish I had more time to
focus on social media, but I just don’t.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you have any more anti-Elon sticker design plans?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s one that’s a little more general, and it just says,
“<a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1822683937/no-more-billionaires-bumper-sticker-anti?click_key=f7747edd938ca8dab83c03fd8b792675cc063f0e%3A1822683937&click_sum=62bc04f1&ref=shop_home_active_19&frs=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No
more billionaires</u></a>.” Elon is the main problem: He’s probably the
worst billionaire, but he’s not the only problem. So maybe that sticker
will end up on a Tesla, too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will you keep making your fish stickers now that your anti-Elon
business has taken off?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. I have the ideas banked, I just don’t bother printing them at this
point. There’s no point — I’m swamped with what I’ve got. But yeah,
absolutely. If I have a really good one, I’ll print it for the aquarium,
but not my own personal store. At this point, I’m all Elon, all the
time.

government worker charged with leaking classified documents on Israel’s
plans to strike Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A man who worked for the U.S. government has been
charged with leaking classified information assessing Israel’s earlier
plans to attack Iran, according to court papers filed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The man, identified as Asif William Rahman, was arrested by the FBI
this week in Cambodia and was due to make his first court appearance in
Guam.</p>
<p>He was indicted last week in U.S. court in Virginia on two counts of
willful transmission of national defense information — felony charges
that can can carry significant prison sentences.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Rahman had a lawyer or which
federal agency employed him, but officials say he had top secret
security clearance.</p>
<p>The charges stem from the documents, attributed to the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, appearing
last month on a channel of the Telegram messaging app. The documents
noted that Israel was still moving military assets in place to conduct a
military strike in response to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile
attack on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Israel carried out a retaliatory attack on multiple sites in Iran in
late October.</p>
<p>The documents were sharable within the “Five Eyes,” which are the
United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The New York Times was first to report his arrest.</p>

<strong></strong>Global fossil fuel emissions are projected to rise
again this year, and there is “no sign” of a peak,

to the Global Carbon Project</a>. Carbon dioxide emissions from burning
oil, gas, and coal in 2024 will hit about 37.4 billion metric tons, up
0.8% from 2023. Total CO2 emissions – including from land-use changes
like deforestation and wildfires – will rise to 41.6 billion metric
tons, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year. Projected emissions
vary on a regional level: China’s are expected to rise by 0.2%, while
U.S. emissions are expected to fall 0.6%. India’s will be up 4.6%, while
the EU’s will be down by nearly 4%. Notably, emissions from land-use
changes have been falling for a decade but are set to rise this year.
And then there’s this sobering reminder: “Current levels of
technology-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (excluding nature-based means
such as reforestation) only account for about one-millionth of the CO2
emitted from fossil fuels.” The research team behind the project
estimates that the 1.5 degrees Celsius target will be breached in six
years.

The rollbacks are coming. Donald Trump’s incoming administration is
expected to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, weaken
the Environmental Protection Agency’s rules for power plants and
tailpipe pollution, and — potentially — rewrite or repeal big swaths of
the Inflation Reduction Act. Each of those actions would seem to provide
an opening for the world’s No. 1 polluter — China — to assert global
leadership and zip ahead in the next generation of clean energy
technology.

</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> While we have no idea what is in Trump’s
head, he does have a set of voices around him. To the degree that you
can see and briefly summarize those camps, Jeremy, what, what do you …
What is he going to be hearing? What are the dominant intellectual
threads, or self-interested economic-motivated threads that he’s likely
to hear from different parts of his coalition?<br/> <br/> <strong>Jeremy
Wallace: </strong>I would say three different camps. There will be as
many as different advisors, but I think summarizing it into three
different camps is helpful. There’s a Lighthizer camp that … Lightizer
comes out of the steel industry, and thinking about domestic steel
manufacturing and national security. So that’s a camp, and that’s a
tariff, tariff, tariff world. We can China decouple in order to reduce
their power.<br/> <br/> There’s a Musk camp, who is probably just
singular, that is simultaneously extremely kind of right-wing in its
orientation, but also runs a multi-trillion-dollar company that is
principally Chinese-produced, and Chinese demand — not only, by any
means, but is a major portion of that business. And then there is the,
there are the Wall Street billionaires that we’re talking about as
Treasury Secretary, where there is an interest in continued economic
relations and not destroying U.S. credibility to pay its own debts, to
make sure that the economy continues to run. <br/> <br/> And I think all
of those would have very different views about what U.S.-China policy
should be. There’s a Pentagon wing, right? There’s all kinds of other
voices, as well. But I think from Trump world, I think those are
probably the three principal voices that he actually cares about. And I
don’t know what the right … I don’t know what the policies will be,
other than my guess is that there would be a lot of cycling between
those three different views.

Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate’s Democratic majority began a crusade on Tuesday to
confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Joe Biden as
possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Republican Donald Trump could
fill after taking office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on Jan. 3, the
Senate on Tuesday held a confirmation vote on one of Biden’s judicial
nominees - former prosecutor April Perry - for the first time since
Trump won the Nov. 5 presidential election. The Senate voted 51-44 in
favor of her becoming a U.S. district court judge in Illinois.</p>
<p>All told, Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are
awaiting Senate confirmation votes. Sixteen have already have been
reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final
confirmation vote by the full Senate. Another 14 nominees are awaiting
committee review.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution assigns to the Senate the power to confirm a
president’s nominees for life-tenured seats on the federal
judiciary.</p>
<p>“We are going to get as many done as we can,” Democratic Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trump made 234 judicial appointments during his first four years in
office, the second most of any president in a single term, and succeeded
in moving the judiciary rightward - including building a 6-3
conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court with three
appointees.</p>
<p>Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges. Since the beginning of
his presidency in 2021, the Senate has confirmed 214 Biden judicial
nominees, including liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
About two-thirds were women, and the same share were racial
minorities.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats are under pressure to swiftly confirm the remaining
nominees, along with any new picks Biden may name in the waning weeks of
his presidency.</p>
<p>How many nominees Senate Democrats will be able to confirm remains to
be seen. Trump in a social media post on Sunday called on the Senate to
halt approving Biden’s nominees, saying, “Democrats are looking to ram
through their Judges.”</p>
<p>Billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk on Tuesday wrote on social media
that “activist” judicial nominees are “bad for the country.” Mike Davis,
a Trump ally at the conservative judicial advocacy group Article III
Project, in another post urged Senate Republicans to vote down all
judicial appointments until January.</p>
<p>“The American people voted for monumental change,” Davis wrote on
social media last week. “Grind the Senate to a halt.”</p>
<p>Current Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell’s office declined
comment. McConnell has consistently opposed Biden’s nominees and, as
majority leader, was instrumental in getting Trump’s previous nominees
confirmed.</p>
<p>Trump’s judicial appointees have been involved in major decisions
welcomed by conservatives including Supreme Court rulings rolling back
abortion rights, widening gun rights, rejecting race-conscious
collegiate admissions and limiting the power of federal regulatory
agencies.</p>
<p>Judicial nominees require a simple majority for confirmation.
Democrats currently hold a slim 51-49 majority, meaning that they can
ill afford any defections or absences if Republicans show up in force to
oppose Biden’s nominees during the chamber’s post-election “lame duck”
session.</p>
<p>West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with
the Democrats, has said he would not vote for any nominee who does not
garner at least one Republican vote. Must-pass legislation like a
spending bill to avert a government shutdown also may consume precious
time during the session.</p>
<p>‘Every possible nominee’</p>
<p>Biden’s allies have said a concerted push to confirm his remaining
nominees would allow him to build on his legacy of helping to diversify
a federal bench long dominated by white men.</p>
<p>He is not done nominating judges. On Friday, Biden announced his
first post-election nominee, Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who after
unsuccessfully running in the 2021 Democratic primary to be Manhattan
district attorney was picked for a job as a federal district judge in
New York.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and
chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he “aims to
confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress.”</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Monday noted that during
Trump’s first term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 18 judges
after Biden had won the 2020 election but before he took office.</p>
<p>Pending nominees include five to the influential federal appeals
courts. Republicans said before the election that they had the votes to
block two of them: Adeel Mangi, who would become the first Muslim
federal appellate judge, and North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park,
who unsuccessfully defended the race-conscious admissions policies
before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>There are several others nominated to serve as trial court judges
like Perry, a former prosecutor now working at Chicago-headquartered GE
HealthCare who would join the bench in Illinois. Biden nominated her to
a judgeship in April after her prior nomination to become Chicago’s top
federal prosecutor was blocked by Republican Senator JD Vance.</p>
<p>Vance began placing a hold on Biden’s nominees to the U.S. Justice
Department in 2023 after Special Counsel Jack Smith secured the first of
two federal indictments against Trump, who subsequently picked the
senator as his vice presidential running mate.</p>

<h2 id="biden-israeli-president-stress-need-to-end-conflicts">Biden,
Israeli president stress need to end conflicts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday hosted Israel’s president while
President-elect Donald Trump has separately held multiple phone calls
recently with Israel’s head of government, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. These parallel talks have focused on the conflicts in Gaza
and Lebanon and hopes for the release of hostages held by Hamas. VOA
White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.</p>

<h2 id="hezbollah-hamas-down-but-not-out-us-says">Hezbollah, Hamas down
but not out, US says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Israel’s war against Hezbollah and Hamas, while
inflicting considerable damage, has yet to strike a crippling blow to
either of the Iran-backed terror groups, according to a top U.S.
counterterrorism official.</p>
<p>The acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center
(NCTC) said Tuesday that the impact of Israeli intelligence operations,
along with repeated military airstrikes and ground offensives in Lebanon
and Gaza, have severely diminished the ability of both groups to launch
new attacks on Israel.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that both groups remain resilient, and in the case
of Hezbollah, retain significant capabilities.</p>
<p>“Before the conflict, they [Hezbollah] had built up unprecedented
numbers of rockets and missiles and other munitions,” the NCTC’s Brett
Holmgren told an audience in Washington, adding that the Lebanese group
was starting at a “very strong point.”</p>
<p>And he said while Israeli strikes have decimated Hezbollah
leadership, the group’s ground forces in southern Lebanon “remain
somewhat intact.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Israel’s actions have done little to damage Hezbollah’s
reach beyond the Middle East.</p>
<p>“Their external capabilities have largely been untouched,” Holmgren
said, noting the U.S. and its allies are on alert for any indication
Hezbollah may seek to retaliate outside the region.</p>
<p>Hamas’ staying power</p>
<p>Hamas, which touched off the war in Gaza when it launched its October
7, 2023, terror attack that killed about 1,200 mostly Israeli civilians,
has also suffered greatly, according to the latest U.S. assessments.</p>
<p>“Militarily, they have been significantly diminished,” Holmgren said.
“They’re essentially morphing into an insurgent force on the
ground.”</p>
<p>Yet despite being forced to keep a low profile and resort to
hit-and-run-type tactics, U.S. intelligence sees few indications Hamas
has lost its appeal.</p>
<p>“Hamas has been able to recruit new members to its ranks and will
likely continue its ability to do so, so long as there is not another
viable political option on the ground for these disaffected young men in
Gaza to turn to,” Holmgren said. </p>
<p>“There has to be a more viable political actor on the ground in Gaza
to give these new recruits for Hamas, to give them a better option,” he
added.</p>
<p>Hamas, Hezbollah numbers</p>
<p>Prior to Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, U.S. intelligence
estimated that the U.S.-designated terror group had between 20,000 and
25,000 fighters, though some estimates put the number at 30,000 or more,
citing support from about a dozen other terror groups that had pledged
to fight under the Hamas banner.</p>
<p>Hezbollah, according to U.S. estimates, had about 40,000 fighters
with “state-like military capabilities.”</p>
<p>Holmgren on Tuesday did not elaborate on how many fighters from
either group had been eliminated. </p>
<p>Israeli officials, however, have said their forces have killed upward
of 14,000 Hamas fighters and more than 2,550 Hezbollah fighters.</p>
<p>The Israel Defense Forces earlier this month said it estimates that
about 80% of Hezbollah’s arsenal of medium- and short-range rockets has
been destroyed.</p>
<p>Health officials in Gaza have said the Israeli offensive there has
killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and
children.  </p>
<p>Lebanon’s Health Ministry said more than 3,000 people have been
killed during the conflict, though it does not differentiate between
civilians and Hezbollah fighters.</p>
<p>Terror spreading</p>
<p>There are growing concerns, though, that the death tolls in Lebanon
and Gaza are serving as a spark for other terror groups around the
world.</p>
<p>Less than a month after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, U.S.
counterterrorism officials warned that the event had begun to galvanize
other terror groups, including Islamic State and al-Qaida.</p>
<p>Holmgren said it appears the Hamas attack, combined with growing
political and economic turmoil, has in fact helped to reenergize other
groups.</p>
<p>Islamic State </p>
<p>“ISIS exploited reduced counterterrorism pressure last year to
recover and to rebuild as governments shifted attention and resources to
the conflict in Gaza,” Holmgren said, using an acronym for the Islamic
State terror group, also known as IS or Daesh.</p>
<p>Central Syria, he said, had become an epicenter for IS plotting
against the U.S. and the West, at large.  </p>
<p>And although a series of recent operations by the U.S. and the
U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces have again weakened IS, the group
continues to benefit from improved finances and resurgent media
campaigns, Holmgren said.</p>
<p>The IS affiliate in Afghanistan known as IS-Khorasan has likewise
shown resilience.</p>
<p>State Department officials, in a recent inspector general’s report,
admitted that serious questions remain about whether Afghanistan’s
ruling Taliban “have the will and capability to fully eliminate
terrorist safe havens or control the flow of foreign terrorist fighters
in and through Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>And although key elements of IS-Khorasan have fled Afghanistan for
Pakistan, there are fears the group may be poised for a resurgence.</p>
<p>“Sustained pressure will be needed to prevent the group from
expanding further,” Holmgren said.</p>
<p>Africa</p>
<p>Holmgren further warned that groups affiliating themselves with IS
and al-Qaida are also seeing their fortunes rise in Africa.</p>
<p>IS and al-Qaida attacks in West Africa and the Sahel alone are set to
surpass more than 3,000 by the end of the year, he said, doubling the
total number of attacks from 2021.</p>
<p>And it could get worse.</p>
<p>Holmgren said IS and al-Qaida affiliates have capitalized on turmoil
in countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and the Central African
Republic, where governments have turned to the Russian military and
Russian paramilitary groups to boost security.</p>
<p>The situation in Africa, “if left unchecked, could become a much more
acute long-term threat to U.S. interests,” he said. </p>
<p>Younger terrorists</p>
<p>U.S. counterterrorism analysts have also picked up on several other
trends that they say bear watching.</p>
<p>One is a propensity for younger people to join terror movements.</p>
<p>“The rising number of juveniles engaging in terrorism is a global
phenomenon, and it may well worsen in the near term as the effects of
the Israel-Hamas conflict take hold,” Holmgren said.</p>
<p>Vulnerable young people the world over, he said, are turning to
groups like IS for a sense of belonging and accomplishment.</p>
<p>“A lot of the propaganda — it’s easily accessible on the social media
platforms” he said. “A lot of it [is in] English.”</p>
<p>Iran and Trump</p>
<p>There is also concern about how Iran will respond to Israel’s
degradation of Hezbollah and Hamas, and to the reelection of former U.S.
President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials warned in the run-up to last week’s
election that Iran was engaged in a series of influence operations aimed
at hurting Trump’s chance of returning to power.</p>
<p>And late last week, the U.S. shed light on another in a series of
efforts by Tehran to assassinate the once and future president.</p>
<p>In the short term, Holmgren said, Iran could try to leverage its
proxy forces in Iraq and Syria to launch additional attacks against U.S.
interests and against Israel.</p>
<p>But he also expressed concern that Iran continues to play host to
al-Qaida’s de facto leader, Saif al-Adel.</p>
<p>“I won’t speculate on what the Iranian intentions are, but suffice to
say, it is unhelpful with his presence there,” Holmgren said Tuesday in
response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>Trump transition </p>
<p>Holmgren promised Tuesday to work with the incoming Trump
administration to keep the U.S. and its allies safe.</p>
<p>“I look forward to engaging with the Trump administration’s national
security team to conduct an orderly transition and to ensure that they
are ready on Day One to address a dynamic threat environment,” Holmgren
said.</p>
<p>“The U.S. counterterrorism community will be working diligently, as
they do each and every day, to keep threats at bay so that our democracy
may continue to shine as a beacon of freedom and hope in the world,” he
added.</p>

White House, Indonesia’s new leader straddles US-China rivalry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — President Joe Biden and President Prabowo Subianto met
Tuesday at the White House, marking the 75th anniversary of
U.S.-Indonesia relations, part of a multination visit by the newly
inaugurated leader of Southeast Asia’s largest economy.</p>
<p>“I will work very hard to strengthen Indonesia and United States
relationship,” said Prabowo, who goes by his first name.</p>
<p>Biden said he looks forward to deepening the Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership, the highest level among nontreaty allies, which the two
countries signed in 2023. “That includes deepening our security
cooperation,” he said before their meeting.</p>
<p>In brief remarks to the press, Biden twice raised an issue of concern
for Washington: freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. He said he
wanted to strengthen the U.S. partnership with Indonesia, “by advancing
[a] free and open Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>“We’ll discuss, also, global challenges, including in Gaza and the
South China Sea,” he said.</p>
<p>China’s nine-dash line</p>
<p>The White House meeting came days after Prabowo’s meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, where Indonesia and China
signed a series of agreements valued at about $10 billion and focusing
on infrastructure, green energy, digital technology and agriculture.</p>
<p>“In the present situation, geopolitical and geoeconomic, Indonesia
and China have become very close partners in many, many fields,” Prabowo
said.</p>
<p>One of the deals is to jointly develop fisheries, and oil and gas
exploration in waters around Indonesia’s Natuna Islands where China’s
“nine-dash line” marking its expansive claims in the South China Sea
overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<p>Critics say the agreement risks implicitly validating China’s
territorial claims in the South China Sea, which, according to the
United Nations, has no basis in international law.</p>
<p>VOA asked the White House whether Biden was specifically referring to
this deal in his meeting with Prabowo.</p>
<p>“We continue to encourage Indonesia to work with their legal experts
to make sure any agreement they make with the PRC [People’s Republic of
China] is in accordance with international law, especially the U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea,” said White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p>Beijing claims the major shipping route almost entirely, infringing
into the EEZs of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the
Philippines. All but Indonesia formally dispute the Chinese claim while
Taiwan makes a claim to the sea similar to Beijing’s.</p>
<p>“It’s a big deal for Indonesia,” as a non-claimant country in the
South China Sea dispute that supports the concept of a “free and open
Indo-Pacific,” said Klaus Heinrich Raditio, author on South China Sea
issues and lecturer at Indonesia’s Driyarkara School of Philosophy.
“People will question our position,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Foreign Ministry clarified Sunday that it remains firm
in rejecting China’s nine-dash line.</p>
<p>Beijing’s claim, Jakarta said, “does not comply” with the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and “therefore has no bearing”
on Indonesia’s sovereignty and jurisdiction over the North Natuna
Sea.</p>
<p>Jakarta’s agreement with Beijing highlights a “new phase of building
the China-Indonesia community with a shared future,” according to the
joint statement.</p>
<p>This reference supports “China’s vision of a new global order that is
anti-Western hegemony,” Raditio said.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether this language was an intentional signaling of a
geopolitical shift or merely an overlook from a new administration eager
to bolster ties with great powers. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington
has not responded to VOA’s queries.</p>
<p>“Most likely, it is a bureaucratic mistake,” Raditio said. “We put
too much attention on economic cooperation. How many investments that we
can attract from China? We kind of sideline other important issues.”</p>
<p>Prabowo’s outreach to Trump</p>
<p>Just as important to Jakarta as the White House meeting is Prabowo’s
outreach to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Jakarta is gearing up for
Trump’s new administration that begins in January.</p>
<p>“Wherever you are, I’m willing to fly to congratulate you personally,
sir,” Prabowo said in a call to Trump that was posted Monday on his
social media.</p>
<p>The Trump team has not responded to VOA’s queries on the
conversation.</p>
<p>U.S. foreign policy under Trump “may become more transactional and
more focused on elements related to U.S.-China, competition,” said
Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>“The downside risk of this as it relates to Southeast Asian
countries, is that it may limit some of the decision-making space they
have in their diplomatic affairs,” Natalegawa said.</p>
<p>Prabowo has voiced ambitions to raise Indonesia’s international
profile and has made early foreign policy moves, including a surprise
decision to join Southeast Asia’s largest economy to the BRICS bloc.</p>
<p>BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa, is a growing group of emerging economies seen as a counterweight
to the West. In October, BRICS added Indonesia as one of the group’s 13
new “partner countries.”</p>
<p>The move could be a shift away from the position taken by Prabowo’s
predecessor, Joko Widodo, who took in massive amounts of infrastructure
investments from Beijing but remained mostly nonaligned
geopolitically.</p>
<p>The White House visit marks a milestone for Prabowo, who was barred
from entering the U.S. under the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations
over his role in abducting activists of the 1998 “Reformasi” movement
that ousted President Suharto, Prabowo’s then father-in-law.</p>
<p>The Trump administration lifted the visa ban for then-Defense
Minister Prabowo, for his visit in 2020.</p>

id="jack-teixeira-who-leaked-pentagon-documents-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison">Jack
Teixeira, who leaked Pentagon documents, sentenced to 15 years in
prison</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>boston — A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a Massachusetts Air
National Guard member to 15 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to
leaking highly classified military documents about the war in
Ukraine. </p>
<p>Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty earlier this year to six counts of
willful retention and transmission of national defense information under
the Espionage Act following his arrest in the most consequential
national security case in years. Brought into court wearing an orange
jumpsuit, he showed no visible reaction as he was sentenced by U.S.
District Judge Indira Talwani. </p>
<p>Before being sentenced, he apologized for his actions. </p>
<p>“I wanted to say I’m sorry for all the harm that I brought and
caused,” Texeira said, referencing the “maelstrom” he caused to friends,
family, and anyone affected overseas.</p>
<p>“I understand all the responsibility and consequences fall upon my
shoulders alone and accept whatever that will bring,” he said, standing
as he addressed the judge. </p>
<p>Afterward, Teixeira hugged one of his attorneys and looked toward his
family and smiled before he was led out of court. </p>
<p>The security breach raised alarm over America’s ability to protect
its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to
scramble to try to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. The
leaks embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard
classified information and disciplined members found to have
intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira’s suspicious
behavior. </p>
<p>Earlier in Tuesday’s hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jared Dolan
argued that 200 months — or a little more than 16 1/2 years — was
appropriate given the “historic” damage caused by Teixeira’s conduct
that aided adversaries of the United States and hurt the country’s
allies. He also said that the recommendation by prosecutors would send a
message to anyone in the military who might consider similar conduct.
 </p>
<p>“It will be a cautionary tale for the men and women in the U.S.
military,” Dolan said. “They are going to be told this is what happens
if you break your promise, if you betray your country. … They will know
the defendant’s name. They will know the sentence the court
imposes.” </p>
<p>But Teixeira’s attorney Michael Bachrach told the judge in court
Tuesday that 11 years was sufficient. </p>
<p>“It is a significant, harsh and difficult sentence, one that will not
be easy to serve,” Bachrach said. “It will serve as an extreme deterrent
to anyone, particularly young servicemen. That is enough to keep them
deterred from committing serious conduct.” </p>
<p>‘His intent was to educate’</p>
<p>Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, had pleaded guilty in
March to six counts of the willful retention and transmission of
national defense information under the Espionage Act. That came nearly a
year after he was arrested in the most consequential national security
leak in years. </p>
<p>The 22-year-old admitted that he illegally collected some of the
nation’s most sensitive secrets and shared them with other users on the
social media platform Discord. </p>
<p>When Teixeira pleaded guilty, prosecutors said they would seek a
prison term at the high end of the sentencing range. But the defense
wrote in their sentencing memorandum earlier that the 11 years is a
“serious and adequate to account for deterrence considerations and would
be essentially equal to half the life that Jack has lived thus
far.” </p>
<p>His attorneys described Teixeira as an autistic, isolated individual
who spent most of his time online, especially with his Discord
community. They said his actions, though criminal, were never meant to
“harm the United States.” He also had no prior criminal record. </p>
<p>“Instead, his intent was to educate his friends about world events to
make certain they were not misled by misinformation,” the attorneys
wrote. “To Jack, the Ukraine war was his generation’s World War II or
Iraq, and he needed someone to share the experience with.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors, though, had countered that Teixeira does not suffer from
an intellectual disability that prevents him from knowing right from
wrong. They argued that Teixeira’s post-arrest diagnosis as having
“mild, high-functioning” autism “is of questionable relevance in these
proceedings.” </p>
<p>Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air
National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport
systems specialist, which is essentially an information technology
specialist responsible for military communications networks. He remains
in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official
said. </p>
<p>Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed
and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP
SECRET markings. Prosecutors also said he tried to cover his tracks
before his arrest, and authorities found a smashed tablet, laptop and an
Xbox gaming console in a dumpster at his house. </p>
<p>The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of
Russia’s war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements in
Ukraine, and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian
troops. Teixeira also admitted posting information about a U.S.
adversary’s plans to harm U.S. forces serving overseas.</p>

id="economists-wonder-whether-trump-will-follow-through-on-campaign-vows">Economists
wonder whether Trump will follow through on campaign vows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has left little question about the
sort of economic policies he will pursue when he is sworn in for a
second term as president in January.</p>
<p>The once-and-future president has promised to extend existing tax
cuts and implement new ones; to pursue a deregulation agenda,
particularly when it comes to energy production; to reinstate a strong
protectionist trade policy, including substantial tariffs on imports;
and to undertake a “mass deportation” program that would remove a large
number of the millions of undocumented immigrants currently residing in
the United States.</p>
<p>While there may be little doubt about the kind of policies Trump will
implement, the degree to which he will pursue them is an open
question.</p>
<p>“The problem that all economists are dealing with is they don’t know
how much of what Trump said on the campaign trail to take seriously,”
Steven B. Kamin, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American
Enterprise Institute, told VOA. “They don’t know if he’s going to do a
lot of these things, or if he is, how far he’ll take it.”</p>
<p>When it comes to tariffs, Trump has promised across-the-board 10%-20%
levies on all imports, and charges of up to 60% on goods coming from
China, which experts warn would be economically ruinous.</p>
<p>His rhetoric about fossil fuel extraction suggests he will drive up
oil and gas production, even though the U.S. is currently producing more
energy than it ever has.</p>
<p>On immigration, he and his advisers have vacillated between
suggesting that all undocumented people will be forcibly removed and
describing a much more targeted operation.</p>
<p>Tax policy</p>
<p>One thing that appears certain is that Trump will work with Congress
— which seems likely to be fully controlled by the Republican Party — to
extend the tax cuts that became law as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act, which he signed into law in 2017.</p>
<p>Those tax cuts reduced the income taxes paid by many American workers
and reduced taxable income by increasing the standard deduction. They
also sharply cut the top business income tax bracket from 39% to 21%.
Those provisions are all scheduled to expire over the next several
years, some as soon as 2025, and Trump has proposed making them
permanent.</p>
<p>Trump has also floated the idea of other tax cuts, including further
reducing the business income tax to a maximum of 15%, and making income
from overtime wages, tips and Social Security payments nontaxable, all
of which would reduce government revenues.</p>
<p>Kamin said the stimulative impact of Trump’s proposed additional tax
changes would likely not be great, but the impact on the country’s debt
might be, because they will virtually guarantee additional government
borrowing to finance deficit spending.</p>
<p>“The real concern for folks that are concerned about the fiscal
balance — and I’m one of them — is that by cementing in place large
fiscal deficits as far as the eye can see, even in environments of
strong economic activity when we should be running surpluses, that leads
to increases in the debt,” he said.</p>
<p>“That, eventually, should lead to crowding out of private investment,
rising interest rates, and more worries about the government’s
sustainability position,” Kamin added. “But when the debt will reach a
level that will be worrisome in that respect, nobody knows.”</p>
<p>Cost-cutting</p>
<p>In theory, some of the deficit spending made necessary by large tax
cuts could be offset by a reduction in government spending, something
Trump has also floated on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>In particular, the president-elect has proposed creating a Department
of Government Efficiency, to be headed by Elon Musk, the billionaire
founder of the electric car company Tesla and the rocket builder SpaceX,
and the owner of X, the social network formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>For his part, Musk has mused that it should be possible to slash
federal spending by as much as $2 trillion per year, or about 30%.</p>
<p>Reductions of that magnitude would require deep cuts to a vast array
of programs, including elements of the social safety net such as Social
Security and federal health programs like Medicaid. However, it is
unclear how Trump would persuade even a Republican Congress to enact
such a wide-ranging reduction in government services.</p>
<p>Immigration policy</p>
<p>If Trump follows through on a policy of mass deportation of
undocumented immigrants, it is virtually certain to have a negative
impact on economic sectors where they are present as laborers in
significant concentrations, especially agriculture and construction,
said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at
the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p>
<p>“If you take lots of people out of the labor force, you reduce the
amount of output, because there’s less labor available, and you raise
prices,” Noland told VOA.</p>
<p>“These people are not distributed evenly across the United States
economy,” he said. “They’re concentrated in agriculture and
construction, so you would disrupt those sectors the most, especially if
you combine it with tariffs.”</p>
<p>Trade policy</p>
<p>Trump’s tariff proposals, especially if he follows through with his
maximalist proposals from the campaign trail, could be significantly
damaging. While theoretically meant to stimulate American manufacturing,
Noland warned that they could have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>“Some modeling that I worked on suggest that those tariff policies,
instead of reviving the industrial sector, will actually reduce
industrial activity in the United States,” he warned.</p>
<p>Blanket tariffs on imports, and especially high levies on Chinese
goods, would create severe challenges for U.S. manufacturers.</p>
<p>“The reason is that you would increase the price of industrial
inputs, and so, the United States would become a high-cost place to
produce,” he said. “Investment would fall — and investment is intensive
in industrial materials — so, ironically, it has the opposite effect of
what its proponents say.”</p>

id="after-trumps-reelection-calls-grow-to-renew-us-focus-on-uyghur-rights">After
Trump’s reelection, calls grow to renew US focus on Uyghur rights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory,
leaders in the Uyghur American community are advocating for renewed U.S.
attention on human rights abuses in Xinjiang in northwest China, where
Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have reportedly faced severe
repression.</p>
<p>Advocates urge Trump to continue his administration’s previous
measures against China, citing the impact of his first-term policies on
Uyghur rights.</p>
<p>During Trump’s first term, his administration formally labeled
China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, leading to sanctions on Chinese
officials and entities connected with alleged abuses, including mass
detentions, forced labor and sterilizations. China has consistently
denied accusations of abuses against ethnic minorities, asserting its
policies aim to combat extremism and terrorism.</p>
<p>Nury Turkel, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former
chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom,
pointed to the bipartisan support for Uyghur rights, underscoring that
these concerns resonate across both U.S. legislative and executive
branches.</p>
<p>“[Uyghur rights] concerns extend beyond typical human rights issues.
They have profound national security implications tied to America’s
long-term economic and strategic security,” Turkel told VOA.</p>
<p>Turkel expressed cautious optimism that Trump’s new administration
will build on its previous actions, referencing the Uyghur Human Rights
Policy Act and the genocide designation.</p>
<p>“I am optimistic that the incoming administration will take concrete
steps to address these urgent concerns affecting Uyghurs, as it had
previously,” he said.</p>
<p>VOA contacted the Trump campaign for a comment regarding the new
administration’s plans for Uyghur rights in China but did not receive a
response at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Renewed calls for action</p>
<p>Uyghur American leaders plan to press Trump’s administration to
bolster sanctions on Chinese officials and entities involved in abuses
against Uyghurs, with the hope of strengthening the U.S. response.</p>
<p>“I anticipate that the Trump administration will impose additional
sanctions on Chinese officials and entities responsible for atrocity
crimes against the Uyghurs, potentially strengthening U.S. efforts to
confront these abuses,” Turkel added.</p>
<p>Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for
Uyghurs, emphasized the need for strict enforcement of the Uyghur Forced
Labor Prevention Act of 2021.</p>
<p>“Uyghurs are enduring a genocide, and Americans should know that
addressing the genocide of Uyghurs is not just a foreign policy matter;
it’s about preventing the U.S. from becoming complicit through the
consumption of Chinese products tainted by forced labor,” Abbas told
VOA. “[I]t’s about stopping China from using Americans’ hard-earned
money to fuel their imperial ambitions and undermine the United States,
and rejecting foreign intimidation on U.S. soil.”</p>
<p>Salih Hudayar, prime minister of the Washington-based East Turkistan
Government in Exile, echoed these sentiments, urging the Trump
administration to formally recognize the region — referred to as
Xinjiang by China but called East Turkistan by many Uyghurs —as an
occupied nation.</p>
<p>“An independent East Turkistan would directly challenge China’s
ambitions for dominance across Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific,
safeguarding American and broader global interests,” Hudayar told VOA.
He suggested appointing a special coordinator for Uyghur issues to
demonstrate U.S. support for Uyghur rights and those of other minorities
in the region.</p>
<p>Current policy challenges</p>
<p>Despite calls for stronger actions, Uyghur American advocates remain
concerned that economic and strategic interests with China may take
precedence. Turkel highlighted that various advocacy groups have
influenced the U.S. response to Uyghur issues in recent years.</p>
<p>“Climate activists have lobbied for closer cooperation with China on
environmental initiatives; pro-engagement China watchers have advocated
a softer, more conciliatory approach to ‘lower the temperature’ in
U.S.-China relations; and business interests have warned of the economic
risks of escalating tensions, pushing for policies that protect
U.S.-China trade relations,” he said. “These pressures have contributed
to a more nuanced stance and a quieter approach to human rights and
Uyghur-related policies.”</p>
<p>Turkel added, “While steps like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention
Act were commendable [during the Biden administration], the focus on
Uyghur rights has often been eclipsed by broader geopolitical
priorities,” pointing to how shifting U.S. economic priorities have
impacted the response.</p>
<p>Addressing transnational repression</p>
<p>In addition to actions on Uyghur rights, Uyghur American leaders are
urging the Trump administration to address transnational repression by
China, specifically targeting covert operations that intimidate Uyghur
Americans on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“The administration should take immediate steps to multiply the
efforts to counter transnational repression by Chinese authorities,
particularly targeting the presence of covert Chinese police stations
and agents who monitor and intimidate Uyghur Americans and China
dissidents in the U.S.,” Abbas said.</p>
<p>Abbas noted Trump’s efforts in securing hostage releases in his first
term, urging him to prioritize Uyghur detainees held in China.</p>
<p>“China continues to detain Uyghur [American] family members and
community leaders as a tactic to silence Uyghurs abroad … with many
forced to self-censor to protect their families,” she said, advocating
for strong U.S. efforts to secure their release and end repression
tactics targeting Uyghurs in the diaspora.</p>

The most important legal challenge for the renewables industry in

On Friday afternoon, about 70 towns and a handful of Michigan counties

The
<a href="https://mi-psc.my.site.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/068cs00000LJypEAAT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>appeal</u></a>
challenges multiple aspects of the law’s implementation, saying it went
beyond statute, as well as the rulemaking procedure itself, claiming it
failed to follow proper processes. The lawsuit aims to effectively undo
the law going into effect, or at least enjoin what opponents say are the
most onerous restrictions on municipalities and county governments.
</p>
<p>
Some of the places involved in the litigation have solar, wind, or
battery storage proposed in their backyards. But while it’s certainly
the case that some opponents may just want to stop projects from being
built, one of the attorneys behind the litigation – Michael Homier at
Michigan law firm Foster Swift – told me the case represents how these
laws inflame broader tensions between communities and their governments.
</p>
<p>
“[Renewables have] to be sited appropriately, because each community has
unique priorities and circumstances that relate to them,” Homier said.
“I think what it says is that local voices matter and when you try and
implement policy on a one-size fits all approach with all of these local
communities, they don’t like it.”
</p>
<p>
Local control laws like Michigan’s exist because, well, climate change
is an imperative that calls for rapid action. Delays stemming from
dissent at the municipal or county level can totally gum up the works,
as we’ve shown you time and time again. Michigan’s no
<a href="https://thecitizenonline.com/groveland-twp-pc-oks-battery-storage-ordinance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stranger
to this problem</u></a>. Opponents of the Michigan law sought to repeal
it via ballot initiative before the lawsuit was filed, but that effort
failed, and some ballot petition backers have since
<a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2024-10-18/group-against-renewable-energy-law-violated-campaign-finance-laws-says-mich-secretary-of-state" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gotten
a campaign finance complaint</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But it’s important to note these laws feel like shots to the heart of
small-d <em><em>democracy, </em></em>and the notion of
locally-controlled land use planning, too. As these policies become a
go-to for anxious Democratic politicians trying to get shovels into the
ground to bring down carbon emissions, one should hardly expect towns
and counties to take it lying down.
</p>
<p>
Take Maryland, where legislators have sought to pass bills similar to
Michigand’s. Despite the state’s ambitious climate goals, the Maryland
Association of Counties has vociferously opposed bills to
<a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2024/03/01/counties-object-to-total-abandonment-of-marylands-environmental-justice-principles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ban
counties and towns</u></a> from setting ordinances that restrict
renewable development and let community-scale solar advance
<a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2024/03/08/counties-oppose-narrowed-state-only-approval-for-energy-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>without
strenuous local review</u></a>. Or take New Jersey, where
<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-offshore-wind-project-new-law-bypass-local-approval/amp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transmission
cables</u></a> for offshore wind
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/atlantic-shores-transmission-opposition" target="_self"><u>may
produce</u></a> similar litigation to what’s in Michigan, testing the
constitutionality of the state’s local control law.
</p>
<p>
In Michigan, it’ll take upwards of a year or two for the case to wind
its way through court proceedings. Until then, we’ll pour one out for
any developer or climate wonk who thought that the state’s stab at
“permitting reform” was going to help.

<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Although Donald Trump has won the presidential election, nearly 11
weeks will pass before he can assume office, giving him 76 days to
prepare a new government.</p>

<h2
id="how-could-us-china-rivalry-in-africa-play-out-under-trump-2.0">How
could US-China rivalry in Africa play out under Trump 2.0?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg  — President-elect Donald Trump talked tough on China
during his campaign, vowing to impose higher and sweeping tariffs on
imports from the Asian giant. Beijing will now also be closely watching
the incoming administration’s movements further afield, in Africa, where
U.S.-China rivalry is high.</p>
<p>Experts disagree on what a second Trump term will mean for Beijing’s
ambitions on the continent, with some saying it could be a boon for
China – Africa’s biggest trade partner – if the U.S. pursues an
isolationist, “America First” agenda that mostly ignores the region.</p>
<p>But Tibor Nagy, who served as Trump’s Assistant Secretary of State
for African Affairs from 2018 to 2021 has a different perspective. He
said Trump grasped how powerful a player China had become on the
continent.</p>
<p>“It was the Trump administration that was the first to kind of
recognize the existential threat that China poses,” Nagy told VOA.</p>
<p>“We were on the front lines of that in Africa, and we saw what the
Chinese were doing,” said Nagy, who also served as the U.S. ambassador
to Guinea and Ethiopia during the administrations of presidents Bill
Clinton and George W. Bush.</p>
<p>Nagy told VOA he does not think the incoming Republican
administration will neglect Africa because it sees China as a threat to
U.S interests there. He also said the continent is a major source of
critical minerals attractive to both superpowers.</p>
<p>Nagy credits the first Trump administration with introducing policies
on the continent intended to counter China’s influence.</p>
<p>“We had … the right focus because we made it about the youth. You
know, our premise was that Africa is going to be undergoing a youth
tsunami with the population doubling by 2050. And that more than
anything, what the youth really wanted was jobs,” he said.</p>
<p>To this end, Nagy says, the first Trump administration set up Prosper
Africa in 2018, an initiative designed to assist American companies
doing business in Africa, and he expects the incoming administration
will remain engaged there.</p>
<p>“Africa remains very much the front lines,” he said. “The United
States is extremely concerned about our strategic minerals, and when a
hostile power has a lock on strategic minerals, that’s really not very
good when you need the strategic minerals for your top-end technology
and for weapon systems.”</p>
<p>But Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor for the China-Global South
Project, is skeptical and said a second term for Trump could be an
opportunity for Beijing.</p>
<p>“Looking at his first term, Trump didn’t show much interest in
Africa, which is likely to be the case still now,” he told VOA. “Only a
few countries will matter — countries whose resources or position matter
to the U.S. national security interests.”</p>
<p>“China will have room to maneuver and increase its influence in so
many ways,” he added.</p>
<p>Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, echoed
this.</p>
<p>“I doubt that Africa will be a featured priority for Trump,” she told
VOA in an emailed response, adding that the United States’ absence on
the continent “will boost the prominence of the Chinese position by its
presence.”</p>
<p>Lobito corridor future</p>
<p>Views on how successfully President Joe Biden’s administration has
engaged with Africa are also mixed. Many analysts said regardless of
whether the Democrats or the Republicans are in office, the continent is
usually an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy, which does not differ
much from one administration to the next.</p>
<p>The current administration said it was “all in on Africa,” when Biden
hosted dozens of heads of state at his first African Leaders Summit in
2022, an event seen as an attempt at reasserting U.S. influence in the
face of a rising China.</p>
<p>Yet, “African leaders or the African Union were not consulted about
the agenda of the 2022 US-Africa Leaders Summit. This was also the case
with the US’s Africa strategy,” wrote Christopher Isike, the director of
African Centre for the Study of the United States at the University of
Pretoria, in an article co-signed by Samuel Oyewole, political science
postdoctoral research fellow at the university</p>
<p>While Trump never traveled to Africa as president, top Biden
administration officials did visit the continent, including the vice
president. Biden is also expected to travel to Angola before the end of
his term in December.</p>
<p>Under Biden, the U.S. agreed to develop the Lobito Corridor and
Zambia-Lobito rail line, a project described by the State Department as
“the most significant transport infrastructure that the United States
has helped develop on the African continent in a generation.”</p>
<p>The rail line is seen as part of a transcontinental vision connecting
the Atlantic and Indian oceans.</p>
<p>The undertaking is to be financed through a joint agreement calling
for the U.S., African Development Bank, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC)
and the European Union to support Angola, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and Zambia.</p>
<p>Observers see it as an attempt to compete with Chinese President Xi
Jinping’s global infrastructure project the Belt and Road Initiative,
which has built railways, ports and roads across Africa.</p>
<p>There is concern among some analysts that Trump could pull back from
this.</p>
<p>“Existing bilateral and multilateral business partnerships … such as
the Lobito Corridor … might wane significantly during the next Trump
administration,” said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian analyst with the
Institute for Security Studies, in an email to VOA.</p>
<p>“When that happens China will gain significant mileage in areas where
the US Government’s exit creates a vacuum on the continent,” he
added.</p>
<p>But Nagy disagreed, saying the Lobito Corridor is the “kind of
project which would have come right out of the Trump
administration.”</p>
<p>Therefore, there’s likely to be continuity, he added, noting: “The
deal is done. Again, I can’t speak for President Trump, or the people
who are going to be coming in … but it’s logical.”</p>
<p>‘Other Friends’</p>
<p>When asked how African leaders will navigate the next Trump
administration, Sun said they could play the U.S. and China against each
other.</p>
<p>“Africa could highlight its role in the US-China great power
competition in order to strengthen its position in the US grand
strategy,” she said in an email to VOA.</p>
<p>But she is doubtful African leaders will take that route because it
“will carry the effect of being forced to choose, which I doubt that
Africa will want to do.”</p>
<p>However, at least one African politician has already alluded to this
option.</p>
<p>Kenya’s Raila Odinga, who is in the running to take over as chair of
the African Union Commission next year, was blunt in his assessment of
how African governments would handle a more isolationist U.S. under
Trump.</p>
<p>“If he does not want to work with Africa,” Odinga told Agence
France-Presse last week, “Africa has got other friends.”</p>

<h2 id="trumps-other-big-threat-to-renewables">Trump’s Other Big Threat
to Renewables</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ3MDEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTIxNzAxMH0.Ev8y-McfZHoxV4sFbxwuvh-y1gSk0dYn9_EEA4NfUsw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts were supposed to be a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_blank">bonanza</a>
for the clean energy business. Renewables, with their high upfront costs
compared to their costs of operating (the “fuel” — i.e. the wind and the
sun — is free), are especially sensitive to the cost of borrowing money.
When rates go up, it becomes more difficult for projects to hit the
profitability targets necessary to lure investors without jacking up
prices for customers beyond the realm of the possible. When rates comes
down — which the Fed has been working on doing since September —
suddenly those investments start to look a lot more appealing.
</p>
<p>
But there’s more to financing costs than the Fed. There’s also the
president.
</p>
<p>
While much of the focus on Donald Trump’s electoral victory has been
trying to discern what a Republican trifecta could do to the Inflation
Reduction Act, Trump’s effect on the bond market may be just as
important. We may still living in
<a href="https://policyexchange.org.uk/blogs/beware-the-bond-markets/" target="_blank">James
Carville’s world</a>, where the bond market can “intimidate everybody.”
And it’s rearing its head against the president-reelect.
</p>
<p>
Since Trump came to be seen as the likely winner in the months before
election day, yields on U.S. government debt — that is, the returns
bondholders and issuers have to offer to entice investors — began to
shoot up. Interpreting moves in the bond market is always tricky, but
many market commentators interpreted the recent run-up as at least in
part a reaction to Trump, whether they thought he was going to juice
economic growth or stoke inflation, or some combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
“If Trump is proposing a broadly inflationary high-tariff, low-tax
agenda, anyone expecting inflation is looking for a higher return,”
explained Advait Arun, a climate and infrastructure finance analyst at
the Center for Public Enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Each of these policies — high tariffs and low taxes — could have an
inflationary effect. Tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices
(especially the kind of
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broad-based
tariffs</a> Trump has proposed) while tax cuts act as stimulus by
keeping more cash in the economy. Combined with higher defense spending
and a reduced labor force if Trump follows through on his plan for
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/12/mexico-trump-mass-deportation/" target="_blank">mass
deportations</a>, the whole policy agenda could wind up reversing some
of the progress the economy has made recovering from the high inflation
of the immediate post-COVID period, or at least make it so the Federal
Reserve sees no further need to cut interest rates.
</p>
<p>
“Tariffs, especially if universally placed on all imports, is broadly
viewed as an inflationary policy, which may pose a risk to the outlook
for lower interest rates,” Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Perocco wrote
in a note to clients. “All else equal, higher rates are seen as a
headwind for the renewable energy sector due to higher financing costs.”
</p>
<p>
Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, a widely used benchmark throughout
the global economy, were sitting at around 3.6% in mid-September when
the Fed began cutting rates, but had risen to 4.36% the week before the
election. Yields shot up again last week
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-07/us-yield-spike-sends-message-to-trump-bond-vigilantes-are-awake" target="_blank">after
Trump’s win</a>, which confirmed the market’s suspicion that his
inflationary plans will be realized. Today they’re around 4.43% and
rising.
</p>
<p>
“Interest rates are moving higher in much the same way they did when he
won in 2016,” aid Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America
told me. “There’s a Trump trade people do — the dollar gets stronger,
interest rates are higher.” These policies may be “more stimulative to
the economy on some level,” and in turn, “maybe this means the Fed is
more cautious about lowering interest rates.”
</p>
<p>
The market certainly seems to think Trump will run the economy hot.
Expectations for where the federal funds rate could end up by the end of
2025 have risen from
<a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/falling-interest-rates-alone-may-not-imminently-boost-investments-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><u>3%
in September to about 3.8%</u></a>, Gautam Jain, a senior research
scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Several
analysts
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/wall-street-fed-watchers-dial-back-2025-rate-cut-expectations" target="_blank"><u>have
scaled back their forecasts</u></a> for the number of future Federal
Reserve rate cuts next after the Fed lowered rates by another quarter
percentage point last week. Yields on two-year Treasury notes, which are
considered to be highly sensitive to expectations of Federal Reserve
action, have risen from 3.55% in mid-September to 4.34% today, the
highest level since July.
</p>
<p>
And sustained high rates mean sustained high costs for renewable energy
companies. Jain had previously estimated that a 2 percentage point drop
in the cost of debt would lower offshore wind costs by as much as $10
per megawatt-hour and utility-scale solar by as much as <strong>
</strong>$12 per megawatt-hour, which would help make them more
competitive even in the absence of federal subsidies. If the cost of
capital stays high, that potential boost goes away.
</p>
<p>
“For renewables, they are more capital intensive, so they are more
impacted” by rising rates, Jain told me. “The headwind will hurt them
more.”
</p>
<p>
Bipartisan budget watchdogs have been skeptical of Trump’s policies,
typically projecting
<a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans" target="_blank">larger
deficit increases</a> than would have arisen from the policy agenda of
Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. That said, not everyone is worried.
</p>
<p style>
The hedge-fund investor Scott Bessent,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/key-advisers-to-trump-back-bessent-for-treasury-secretary" target="_blank">widely
tipped</a> to be Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary,
<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/possible-trump-pick-for-treasury-lays-out-3-point-economic-plan-that-calls-for-deregulation-lower-deficit-b9a1e4c7" target="_blank">has
been promoting a “3-3-3” plan</a> — deficits reduced to 3% of gross
domestic product from around 7% currently by the end of Trump’s term;
annual growth kicked up to 3% from around 2.8% today; and oil production
increased by 3 million barrels, all of which could allow the Federal
Reserve to bring down rates.
</p>
<p style>
Trump “understands financial markets and the bond markets. He would not
want deficits to get out of control,” Stephen Miran, a fellow at the
Manhattan Institute and former Trump Treasury official told me. “There’s
a lot of focus to rein that in.” <br/>

<h2
id="jury-awards-abu-ghraib-detainees-42-million-holds-contractor-responsible">Jury
awards Abu Ghraib detainees $42 million, holds contractor
responsible</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A U.S. jury on Tuesday awarded $42 million to
three former detainees of Iraq’s notorious Abu Ghraib prison, holding a
Virginia-based military contractor responsible for contributing to their
torture and mistreatment two decades ago. </p>
<p>The decision from the eight-person jury came after a different jury
earlier this year couldn’t agree on whether Reston, Virginia-based CACI
should be held liable for the work of its civilian interrogators who
worked alongside the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004. </p>
<p>The jury awarded plaintiffs Suhail Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and
Asa’ad Al-Zubae $3 million each in compensatory damages and $11 million
each in punitive damages. </p>
<p>The three testified that they were subjected to beatings, sexual
abuse, forced nudity and other cruel treatment at the prison. </p>
<p>They did not allege that CACI’s interrogators explicitly inflicted
the abuse themselves, but argued CACI was complicit because its
interrogators conspired with military police to “soften up” detainees
for questioning with harsh treatment. </p>
<p>CACI’s lawyer, John O’Connor, did not comment after Tuesday’s verdict
on whether the company would appeal. </p>
<p>Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which
filed the lawsuit on the plaintiffs’ behalf, called the verdict “an
important measure of Justice and accountability” and praised the three
plaintiffs for their resilience, “especially in the face of all the
obstacles CACI threw their way.” </p>
<p>The $42 million fully matches the amount sought by the plaintiffs,
Azmy said. </p>
<p>“Today is a big day for me and for justice,” said Al-Ejaili, a
journalist, in a written statement. “I’ve waited a long time for this
day. This victory isn’t only for the three plaintiffs in this case
against a corporation. This victory is a shining light for everyone who
has been oppressed and a strong warning to any company or contractor
practicing different forms of torture and abuse.” </p>
<p>Al-Ejaili traveled to the U.S. for both trials to testify in person.
The other two plaintiffs testified by video from Iraq. </p>
<p>The trial and subsequent retrial were the first time a U.S. jury
heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since
photos of detainee mistreatment — accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers
inflicting the abuse — shocked the world during the U.S. occupation of
Iraq. </p>
<p>None of the three plaintiffs were in any of the notorious photos
shown in news reports around the world, but they described treatment
very similar to what was depicted. </p>
<p>Al Shimari described sexual assaults and beatings during his two
months at the prison. He also said he was electrically shocked and
dragged around the prison by a rope tied around his neck. Al-Ejaili said
he was subjected to stress positions that caused him to vomit black
liquid. He was also deprived of sleep, forced to wear women’s underwear
and threatened with dogs. </p>
<p>CACI had argued it wasn’t complicit in the detainees’ abuse. It said
its employees had minimal interaction with the three plaintiffs in the
case, and CACI questioned parts of the plaintiffs’ stories, saying that
military records contradict some of their claims and suggesting they
shaded their stories to support a case against the contractor.
Fundamentally, though, CACI argued that any liability for their
mistreatment belonged to the government. </p>
<p>As in the first trial, the jury struggled to decide whether CACI or
the Army should be held responsible for any misconduct by CACI
interrogators. The jury asked questions in its deliberations about
whether the contractor or the Army bore liability. </p>
<p>CACI, as one of its defenses, argued it shouldn’t be liable for any
misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and direction
of the Army, under a legal principle known as the “borrowed servants”
doctrine. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that CACI was responsible for its
own employees’ misdeeds. They said provisions in CACI’s contract with
the Army, as well as the Army Field Manual, make clear that CACI is
responsible for overseeing its own workers. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 but was delayed by 15 years of
legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case
dismissed. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the three plaintiffs argued that CACI was liable for
their mistreatment even if they couldn’t prove that CACI’s interrogators
were the ones who directly inflicted the abuse. </p>
<p>The evidence included reports from two retired Army generals, who
documented the abuse and concluded that multiple CACI interrogators were
complicit in the abuse. </p>
<p>Those reports concluded that one of the interrogators, Steven
Stefanowicz, lied to investigators about his conduct and that he likely
instructed soldiers to mistreat detainees and used dogs to intimidate
detainees during interrogations. </p>
<p>Stefanowicz testified for CACI at trial through a recorded video
deposition and denied mistreating detainees.</p>

<h2 id="trump-picks-key-political-loyalists-for-top-jobs">Trump picks
key political loyalists for top jobs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is moving quickly to fill his
nascent administration with Republican officials who have been the most
politically loyal to him in the four years he was out of office.</p>
<p>Trump, according to various U.S. news accounts, intends to nominate
Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, the country’s top
diplomat, but that announcement has yet to be made.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, he announced South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as
his choice for Homeland Security chief. Other Cabinet-level picks
announced Tuesday night include Pete Hegseth as the head of the
Department of Defense, and John Ratcliffe as the director of the
CIA.</p>
<p>Both Rubio and Noem were on Trump’s short list of possible vice
presidential running mates several months ago. While Trump later picked
first-term Ohio Senator JD Vance, now the vice president-elect, to join
him on the Republican national ticket, both Rubio and Noem remained
Trump stalwarts as he easily won the election last week over Democratic
Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe was the nation’s sixth Director of National Intelligence,
serving for the last eight months of the Trump administration after a
rocky confirmation process. Hegseth is a veteran and a Fox News
host.</p>
<p>Trump also announced that billionaire businessman Elon Musk and
entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek
Ramaswamy will lead what he called the Department of Government
Efficiency. The announcement said they would provide advice and guidance
to “drive large-scale structural reform” of the federal government.</p>
<p>Trump also announced on Tuesday that he has chosen William McGinley
as White House counsel.</p>
<p>Trump also has settled on Michael Waltz, a Florida congressman, as
his national security adviser. Waltz earlier this year supported a
long-shot Republican legislative effort to rename Washington’s
international airport for Trump.</p>
<p>Trump on Monday also named Thomas Homan, his former acting
immigration chief, to be his “border czar” to head efforts to deport
undocumented migrants living in the U.S., possibly millions, back to
their home countries. News accounts reported that Stephen Miller,
another vocal anti-migrant adviser who served in Trump’s first term,
would be named as Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy.</p>
<p>The president-elect picked another ardent supporter, Elise Stefanik,
a New York congresswoman, as the new U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations. He nominated former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to be
ambassador to Israel.</p>
<p>Just ahead of the election, Trump, who only rarely publicly admits
making any mistakes, told podcaster Joe Rogan that his biggest error
during his term from 2017 to 2021 was hiring “bad people, or disloyal
people.”</p>
<p>“I picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked,” he said.</p>
<p>Some of the top officials Trump chose then, including former chief of
staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton, became sharp
public Trump critics after he ousted them. Kelly said during this year’s
campaign that Trump met the definition of a fascist ruler. Trump
attacked both former officials, calling Kelly “a bully but a weak
person” and disparaging Bolton as “an idiot.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the election, Bolton said, “What Trump will look for in
senior nominees in a second term is fealty. He wants ‘yes men’ and ‘yes
women.’”</p>
<p>Rubio sparred sharply with Trump during their 2016 run for the
Republican presidential nomination, which Trump captured enroute to his
first term as president. Rubio mocked Trump as having small hands and
sporting an orange spray tan, while Trump derided Rubio as “little
Marco.”</p>
<p>But Rubio, like numerous other one-time Trump critics, was a staunch
Trump supporter in this year’s campaign. In recent years, Rubio has
proved to be an outspoken foreign policy hawk, taking hard lines on U.S.
relations with China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
<p>He has at times been at odds with Republicans who were skeptical
about U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, such as helping to fund
Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s 2022 invasion. But more recently, he
voted against sending more U.S. military aid to Ukraine, while Trump has
also voiced skepticism about the extent of U.S. assistance to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Rubio told NBC News in September, “I think the Ukrainians have been,
such incredibly brave and strong in standing up to Russia. But at the
end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war, and it
needs to be brought to a conclusion, or that country is going to be set
back 100 years.”</p>
<p>“I’m not on Russia’s side — but unfortunately, the reality of it is
that the way the war in Ukraine is going to end is with a negotiated
settlement,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>Noem rose to national prominence and won conservative plaudits after
refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2021.</p>
<p>Trump was reportedly considering her as his vice-presidential running
mate. But she faced widespread criticism and fell in the stakes to be
Trump’s No. 2 in April when she wrote in a memoir that she shot to death
an “untrainable” dog that she “hated” on her family farm.</p>
<p>Waltz is a former Army Green Beret who shares Trump’s views on
illegal immigration and skepticism of America’s continued support for
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Waltz, who also has served in the National Guard as a colonel, has
criticized Chinese activity in the Asia-Pacific and said the United
States needs to be ready for a potential conflict in the region.</p>
<p>Just as notable as Trump’s initial selections are two former
officials he has rejected for top jobs in his new administration: Nikki
Haley, his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and former
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Haley ran against Trump for the 2024
Republican presidential nomination and Pompeo considered opposing Trump
before backing off.</p>
<p>Trump is heading to Washington on Wednesday to meet with President
Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, about the transfer
of power when Trump is inaugurated on January 20. Trump is also planning
to meet with Republicans in the House of Representatives.</p>

judge blocks Louisiana law that requires classrooms to display Ten
Commandments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — A new Louisiana law that requires the Ten
Commandments to be displayed in every public classroom by Jan. 1 has
been temporarily blocked after a federal judge granted a preliminary
injunction on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The judge said the law is “unconstitutional on its face” and
plaintiffs are likely to win their case with claims that the law
violates the First Amendment. </p>
<p>The ruling marks a win for opponents of the law, who argue that it is
a violation of the separation of church and state and that the
poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students,
especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say that the measure
is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the
foundation of U.S. law. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge issued the
order in an ongoing lawsuit filed by a group of parents of Louisiana
public school children. They say that the legislation violates First
Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and
guaranteeing religious liberty. </p>
<p>The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is
ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state’s
Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. </p>
<p>The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including
President-elect Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by
conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms — from Florida
legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to
counsel students to Oklahoma’s top education official ordering public
schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons. </p>
<p>In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be
displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including
Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over
the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect. </p>
<p>In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was
unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.” The high court found that the law had no
secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose. </p>
<p>Louisiana’s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 school and
state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be
displayed on a poster or framed document at least 28 by 36 centimeters
where the text is the central focus and “printed in a large, easily
readable font.” </p>
<p>Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph “context
statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of
American public education for almost three centuries.” </p>
<p>Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the
new law. Proponents say that schools are not required to spend public
money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using
donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual
posters.</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-push-to-move-georgia-case-against-ex-trump-chief-of-staff-meadows">Supreme
Court rejects push to move Georgia case against ex-Trump chief of staff
Meadows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to let former Trump
White House chief of staff Mark Meadows move the election interference
case against him in Georgia to federal court. </p>
<p>Meadows was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia and accused of
participating in an illegal scheme to keep then-president Donald Trump
in power after he lost the 2020 election. Trump was also charged, though
after he won reelection last week to a second term any trial appears
unlikely, at least while he holds office. Both men have denied
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>It’s unclear what effect the election results could have on others
charged in the case, which is largely on hold after an appeals court
agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani
Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she
had hired to lead the case. </p>
<p>Meadows had gone to the Supreme Court in an effort to move the
charges out of Georgia courts. He argues the case belongs in federal
court because it relates to his duties as a federal official, and he
pointed to the Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from
criminal prosecution to support his argument. </p>
<p>“A White House chief of staff facing criminal charges based on
actions relating to his work for the president of the United States
should not be a close call — especially now that this court has
recognized that federal immunity impacts what evidence can be
considered, not just what conduct can form the basis for liability,” his
attorneys wrote. </p>
<p>But prosecutors said that Meadows failed to show he was carrying out
official duties during the alleged scheme, including participating in a
phone call where Trump suggested Georgia Secretary of State Brad
Raffensperger could help “find” votes he needed to win the state. </p>
<p>They argued the case should stay with Georgia courts, and Meadows can
raise immunity defenses there. Prosecutors also pushed back against the
contention that the charges could have ripple effects on other federal
officials. </p>
<p>“His references to the overheated words of opinion editorials cannot
suffice to demonstrate that a new era of ubiquitous prosecution of
former federal officials is at hand,” government attorneys wrote. </p>
<p>A U.S. district judge and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both
ruled that the case against Meadows and some of his co-defendants should
remain in state court. A federal judge has also refused to move an
Arizona fake elector case against him there to federal court. </p>
<p>Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case
after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump
and Meadows, have pleaded not guilty.</p>

id="judge-delays-ruling-on-whether-to-scrap-trumps-conviction-in-hush-money-case">Judge
delays ruling on whether to scrap Trump’s conviction in hush money
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A judge is postponing a decision on whether to undo
President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because
of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>New York Judge Juan M. Merchan had been set to rule Tuesday. Instead,
he told Trump’s lawyers Tuesday he’d delay the ruling until Nov. 19.</p>
<p>According to emails filed in court, Trump lawyer Emil Bove asked for
the delay over the weekend, arguing that putting the case on hold — and
then ending it altogether — is “necessary to avoid unconstitutional
impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors agreed to the delay.</p>
<p>Trump won back the White House a week ago but the legal question
concerns the Republican’s status as a past president, not an impending
one.</p>
<p>A jury convicted Trump in May of falsifying business records related
to a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in 2016. The payout
was to buy her silence about claims that she had sex with Trump.</p>
<p>He says they didn’t, denies any wrongdoing and maintains the
prosecution was a political tactic meant to harm his latest
campaign.</p>
<p>Just over a month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that
ex-presidents can’t be prosecuted for actions they took in the course of
running the country, and prosecutors can’t cite those actions even to
bolster a case centered on purely personal conduct.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers cited the ruling to argue that the hush money jury
got some evidence it shouldn’t have, such as Trump’s presidential
financial disclosure form and testimony from some White House aides.</p>
<p>Prosecutors disagreed and said the evidence in question was only “a
sliver” of their case.</p>
<p>Trump’s criminal conviction was a first for any ex-president. It left
the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine
or probation to up to four years in prison.</p>
<p>The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal
attorney for the Daniels payment.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it
through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal
expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks
himself.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose
of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from
hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and
that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family,
not to influence the electorate.</p>
<p>Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither
elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was
president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they
discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump has been fighting for months to overturn the verdict and could
now seek to leverage his status as president-elect. Although he was
tried as a private citizen, his forthcoming return to the White House
could propel a court to step in and avoid the unprecedented spectacle of
sentencing a former and future president.</p>
<p>While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also has been
trying to move the case to federal court. Before the election, a federal
judge repeatedly said no to the move, but Trump has appealed.</p>

Tom Wilson, an energy correspondent with the <em><em>Financial
Times</em></em>. The original ruling, issued by a lower court in a case
brought by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens, said Shell
had to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The
landmark decision marked the first time a court ordered a private
company to align its efforts with the goals of the Paris Agreement. But
Shell appealed, arguing that it was already working to reduce its
emissions (aiming for a 15-20% reduction by 2030 compared to 2016), that
it can’t be held responsible for how customers use its products, and
that such rules should be made by governments, not courts. “The Dutch
court case may serve as a bellwether, with potential ripple effects on
future decisions across the region,”

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-brussels-to-push-for-ukraine-aid">Blinken heads
to Brussels to push for Ukraine aid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading
to Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday as Washington looks for ways to “surge”
military aid to Ukraine in the final days of President Joe Biden’s term.
 </p>
<p>After Brussels, Blinken will proceed to Lima, Peru, for Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meetings, followed by stops in Manaus and Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, for a summit of the 20 largest economies, the G20. He
will join Biden in Peru and Brazil.</p>
<p>President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to hold
face-to-face talks on Saturday on the sidelines of the APEC summit, a
meeting anticipated to last about one-and-a-half hours, according to
sources familiar with the plans who spoke to VOA on the condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Blinken will engage in discussions with his NATO and
European Union counterparts to coordinate continued support for Ukraine,
while President Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump at the
White House. Officials said Biden will ask Trump not to “walk away” from
Ukraine.  </p>
<p>North Korea’s direct support for Russia’s war in Ukraine is expected
to be a focal point during Blinken’s discussions with European
counterparts and will likely feature on the agenda in talks between U.S.
officials and their counterparts at APEC.</p>
<p>Ukraine has reported that North Korean troops are actively engaged in
combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, prompting condemnation from
several European nations over the increasing military collaboration
between Russia and North Korea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine remained on high alert for air attacks on Monday,
with the country’s top military commander reporting that tens of
thousands of Russian troops were prepared to advance on Russia’s Kursk
region, where Ukraine seized territory in August this year.</p>
<p>Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
told VOA that Trump might attempt to “broker a cease-fire in Ukraine,” a
prominent foreign policy pledge he made during his campaign.</p>
<p>Kupchan, however, noted, “It will not be as easy as he promised…  It
will take a long time to bring [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy
and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to common ground,” as the
conflict has stretched on for more than two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>Trump’s political allies have indicated that the incoming
administration will prioritize achieving peace in Ukraine over enabling
the country to reclaim Crimea and other territories occupied by
Russia.</p>
<p>After the U.S. presidential election, the State Department said that
Blinken spoke with his European counterparts. They included the French
minister for Europe and foreign affairs, Jean-Noël Barrot, German
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and the United Kingdom’s foreign
secretary, David Lammy, among others. Officials say talks covered the
situation in Ukraine and the implications and threats posed by Russia’s
decision to introduce North Korean troops into the war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Blinken’s coming meetings in Brussels also follow a gathering of
European leaders Thursday in Budapest, where they addressed
transatlantic relations, support for Ukraine, and other pressing issues
in light of Trump’s victory in last week’s U.S. presidential
election.</p>

<h2 id="us-will-not-cut-military-aid-to-israel-over-gaza-aid">US will
not cut military aid to Israel over Gaza aid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States said Tuesday that Israel has made limited progress
on increasing the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip as
Washington requested, so the Biden administration will not limit arms
transfers to Israel.</p>
<p>State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that
“we at this time have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in
violation of U.S. law.”</p>
<p>The administration told its ally on October 13 that it had one month
to increase aid to Gaza, where the situation after 13 months of war
between Israel and Hamas militants has unleashed a catastrophic
humanitarian situation, or face a reduction in military aid. The
deadline was Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We are not giving Israel a pass,” Patel said, adding that “we want
to see the totality of the humanitarian situation improve, and we think
some of these steps will allow the conditions for that to continue to
progress.”</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israel’s top national
security adviser, Ron Dermer, in Washington on Monday to go over the
steps that Israel has taken.</p>
<p>At the United Nations, U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the
Security Council that Israel has taken some important steps, including
restoring aid deliveries to the north, but that it must ensure its
actions are “fully implemented and its improvements sustained over
time.”</p>
<p>“And we continue to reiterate, there must be no forcible displacement
nor policy of starvation in Gaza, which would have grave implications
under U.S. and international law,” she said.</p>
<p>A senior U.N. human rights official said at the same meeting that the
entry and distribution of aid into Gaza has fallen to “some of the
lowest levels in a year” and criticized Israel’s conduct of military
operations in the north.</p>
<p>“All states, consistent with their obligations under international
law, must therefore assess arms sales or transfers and provision of
military, logistical or financial support to a party to the conflict,
with a view to ending such support if this risks serious violations of
international law,” Ilze Brands Kehris, U.N. assistant secretary-general
for human rights, said.</p>
<p>Israel denies it is limiting aid to Gaza, blaming the U.N. and aid
agencies for slow distribution and Hamas for stealing it.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, eight international aid organizations said that of
19 measures of compliance with the U.S. demands, Israel failed to comply
with 15 and only partially complied with four.</p>
<p>“Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate
support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that
dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in
Northern Gaza,” the report said. “That situation is in an even more dire
state today than a month ago.”</p>
<p>Asked what grade the United Nations would give Israel, spokesperson
Stephane Dujarric would not offer one, but said, “I think from what
we’ve been telling you over the last few days and frankly much longer,
it’s pretty clear that we’re nowhere near what we need.”</p>
<p>While aid entering Gaza is insufficient overall, the U.N. Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says it is especially bad in
northern Gaza, where 85% of its attempts to coordinate aid convoys and
humanitarian visits in October were denied or impeded.</p>
<p>“As I brief you, Israeli authorities are blocking humanitarian
assistance from entering North Gaza, where fighting continues, and
around 75,000 people remain with dwindling water and food supplies,”
acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya told the Security Council
meeting.</p>
<p>“Conditions of life across Gaza are unfit for human survival,” she
said.</p>
<p>Famine alert</p>
<p>On Friday, U.N.-backed food security experts issued an urgent
warning, saying there is a strong likelihood that famine is occurring or
imminent in parts of northern Gaza and that immediate action is needed
to avert a catastrophe.</p>
<p>“By the time famine has been declared, people are already dying of
hunger, with irreversible consequences that can last generations,” Rein
Paulsen told the Security Council meeting. Paulsen is the director of
the Office of Emergencies and Resilience at the U.N.’s Food and
Agriculture Organization.</p>
<p>“The window of opportunity to deliver this assistance is now, today,
not tomorrow,” he said.</p>
<p>Israel’s U.N. ambassador told reporters ahead of the council meeting
that the report by the famine committee of the Integrated Food Security
Phase Classification, or IPC as the experts are known, is “harmful
propaganda” and “filled with baseless and slanderous claims” against
Israel.</p>
<p>“As I have said here in the past, there are agencies dedicated to
real humanitarian work, and then there are those like the IPC, which
prioritize smearing Israel over actually helping those in need,” Danny
Danon said.</p>
<p>Inside the council, he said IPC claims of imminent famine in northern
Gaza are “simply false,” and that Israel facilitated over 713 trucks
into the north in October. He said across Gaza, a dozen bakeries produce
pita bread, and overall, Israel is allowing aid in through multiple
crossing points, including the Kissufim crossing to central Gaza, which
was opened on Tuesday after having been shuttered 19 years ago.</p>
<p>“Are these the actions of a state wishing to cause a famine?” Danon
asked.</p>
<p>Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said Israel should allow
international journalists into Gaza to see for themselves whether there
is famine or not.</p>
<p>“We need international media, independent media, to go and to
document exactly what is happening,” Mansour told reporters. “It is
genocide in northern Gaza, and we need the international media to go and
tell the story.”</p>
<p>In 13 months of war, Israel has allowed only a few handpicked
reporters to accompany its troops into Gaza on brief tours to see the
Hamas tunnels. It has also shuttered the bureau of Qatar-based news
channel Al Jazeera in Israel. According to the Committee to Protect
Journalists, at least 137 journalists and media workers have been
killed, nearly all of them Palestinian.</p>
<p>As the situation worsens, the Security Council’s 10 elected members
are working on a draft resolution on the protection of civilians in the
conflict and the need for an immediate cease-fire, release of hostages
and scaling up of aid.</p>
<p>Biden reaffirms support for Israel</p>
<p>President Joe Biden reiterated his support of Israel during a Tuesday
Oval Office meeting with Israel’s president and echoed the wish to see
the return of the remaining hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza for
more than a year.</p>
<p>“My commitment to Israel is ironclad,” Biden told President Isaac
Herzog during their morning meeting in the White House. “And we share a
deep friendship.”</p>
<p>Herzog underscored his government’s main objective: “First and
foremost, we have to get the hostages back.”</p>
<p>As President-elect Donald Trump begins to put his government
together, his transition office announced Tuesday that former Arkansas
governor Mike Huckabee is his nominee for U.S. ambassador to Israel, and
real estate investor Steve Witkoff will be his special envoy to the
Middle East.</p>
<p>Air strikes in Gaza, Beirut</p>
<p>Israeli airstrikes killed at least 14 people in Gaza on Tuesday,
Palestinian authorities said, while in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose
above Beirut’s southern suburbs less than an hour after Israeli forces
told residents to evacuate.</p>
<p>A strike early Tuesday hit a house at a refugee camp in central Gaza,
killing three people, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the
casualties.</p>
<p>Israel’s new defense minister, Israel Katz, said on X that during a
meeting with military officials Tuesday, he reiterated that Israel will
continue hitting Hezbollah with full force, and that there will be no
cease-fire in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into
southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside
Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians,
more than half of them women and children, according to local health
authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands
of Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The war spread to Lebanon in mid-September, after months of rocket
fire from Hezbollah into Israel and drone and airstrikes by Israel’s
military in south Lebanon escalated. More than 3,200 Lebanese have been
killed, most of them in the past six weeks.</p>
<p>Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terrorist
organizations by the United States.</p>

and China must counter any US attempt at containment, Shoigu says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — The key task for Russia and China is to counter any attempt
by the United States to contain their countries, an ally of Russian
President Vladimir Putin told China’s foreign minister on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep
tariffs on China and other countries, raising fears of a trade war and
the United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as
its biggest nation-state threat.</p>
<p>China’s Xi Jinping and Putin in May pledged a “new era” of
partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States,
which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across
the world.</p>
<p>Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that the strong relations between Moscow and
Beijing were a stabilizing influence on the world.</p>
<p>“I see the most important task as countering the policy of ‘dual
containment’ of Russia and China pursued by the United States and its
satellites,” Shoigu was quoted as saying by Russian state news
agencies.</p>
<p>Xi and Putin believe the post-Cold War era of extraordinary U.S.
dominance is crumbling after the perceived humiliations of the 1991
Soviet collapse and centuries of European colonial dominance of
China.</p>

Mayor Eric Adams requests earlier trial date so he can focus on
reelection campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams is seeking to move up the
start of his trial on corruption and bribery charges so he can focus on
his campaign for reelection this spring.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the federal judge on Monday, an attorney for
Adams, Alex Spiro, requested the trial begin on April 1 rather than the
current planned date of April 23.</p>
<p>“An earlier trial date will ensure that Mayor Adams’s speedy trial
rights are upheld, that the Mayor will be able to fully participate in
his reelection campaign and that this City’s voters can be rid of the
distraction of this misguided indictment as they hear from and evaluate
the Democratic candidates for Mayor on their merits,” Spiro wrote.</p>
<p>Adams, a Democrat, was indicted in September on charges that he
accepted luxury travel perks and illegal campaign contributions from a
Turkish official seeking political favors. He has pleaded not guilty to
the charges and insisted he will remain in office as he fights the
case.</p>
<p>He is expected to face a contested Democratic primary in June, with
several opponents already announcing their interest in challenging
him.</p>
<p>Inquiries to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan were not
returned.</p>
<p>At a hearing earlier this month, prosecutors said they would be ready
for a trial whenever it is scheduled, but noted they were still making
their way through reams of seized records and had not yet accessed
Adams’ personal cellphone. According to his indictment. Adams changed
his password just before giving the phone to authorities, then claimed
he forgot it.</p>
<p>In his letter on Monday, Spiro said he would waive access to certain
discovery materials if it meant speeding up the date of the trial. Under
the current schedule, he predicted a verdict would come in late May,
giving the mayor only a short window of time to clear his name among
voters.</p>
<p>“Given the realities of the news and election cycle, this earlier
trial date is not only feasible, but essential here,” Spiro wrote.</p>

in Oakland oust Mayor Sheng Thao just 2 years into her term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OAKLAND, Calif. — Voters in Oakland, California, have ousted Mayor
Sheng Thao just two years after she narrowly won office to lead the
liberal San Francisco Bay Area city.</p>
<p>The Associated Press called the race Monday.</p>
<p>“Thank you for choosing me to serve as your Mayor. As the first Hmong
American woman to become the mayor of a major American City, it has been
the honor of my lifetime,” she said in a statement last week.</p>
<p>She committed to ensuring a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Thao must vacate the office as soon as election results are certified
Dec. 5 and the Oakland City Council declares a vacancy at its next
meeting, which would be Dec. 17, Nikki Fortunato Bas, City Council
president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>A special election for a new mayor will be held within 120 days, or
roughly four months.</p>
<p>Until then, Bas — as president of the City Council — would serve as
interim mayor unless she wins a seat on the Alameda County Board of
Supervisors. As of Monday, Bas was trailing in that race.</p>
<p>Thao was elected mayor in November 2022 and became the first Hmong
American to lead a major city. She faced criticism almost immediately
after taking office for firing popular Oakland Police Chief LeRonne
Armstrong. Frustrated voters, including the local NAACP, blamed Thao for
a long list of city woes related to public safety, homelessness and the
city’s budget.</p>
<p>In her statement, Thao said she was proud of her administration’s
accomplishments.</p>
<p>Thao was not the only official booted from office in Tuesday’s
election. Pamela Price, district attorney for Alameda County, which
includes Oakland, also was ousted by voters in a recall election.
Critics of both Thao and Price disagreed with the officials’ progressive
politics.</p>
<p>Thao went into Tuesday’s election weakened by an FBI raid in June of
her home — along with properties owned by a politically influential
family that controls the city’s recycling contract. Thao has maintained
her innocence and authorities have not said what they are
investigating.</p>
<p>Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system that allows voters to list
multiple choices in order of preference. Thao narrowly beat Loren Taylor
in 2022 despite getting fewer first-place votes than Taylor.</p>
<p>Oakland has about 400,000 residents and is, at times, more
politically liberal than San Francisco. It is Vice President Kamala
Harris’ hometown.</p>
<p>In recent years, Oakland has lost three professional sports
franchises, including Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent state highway patrol officers,
state prosecutors, and surveillance cameras to help Oakland battle
crime.</p>

<h2 id="trump-set-to-go-after-measures-mitigating-climate-change">Trump
set to go after measures mitigating climate change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The election of Donald Trump as president for a second
time and the Republican takeback of the U.S. Senate could undo many of
the national climate policies that are most reducing planet-warming
greenhouse gas emissions, according to climate solutions experts. </p>
<p>When they list measures that are making the most difference, it lines
up with policies Trump has said he’ll target.</p>
<p>These rollbacks will come as more lives are being lost in heat waves,
record amounts of climate pollution are accumulating in the atmosphere,
the United States has been hit with what may be two of its most
expensive hurricanes, and nations, which will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan
for climate negotiations, have failed to take strong action to change
these realities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the measures</p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act, the nation’s landmark climate law</p>
<p>This law is significant because it is expected to reduce U.S.
emissions by about 40% by 2030, if it unfolds as planned in the coming
years.</p>
<p>It funnels money to measures that substitute clean energy for dirty.
One major way it does so is by giving credits to businesses people who
build new solar and wind farms.</p>
<p>But it’s not limited to that. It encourages developers of geothermal
energy and businesses that separate the carbon dioxide from their
smokestacks and bury it underground. It incentivizes the next generation
of nuclear power. It gives a $7,500 tax credit to people who buy
electric cars. People who buy their cars used can get a credit too, as
long as they don’t earn too much to qualify.</p>
<p>Trump, by contrast, has summed up his energy policy as “drill, baby,
drill” and pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats’ “green new
scam” in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil,
natural gas and coal, the main causes of climate change.</p>
<p>He vows to end subsidies for wind power that were included in the
landmark 2022 climate law.</p>
<p>If Trump does target the climate law, there are provisions that are
likely safe. One is a credit for companies in advanced manufacturing,
because it is perceived as “America first and pro-U.S. business,” said
David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant
Baringa. Incentives for electric vehicles are likely most at risk, he
added.</p>
<p>Pollution from electric power plants</p>
<p>The main U.S. rule aimed at reducing climate change that comes from
making electricity at power plants that burn coal is also considered
vulnerable. This rule from the Environmental Protection Agency,
announced in April, would force many coal-fired plants to capture 90% of
their carbon emissions or shut down within eight years, Shepheard
said.</p>
<p>It was projected to reduce roughly 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon
dioxide through 2047, along with tens of thousands of tons of other
harmful air pollutants.</p>
<p>The United States has been reducing carbon dioxide emissions
primarily by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable
power, said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who
chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks
countries’ carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>“I hope that we don’t lose sight of the benefits of clean energy,” he
said. “It’s not just about the climate. It’s about our lives and our
health.”</p>
<p>Limiting leaks from damaging methane, or natural gas</p>
<p>The Biden administration was under pressure to reduce one of the main
pollutants contributing to drought, heat waves, flooding and stronger
hurricanes — methane or natural gas. It leaks out of oil and gas
equipment, sometimes deliberately when companies consider it too
expensive to transport.</p>
<p>The Biden administration issued the first national rules on this.</p>
<p>Industry groups and Republican-leaning states challenged the rule in
court. They say the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its
authority and set unattainable standards.</p>
<p>The EPA said the rules are within its legal responsibilities and
would protect the public.</p>
<p>Fuel-efficient vehicles</p>
<p>The EPA issued its strongest rules on tailpipe emissions from cars
and trucks under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Under Trump, the EPA is considered likely to begin a lengthy process
to repeal and replace a host of standards including the one on tailpipe
emissions, which Trump falsely calls an electric vehicle “mandate.”</p>
<p>Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto
industry and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don’t work in
cold weather and aren’t able to travel long distances. Trump softened
his rhetoric in recent months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed him and
campaigned heavily for his election.</p>
<p>Even so, industry officials expect Trump to try to slow a shift to
electric cars.</p>
<p>Drilling in Alaska refuge</p>
<p>Trump is almost certain to reinstate oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge, continuing a partisan battle that has
persisted for decades. Biden and other Democratic presidents have
blocked drilling in the sprawling refuge, which is home to polar bears,
caribou and other wildlife. Trump opened the area to drilling in a 2017
tax cut law enacted by congressional Republicans. No drilling has
occurred in the refuge, although the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on
Wednesday proposed a lease sale by the end of December that could lead
to oil drilling. The sale is required under the 2017 law.</p>
<p>Transition to cleaner energy, transport will continue</p>
<p>Trump, who has cast climate change as a “hoax,” has said he will also
eliminate regulations by the Biden administration to increase the energy
efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.</p>
<p>Dan Jasper, a senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown said climate
action will continue to move forward at the state and local level.</p>
<p>Zara Ahmed, who leads policy analysis and science strategy at Carbon
Direct, agreed. While there may be an abdication of leadership at the
federal level on climate, she’s optimistic that states including
California will continue to lead.</p>
<p>Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said Wednesday
that states, cities, utilities and businesses that have committed to net
zero emissions will keep working toward those goals, driving record
installations of wind and solar energy.</p>
<p>Governors of both parties are also interested in ramping up nuclear
energy as a carbon-free source of electricity, Cohen said.</p>
<p>Trump has said he, too, is interested in developing the next
generation of nuclear reactors that are smaller than traditional
reactors.</p>
<p>Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who was Biden’s first
national climate adviser, said Trump will be unable to stop clean energy
such as wind, solar and geothermal power.</p>
<p>“No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is
unstoppable and our country is not turning back,” McCarthy said.</p>

EPA Pick Hates Congestion Pricing and Loves Shellfish</h2>

<p>
When then-President-Elect Donald Trump nominated then-Oklahoma Attorney
General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency in
2016, everyone right, left, and center knew exactly what that meant: The
top law enforcement officer from one of the nation’s most conservative
states and largest oil and gas producers would take aim at environmental
rules implemented by the previous administration —
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/14/us/politics/document-Pruitt-v-EPA-a-Compilation-of-Oklahoma-14.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rules
he had often sued to overturn</u></a> — and pave the way to increased
fossil fuel production.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s pick this time around, former Long Island Congressman and New
York Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin, is more
distinguished by his personal closeness to and support for the
President-Reelect than he is by anything to do with the environment.
</p>
<p>
“It is an honor to join President Trump’s Cabinet as EPA Administrator.
We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to
bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,”
Zeldin
<a href="https://x.com/LeeMZeldin/status/1856068555865026956" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
on X</u></a> soon after the

York Post </em></em></u><u>broke the story</u></a>. He added for good
measure: “We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water.”
</p>
<p>
So, who is Lee Zeldin? In his four terms in Congress as the
representative from New York’s easternmost congressional district on
Long Island, Zeldin did not cut any particular profile on climate,
environment, or energy issues, and was best known for his hawkish
foreign policy position. His surprisingly close run against Kathy Hochul
for New York’s governor’s mansion in 2022 was largely defined by crime,
public safety, and the effect of Covid-19 restrictions on the state’s
economic recovery.
</p>
<p>
To the extent Zeldin <em><em>has</em></em> defined himself on the
environment beyond standard-issue Republican opposition to restrictions
on fossil fuels and car purchasing, it’s been in the context of issues
specific to his coastal Long Island constituency. During his 2018
congressional campaign, he pointed to his membership in the “shellfish
and national estuary caucuses,” as well as federal programs for
estuaries and his opposition to expanded offshore drilling exploration
at an event
<a href="https://patch.com/new-york/northfork/zeldin-gershon-face-environmental-issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hosted
by the League of Conservation Voters</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Throughout his gubernatorial run, Zeldin assailed New York’s ban on
fracking, which had been implemented by

Democratic congressional candidates on Long Island).
</p>
<p>
Cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder spent millions supporting Zeldin’s
gubernatorial run, which <em>The New York Times</em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/nyregion/hamptons-wind-farm.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a>

id="trump-breaks-republican-losing-streak-in-nations-largest-majority-arab-city">Trump
breaks Republican losing streak in nation’s largest majority-Arab
city</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DEARBORN, Michigan — Faced with two choices she didn’t like, Suehaila
Amen chose neither. </p>
<p>Instead, the longtime Democrat from the Arab American stronghold of
Dearborn, Michigan, backed a third-party candidate for president, adding
her voice to a remarkable turnaround that helped Donald Trump reclaim
Michigan and the presidency. </p>
<p>In Dearborn, where nearly half of the 110,000 residents are of Arab
descent, Vice President Kamala Harris received over 2,500 fewer votes
than Trump, who became the first Republican presidential candidate since
former President George W. Bush in 2000 to win the city. Harris also
lost neighboring Dearborn Heights to Trump, who in his previous term as
president banned travel from several mostly-Muslim countries. </p>
<p>Harris lost the presidential vote in two Detroit-area cities with
large Arab American populations after months of warnings from local
Democrats about the Biden-Harris administration’s unwavering support for
Israel in the war in Gaza. Some said they backed Trump after he visited
a few days before the election, mingling with customers and staff at a
Lebanese-owned restaurant and reassuring people that he would find a way
to end the violence in the Middle East. </p>
<p>Others, including Amen, were unable to persuade themselves to back
the former president. She said many Arab Americans felt Harris got what
she deserved but aren’t “jubilant about Trump.” </p>
<p>“Whether it’s Trump himself or the people who are around him, it does
pose a great deal of concern for me,” Amen said. “But at the end of the
day when you have two evils running, what are you left with?” </p>
<p>As it became clear late Tuesday into early Wednesday that Trump would
not only win the presidency but likely prevail in Dearborn, the mood in
metro Detroit’s Arab American communities was described by Dearborn City
Council member Mustapha Hammoud as “somber.” And yet, he said, the
result was “not surprising at all.” </p>
<p>The shift in Dearborn — where Trump received nearly 18,000 votes
compared with Harris’ 15,000 — marks a startling change from just four
years ago when Joe Biden won in the city by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. </p>
<p>No one should be surprised </p>
<p>The results didn’t come out of nowhere. For months, in phone calls
and meetings with top Democratic officials, local leaders warned, in
blunt terms, that Arab American voters would turn against them if the
administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war didn’t change. </p>
<p>The Biden-Harris administration has remained a staunch ally of Israel
since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200
Israelis and took over 200 hostages. The war between Israel and Hamas
has killed more than 43,000 people in Gaza, Palestinian health officials
say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. </p>
<p>While Harris softened her rhetoric on the war, she didn’t propose
concrete policies toward Israel or the war in Gaza that varied from the
administration’s position. And even if she had, that might not have made
much of a difference in places like Dearborn. </p>
<p>“All she had to do was stop the war in Lebanon and Gaza and she would
receive everyone’s votes here,” said Hammoud. </p>
<p>More voters thought Trump would be better able to handle the
situation in the Middle East than Harris, according to AP VoteCast, a
survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. About half of voters
named Trump as better suited, compared with about a third who said
Harris. </p>
<p>Among those who opposed more aid for Israel, 58% backed Harris in the
presidential election; 39% supported Trump. </p>
<p>Even some Harris voters had their doubts. About three-quarters of
Harris voters in Michigan said she was the better candidate to handle
the situation. Few preferred Trump, but about 2 in 10 Harris voters said
they were equivalent or neither would be better. </p>
<p>In the absence of support for Harris in the Arab American community,
Trump and his allies stepped in. </p>
<p>A key part of Michigan’s electorate — a state Trump won by nearly
11,000 votes in 2016 before he lost it by nearly 154,000 to Biden in
2020 — Arab Americans spent months meeting with Trump allies, who
encouraged community leaders to endorse him. </p>
<p>Things began to move in September, when Amer Ghalib, the Democratic
Muslim mayor of the city of Hamtramck, endorsed Trump. Shortly
afterwards, Trump visited a campaign office there. </p>
<p>That was a turning point, said Massad Boulos, who led Trump’s
outreach with Arab Americans. Boulos’ son Michael is married to Trump’s
daughter Tiffany. </p>
<p>“They very, very much appreciated the president’s visit and the
respect that they felt,” said Massad Boulos. “That was the first big
achievement, so to speak. After that, I started getting endorsements
from imams and Muslim leaders.” </p>
<p>An apparent shift toward Trump in final week </p>
<p>While support for Harris had been declining for months — especially
after her campaign did not allow a pro-Palestinian speaker to take the
stage at August’s Democratic National Convention — some voters say the
last week of the campaign was pivotal. </p>
<p>At an October 30 rally in Michigan, former President Bill Clinton
said Hamas uses civilians as shields and will “force you to kill
civilians if you want to defend yourself.” </p>
<p>“Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians, they
wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable,” he said. “Well,
I got news for them, they were there first, before their faith existed,
they were there.” </p>
<p>The Harris campaign wanted Clinton to visit Dearborn to speak in the
days following the rally, according to two people with direct knowledge
of the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were
not authorized to speak publicly about them. The potential visit never
materialized after backlash over Clinton’s comments. </p>
<p>“That comment was the talk of the town. It hurt many like me, who
loved him,” said Amin Hashmi, who was born in Pakistan and lives in
suburban Detroit. A self-proclaimed “die-hard Dem,” Hashmi said casting
a ballot for Trump “was a seismic move” that came after he stood in the
voting booth for 25 minutes. </p>
<p>On the Friday before the election, Trump visited The Great Commoner
in Dearborn, a Lebanese-owned restaurant. That stood in sharp contrast
with Harris, who met with Dearborn’s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud
— who didn’t endorse in the race — but never came to Dearborn
herself. </p>
<p>“He came up to Dearborn. He spoke with residents. Whether some people
say it wasn’t genuine, he still made the effort. He did reach out and
try to work with them, at least listen to them,” said Samia Hamid, a
Dearborn resident.</p>

There’s Drought Everywhere</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Of all the eerie paradoxes of climate change, one of the most unsettling
has got to be Christmas shopping in wildfire smoke.
</p>
<p>
This weekend, ice skaters seeking early holiday cheer in New York’s
Bryant Park did so not to the usual scent of honey-roasted nuts but to
the reek of brush fires burning in New Jersey, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.
When workers hoisted the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree into place on
Saturday, they did so in a
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-smoke-turn-the-sky-orange/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>strange
golden wash</u></a> of sunlight defused through smoke. In Queens, I
received
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/air-quality-index-what-you-need-to-know" target="_self"><u>an
air quality warning</u></a> while deleting early Black Friday emails
from my phone.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/weather/new-york-city-dry-october.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>driest
October in New York history</u></a> turned the region into a tinderbox
that has produced a whopping
<a href="https://pix11.com/news/morning/really-sad-jennings-creek-wildfire-burns-over-3000-acres-in-nj-ny/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>600
fires in the past month</u></a>. After one

in Prospect Park</u></a> on Friday, the city

closed. An 18-year-old New York State Parks employee died over the
weekend while
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/nyregion/orange-county-fire-sterling-forest.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clearing
dry underbrush</u></a> to help fight the 3,000-acre Jennings Creek Fire
in the Hudson Valley. And when rain finally <em><em>did</em></em> arrive
Sunday evening, it marked the first measurable precipitation in the
tri-state area since late September — but
<a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/1855985950805066050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
0.18 inches</u></a> wasn’t enough to alleviate
<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/rain-overnight-was-not-enough-to-help-drought-conditions-brush-fires/3430325/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
6- to 7-inch deficit</u></a> that has built up over the past two months,
city officials have asked New Yorkers
“<a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-politics-weather-mayor-eric-adams-dep-issue-citywide-drought-watch-urge-residents-start-conserving-water/15501098/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
to flush unnecessarily</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
New Yorkers will be piqued to learn their experience
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_of_the_World_from_9th_Avenue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>isn’t
singular</u></a>. The U.S. Drought Monitor’s
<a href="https://www.drought.gov/current-conditions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
recent report</u></a> found that as of the first week of November, every
state except Alaska was experiencing “moderate drought” conditions or
worse — the greatest number
<a href="https://earth.org/drought-conditions-affecting-all-us-states-except-alaska-and-kentucky-greatest-number-on-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>since
the Monitor’s record-keeping began</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center,
which runs the Monitor, told me it’s understandable to wonder where all
the rain has suddenly gone. “Three months ago, we only had a little over
21% of the country in drought, and in three months, that’s jumped to
just under 52%,” he said.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Map of U.S. drought." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="9895d93928645e4b809875a93c47a03f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="a26f7" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQ3MDA4My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTUyMDk0OH0.ibqmOvZwAvjsFENz3paPMEH_ctu24dohTUy2HkttFe4/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
Much of the country has been warmer than usual since the start of fall,
with some areas 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above average
“consistently,” Fuchs went on. “I’m in Nebraska, so typically in the
fall, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, it’s going to be cool in the morning, I’ll grab
a jacket, and maybe some nice sun in the afternoon will warm it up, and
then it’s cool in the evenings.’ And a lot of the country has not had
that. They’ve really had an extended summer.” Those increased
temperatures have also meant increased moisture loss, which is what
triggers a formal drought designation.
</p>
<p>
But while 2024 is
<a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc#:~:text=The%20global%20mean%20temperature%20in,2023%2C%20the%20current%20warmest%20year." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
track to be the hottest year on record</u></a>, the United States is
not, in fact, in one giant drought. Rather, “there are different
factors” driving several droughts happening simultaneously, Fuchs
explained. “It’s not all tied to the same mechanism.”
</p>
<p>
In the Northeast, for example, the drought is linked to
eastward-tracking storms dissipating before they reach the region, as
well as activity in the tropics during late September and October, which
robbed the atmosphere of moisture and contributed to “a stronger upper
high-pressure area dominant over the Ohio Valley, Midwest, Great Lakes,”
Paul Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, wrote to me in an
email on Friday. That high-pressure area has acted “like a block to
prevent any significant precipitation for weeks in these areas.” It’s
also why drought experts expect “potential improvement” in the coming
weeks.
</p>
<p>
There are severe drought conditions across the Southeast, too, which may
be a surprise if flooding from Hurricane Helene
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>is
still top of mind</u></a>. But much of that water quickly ran off into
streams, rivers, and the ocean, and “since then, there has not been a
lot of rain in this area, and the top soil has dried out,” Pastelok
said. Other areas experiencing drought include the Southwest, where a
mild summer monsoon season has
<a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/110524_drought_declaration/climate-experts-recommend-arizona-drought-declarations-stay-effect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extended
emergency declarations</u></a>, and the central and northern Plains,
which have been dry since early September and where drought conditions
are
<a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Drought/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected
to last</u></a> through at least the early winter. Reservoirs in
California, meanwhile, are in “great shape” after last winter’s snows;
still, due to “months without rain in many areas, the topsoil has dried
out, resulting in an abnormal dryness level — a lower category of
drought,” Pastelok said.
</p>
<p>
Brett Anderson, another senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, pointed out
that drought is a natural part of the climate cycle, and reassured me,
“This is not unprecedented.” He added that there is “no real trend in
U.S. drought severity over the past 25 years.”
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t mean these droughts don’t bear signs of climate change.
Fuchs noted that “rapid swings from very wet conditions to very dry
conditions, right on top of each other,” is a pattern associated with
global warming, and one that can be seen both in the post-Helene dry
spell in the Southwest and the deluge last week that broke up a drought
in Oklahoma and Missouri, which are having some of their
<a href="https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-rainfall-totals-okc-wettest-novembers/62853533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>wettest</em></em></u></a>
Novembers on record. Anderson also noted that the unusual warmth in many
parts of the U.S. has led to “much higher evaporation rates compared to
normal,” which also feeds the development of droughts.
</p>
<p>
As for New York City — again
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire#:~:text=A%20red%20flag%20warning%20signifies" target="_self"><u>under

bluebird day to go ice skating (and can ignore that it’s almost 70
degrees out), then now’s your chance.

id="young-black-latino-men-say-they-chose-trump-because-of-economy-jobs">Young
Black, Latino men say they chose Trump because of economy, jobs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Brian Leija, a 31-year-old small-business owner from
Belton, Texas, was not surprised that a growing number of Latino men of
his generation voted for Donald Trump for president this year. Leija had
voted for the Republican in 2016 and 2020. </p>
<p>Leija’s rationale was simple: He said he has benefited from Trump’s
economic policies, especially tax cuts. </p>
<p>“I am a blue-collar worker,” Leija said. “So, tax breaks for small
businesses are ideal for what I do.” </p>
<p>For DaSean Gallishaw, a consultant in Fairfax, Virginia, a vote for
Trump was rooted in what he saw as Democrats’ rhetoric not matching
their actions.  </p>
<p>“It’s been a very long time since the Democrats ever really kept
their promises to what they’re going to do for the minority
communities,” he said. </p>
<p>Gallishaw, 25, who is Black, also voted for Trump twice before. This
year, he said, he thought the former president’s “minority community
outreach really showed up.” </p>
<p>Trump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in
2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and most notably among men
under age 45, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than
120,000 voters. </p>
<p>Even as Democrat Kamala Harris won majorities of Black and Latino
voters, it wasn’t enough to give the vice president the White House,
because of the gains Trump made. </p>
<p>Economy, jobs made men under 45 open to Trump </p>
<p>Voters overall cited the economy and jobs as the most important issue
the country faced. That was true for Black and Hispanic voters as
well. </p>
<p>About 3 in 10 Black men under age 45 went for Trump, roughly double
the share he got in 2020. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men,
also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino
men voted for Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for
Biden. </p>
<p>Juan Proano, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the
nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization for Hispanic
Americans, said the election results make it clear that Trump’s
messaging on the economy resonated with Latinos. </p>
<p>“I think it’s important to say that Latinos have a significant impact
in deciding who the next president was going to be and reelected Donald
Trump,” Proano said. “[Latino] men certainly responded to the populist
message of the president and focused primarily on economic issues,
inflation, wages and even support of immigration reform.” </p>
<p>The Rev. Derrick Harkins, a minister who has served Abyssinian
Baptist Church in New York, has overseen outreach to Black American
religious communities for more than a decade. He said that Trump’s
hypermasculine appeal worked to win over some younger men of color. </p>
<p>“I think that Trump with this bogus machismo has been effective
amongst the young men, Black, white, Hispanic,” Harkins said. “And I
think unfortunately, even if it’s a very small percentage, you know,
when you’re talking about an election like we just had, it can be very
impactful.” </p>
<p>Black, Latino voters’ priorities changed from 2020 </p>
<p>While about 4 in 10 young voters under 45 across racial and ethnic
groups identified the economy as the top issue facing the country, older
white and Latino voters were likely to also cite immigration, with about
one-quarter of each saying that was the top issue. </p>
<p>A clear majority of young Black voters described the economy as “not
so good” or “poor,” compared with about half of older Black voters.
Majorities of Latino voters, regardless of age, said the economy is in
bad shape. </p>
<p>That belief made it more difficult for Harris to highlight the actual
numbers in the economy, which show that inflation has receded
dramatically, unemployment remains low and wages have risen. These
voters simply did not feel that progress. </p>
<p>This is the first time Alexis Uscanga, a 20-year-old college student
from Brownville, Texas, voted in a presidential election. The economy
and immigration are the issues that drove him to vote for Trump, he
said. </p>
<p>“Everything just got a lot more expensive than it once was for me,”
Uscanga said. “Gas, grocery shopping, even as a college student,
everything has gone up in price, and that is a big concern for me, and
other issues like immigration.” </p>
<p>Having grown up washing cars and selling tamales and used cars,
Uscanga knows how hard it can be to make a living. When Trump was
president, he said, it did not feel that way, he said. </p>
<p>“I was not very fond of President Trump because of his rhetoric in
2016, but I look aside from that and how we were living in 2018, 2019.”
Uscanga said. “I just felt that we lived a good life no matter what the
media was saying, and that’s why I started supporting him after
that.” </p>
<p>Though the shift of votes to Trump from Black and Latino men was
impactful, Trump could not have won without the support of a majority of
white voters. </p>
<p>“Men of color are really beginning to emerge as the new swing
voters,” said Terrance Woodbury, co-founder of HIT Strategies, a polling
and research firm that conducted studies for the Harris campaign. </p>
<p>“For a long time, we talked about suburban women and soccer moms who
can swing the outcome of elections. Now men of color are really
beginning to emerge as that, especially younger men of color, who are
less ideological, less tied to a single party, and more likely to swing
either between parties or in and out of the electorate,” Woodbury
said. </p>
<p>Desire for strong leadership  </p>
<p>A majority of voters nationally said Trump was a strong leader;
slightly fewer than half said the same about Harris. Among Hispanic
voters, even more saw Trump as strong in this election. Roughly 6 in 10
Hispanic men described Trump as a strong leader, compared with 43% who
said that in 2020. About half of Hispanic women said Trump was a strong
leader, up from 37%. </p>
<p>Black men and women were about twice as likely as in 2020 to describe
Trump as a strong leader. </p>
<p>David Means, a purchasing manager in Atlanta who is Black, abstained
from voting in the election because he did not feel either Harris or
Trump was making the right appeals to Black men. But the results of the
election did not disappoint him. </p>
<p>“I’m satisfied with the result. I don’t feel slighted. I wasn’t let
down. I wasn’t pulling for Trump or Kamala, but I did not want a woman
in that position,” he said. And if it were to be a woman, Means said,
“I’d rather have a really strong and smart woman, for example, like
Judge Judy.”</p>

id="california-voters-reject-measure-to-ban-forced-prison-labor">California
voters reject measure to ban forced prison labor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California voters have rejected a measure on
the November ballot that would have amended the state constitution to
ban forced prison labor.</p>
<p>The constitution already prohibits so-called involuntary servitude,
but an exception allows it to be used as a punishment for crime.</p>
<p>That exemption became a target of criminal justice advocates
concerned that prisoners are often paid less than $1 an hour for labor
such as fighting fires, cleaning cells and doing landscaping work at
cemeteries.</p>
<p>The failed Proposition 6 was included in a package of reparations
proposals introduced by lawmakers this year as part of an effort to
atone and offer redress for a history of discrimination against Black
Californians.</p>
<p>Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in the package in
September to issue a formal apology for the state’s legacy of racism
against African Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would
have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and Newsom
vetoed a measure that would have helped Black families reclaim property
taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain.</p>
<p>Abolish Slavery National Network co-founder Jamilia Land, who
advocated for the initiative targeting forced prison labor, said the
measure and similar ones in other states are about “dismantling the
remnants of slavery” from the books.</p>
<p>“While the voters of California did not pass Proposition 6 this time,
we have made significant progress,” she said in a statement. “We are
proud of the movement we have built, and we will not rest until we see
this issue resolved once and for all.”</p>
<p>George Eyles, a retired teacher in Brea who voted against Prop 6,
said he found it confusing that the initiative aimed to ban slavery,
which was outlawed in the U.S. in the 19th century. After finding out
more about the measure, Eyles decided it likely would not be
economically feasible since prison labor helps cut costs for upkeep, he
said.</p>
<p>“I really couldn’t get any in-depth information about … the thinking
behind putting that whole Prop 6 forward, so that made me leery of it,”
Eyles said. “If I really can’t understand something, then I’m usually
going to shake my head, ‘No.’”</p>
<p>Multiple states — including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont
— have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in
recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its
own measure.</p>
<p>In Colorado — the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery
from its constitution in 2018 — incarcerated people alleged in a 2022
lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still
being forced to work.</p>
<p>Proposition 6’s ballot language did not explicitly include the word
“slavery” like measures elsewhere, because the California Constitution
was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery. But the
exception for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remained
on the books.</p>
<p>The 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bans slavery and
involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime.</p>
<p>Proposition 6 saw the second-least campaign spending among the 10
statewide initiatives on the ballot this year, about $1.9 million,
according to the California Secretary of State’s office. It had no
formal opposition.</p>

<h2 id="fire-crews-on-both-us-coasts-battle-wildfires">Fire crews on
both US coasts battle wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RINGWOOD, New Jersey — Fire crews battled small wildfires across the
Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey
that killed a parks employee over the weekend and postponed Veterans Day
plans. Just over half a centimeter (1/4 inch) of rain fell overnight
from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between
the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters.</p>
<p>The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of
much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks,
Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting
firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree.</p>
<p>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in
California.</p>
<p>Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest
of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly
exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.</p>
<p>The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents
to flee their homes and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire’s size
remains about 83 square kilometers (around 32 square miles). The
Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them
homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation.</p>
<p>Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, the 12.2
square-kilometer (4.7 square-mile) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek
Wildfire was 10% contained as of midmorning Monday, and 25 structures
were considered threatened, although no evacuations had been ordered,
according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p>
<p>Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was
needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around
New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires
in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as
of Monday.</p>
<p>In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of
country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there
have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a
potential danger.</p>
<p>“Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff
is bone dry,” Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. “So
right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out.
But if it’s in the duff it’s going to stay there. It’s going to smolder
like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up
again.”</p>
<p>In some areas, narrow columns of white smoke could be seen creeping
out of a lakeside tree canopy Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>With the smell of smoke permeating the air in some areas, residents
negotiated a string of road closures, and even some firefighters
struggled driving on winding roads with weak cellphone signals.</p>
<p>A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters (350
gallons) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek
fire.</p>
<p>In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to
later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass,
the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander.</p>
<p>“Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are
veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts
as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order
protect our great communities in that area,” he posted online.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the
death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed
Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state’s Greenwood Lake.</p>
<p>Health advisories had been issued over the weekend for parts of New
York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to
unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions
improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind
gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the
Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 8.8
square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in the city some 16 kilometers (10
miles) north of Boston.</p>
<p>The Lynn Fire Department cited “a dry spell we have not seen during
this time of year in many years.”</p>
<p>“We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We
will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn’t spread further,”
Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.</p>
<p>The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New
Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a
hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday
night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred on
Sept. 28.</p>

Harriet Tubman posthumously named ‘general’ in Veterans Day
ceremony</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHURCH CREEK, Maryland — Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was
the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of
war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday. </p>
<p>Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground
Railroad State Park in Maryland’s Dorchester County for a formal
ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state’s
National Guard. </p>
<p>Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman’s
home state but for all the U.S.  </p>
<p>“Today, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of
veteran,” Moore said. “Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of
the American story.” </p>
<p>Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849, settling in Philadelphia in
1849. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the
Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men
to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and
nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black
soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. </p>
<p>Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in
Philadelphia and  </p>
<p>coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said. </p>
<p>“She knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go
into the lion’s den,” Moore said. “She knew that leadership means you
have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.” </p>
<p>The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning
ceremony with Tubman’s great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt. </p>
<p>Wyatt hailed her aunt’s legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and
agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other service
member. </p>
<p>“Aunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any
rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for
others,” Wyatt said. “She is a selfless person.” </p>
<p>Tubman’s status as an icon of history has only been further elevated
within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist
to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year.
In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing
the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put
Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall.</p>

House Republicans Who Lost Their Jobs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDQxNjUyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjY4Nzg3MX0.UQwbAFOdQPfmx8EoXcIFLzKay1uIYrbzrFcw6cveBOs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Since August, climate policy optimists have pointed to a letter sent by
18 Republican members of the House of Representatives to Speaker Mike
Johnson
<a href="https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/FINAL%20Credits%20Letter%202024.08.06.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imploring
him</u></a> to preserve the energy tax credits in the Inflation
Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
As of January, however, some of them will no longer be Johnson’s
problem.
</p>
<p>
Two signatories from newly redrawn House districts in New York, Marcus
Molinaro and Anthony D’Esposito, are out of a job already, beaten by
Democrats Josh Riley and Laura Gillen, respectively, each of whom
received an endorsement from the New York League of Conservation Voters.
Also definitively leaving the House is Utah Republican John Curtis,
founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, who is headed across the
hall to the Senate.
</p>
<p>
Of the remaining 15 Republicans, four are in races that still have not
been called, and three look to be in moderate-to-severe jeopardy. The
current chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, for instance, Iowa’s
Mariannette Miller-Meeks, is leading challenger Christina Bohannan by
just 0.2% —
i.e. <a href="https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/iowas-1st-congressional-race-still-up-for-grabs-as-of-now-no-recount-requested" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>799
votes</u></a> — with all precincts reporting. The state has no automatic
recount law, but candidates can request one at little to no expense when
the margin is within 1%; a spokesperson from the Iowa Secretary of
State’s office told a local TV network that if a request comes in, it’ll
likely be after the results are certified early this week. As Heatmap’s
Jeva Lange wrote in our
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results" target="_self"><u>climate
election tracker</u></a>, “Bohannan has attacked Miller-Meeks for
slow-walking action on addressing climate change through her soft hand
with the oil and gas industry,” and as of the final weeks of the race
was out-raising Miller-Meeks by a 2-to-1 ratio,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/conservative-climate-caucus-chair-in-danger-of-losing-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>E&amp;E
News</em></em></u><u> reported</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Another seat Democrats saw an opportunity to flip was Arizona’s 6th
Congressional District, where letter signatory Juan Ciscomani has, as of
this moment, squeaked out ahead of Democrat Kirsten Engel by 0.6% after
appearing to trail for much of last week, though that could change again
as more votes are counted. The news is worse for Oregon’s Lori
Chavez-DeRemer, however, who with 87% of precincts reporting is behind
Democrat Janelle Bynum in the vote by close to 3%.
</p>
<p>
If all these races were to be certified as they currently stand, that
would leave 14 of the original group of 18 representatives still in
Congress. If <em><em>all </em></em>the House races with results still
outstanding fall into line per their current leanings, then Johnson will
have just an 11-vote majority. That means this group of lawmakers can
still derail the House’s agenda if they so choose, though just barely.
</p>
<p>
As for the three House seats Republicans have flipped so far, two are in
Pennsylvania and one is in Michigan, both states Biden won in 2020. The
victors in the two Pennsylvania races, campaigned against the
“<a href="https://www.mackenzieforcongress.com/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>radical
climate agenda</u></a>” and the
“<a href="https://pennsylvaniaindependent.com/politics/house-representatives-rob-bresnahan-matt-cartwright-fossil-fuels-climate-change-stocks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
crazies</u></a>,” respectively. Yet the new representative from
Michigan’s 7th district, Tom Barrett, has earned a
<a href="https://www.michiganlcv.org/lawmaker/tom-barrett/" target="_blank">score
of 32%</a> from the Michigan League of Conservation Voters during his
time in the state Senate, making him a potential Conservative Climate
Caucus recruit. The group’s current chair, Miller-Meeks, has a LCV score
of
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/mariannette-miller-meeks" target="_blank">just
12%</a>.
</p>
<p>
So where does that leave us? About where we started, with the politics
of repeal teetering on a wind turbine blade-edge. It’s one thing to
campaign against the IRA, but the actual business of gutting is another
thing entirely. On election night, my colleague Robinson Meyer cited a
<em><em>Washington Post</em></em> analysis showing that Trump 2020
districts have received
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/climate-bill-biden-clean-energy/#:~:text=congressional%20districts%20that%20favored%20Trump%20in%20the%202020%20election%20received%20three%20times%20as%20much%20clean%20energy%20and%20manufacturing%20investments%20as%20those%20that%20leaned%20toward%20Biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
times as much</u></a> funding from Biden’s signature climate law as
those that went the other way. Though that won’t necessarily convince
every voter to welcome solar developments in their backyard, when the
margins of victory are this slim, every tenth of a percent of the vote
counts.

<h2
id="harris-appears-with-biden-for-first-time-since-election-loss">Harris
appears with Biden for first time since election loss</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden laid a wreath Monday to honor the nation’s
fallen soldiers on Veterans Day, an event marking his first appearance
with Vice President Kamala Harris since her election defeat last
week.</p>
<p>The ceremony, at historic Arlington National Cemetery across the
Potomac River from Washington, is also the first time Harris has been
seen in public since her Nov. 6 speech in which she conceded the
presidential election to Donald Trump.  </p>
<p>Democrats, facing a painful reckoning over their drubbing, have begun
soul-searching internal discussions — and some not-so-private blaming —
over what caused Harris’s loss, with some pointing to Biden’s initial
insistence on running again at age 81, despite having promised to be a
bridge president to the next generation.</p>
<p>Criticism of Harris herself has been more muted, and Biden heaped
praise on Harris last Thursday in a televised White House address.  </p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Biden hosted veterans at the White House to mark the
holiday before heading to Arlington, the final resting place of two
presidents, generals from all major U.S. wars, and thousands of other
military personnel.  </p>
<p>Biden and Harris, both dressed in dark suits, placed their hands on
their hearts before participating in a wreath-laying ceremony at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  </p>
<p>The president was to deliver remarks at the cemetery’s Memorial
Amphitheater.</p>
<p>The ceremony comes ahead of Biden hosting Trump at the White House on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Republican has begun naming loyalists to his new administration.
He announced he is bringing a hard-line immigration official, Tom Homan,
back into the fold to serve as his so-called “border czar,” and
congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.</p>
<p>Trump himself has long claimed he is a fierce supporter of America’s
military, but he has made a series of controversial comments about
veterans.  </p>
<p>His longest-serving White House chief of staff, retired general John
Kelly, has said the Republican leader privately disparaged U.S. service
members, including describing those who died or were imprisoned
defending America as “suckers” and “losers.”  </p>
<p>Trump denies the accusation.  </p>
<p>But the soon-to-be 47th president has been on record expressing
contempt for late American war hero and senator John McCain, who spent
years in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam war.</p>

Veterans own about 5.4% of businesses in this country, generating more

starting and running businesses, thanks to the skills they learned in

id="trump-names-us-border-czar-to-oversee-migrant-deportations">Trump
names US ‘border czar’ to oversee migrant deportations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Thomas Homan, his
one-time acting immigration chief, to serve as “border czar” and fulfill
his campaign vow to deport large numbers of undocumented migrants,
potentially millions, back to their home countries.</p>
<p>Trump said on his Truth Social media platform late Sunday that the
62-year-old Homan would be “in charge of our Nation’s Borders,” south to
Mexico and north to Canada. He added that he has “no doubt” that Homan
“will do a fantastic, and long-awaited for, job.”</p>
<p>“I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at
policing and controlling our Borders,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>Trump is also set to appoint another immigration hard-liner, Stephen
Miller, as deputy chief of staff for policy, U.S. news media
reported.</p>
<p>“This is another fantastic pick by the president,” Vice
President-elect JD Vance said of the prospect of Miller, 39, joining
Trump’s nascent administration.</p>
<p>In another appointment, Trump named one of his staunchest Republican
advocates in Congress, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, to
serve as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, calling her “an
incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.”</p>
<p>Stefanik, 40, arrived in the House of Representatives in 2015 as a
political moderate but over time has emerged as a vocal Trump
defender.</p>
<p>She drew national attention last year for her sharp questioning of
Ivy League university presidents over antisemitism on their campuses in
the wake of student protests against Israel’s conduct of its war on
Hamas militants. Two of the academics, the presidents of Harvard and the
University of Pennsylvania, stepped down in the fallout from the
hearing.</p>
<p>Trump also is expected to tap U.S. Senator Marco Rubio to be his
secretary of state, Reuters reported Monday, according to the sources,
who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Representatives for Trump and Rubio did not immediately respond to
requests for comment from Reuters.</p>
<p>Trump has asked U.S. Representative Michael Waltz to be his national
security adviser, The Associated Press reported, citing a person
familiar with the matter. Waltz, a retired National Guard officer, has
served as the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on
readiness and as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>
<p>Trump picked a former New York congressman, Lee Zeldin, 44, to head
the Environmental Protection Agency, saying he would “ensure fair and
swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash
the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the
highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on
the planet.”</p>
<p>Both Stefanik and Zeldin will face Senate confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>Homan’s appointment as “border czar” does not require Senate
confirmation, nor does Miller’s as a White House aide.</p>
<p>Homan served as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, or ICE, from January 2017 to June 2018 during Trump’s first
presidential term but left in frustration when the White House failed to
push his nomination toward the required confirmation in the Senate.</p>
<p>Homan, a former police officer and Border Patrol agent, subsequently
became a Fox News analyst on immigration and border issues.</p>
<p>Hours after his appointment, Homan on Monday told the “Fox &amp;
Friends” show: “I’ve been on this network for years complaining about
what [President Joe Biden’s] administration did to this border. I’ve
been yelling and screaming about it and what they need to do to fix
it.”</p>
<p>“So, when [Trump] asked me, ‘Would you come back and fix it?’ Of
course. I’d be a hypocrite if I didn’t,” he said. “I’m honored the
president asked me to come back and help solve this national security
crisis, so I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>Trump recaptured the White House in last week’s election after
repeatedly telling thousands of his supporters at campaign rallies that
he would round up undocumented migrants in the U.S. – perhaps 11 million
or more – and send them back to their home countries.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to seal up those borders,” Trump often said,
claiming that other countries had emptied their prisons and mental
health hospitals so migrants could flee to the U.S. He said the migrants
in the U.S. are now causing a crime wave. Government statistics show
that no such massive increase in crime has occurred.</p>
<p>In addition, immigration officials two months ago told Congress that
more than 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide — either in the United
States or abroad — are living in the U.S. outside of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement detention.</p>
<p>The immigrants are part of ICE’s “non-detained” list of migrants in
the United States.</p>
<p>Officials told Congress that means the migrants have pending
immigration cases in the U.S., but they are not currently in detention
either because they are not prioritized for detention, they are serving
time in a jail or prison for their crimes, or because ICE cannot find
them.</p>
<p>In another interview, Homan told Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures” show
that military troops would not be used to round up and arrest
undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>ICE, he said, would work to carry out Trump’s plans in a “humane
manner” in what will be a “necessary” and “well-targeted, planned
operation.”</p>
<p>Another Trump advocate, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN’s
“State of the Union” show on Sunday that deportation efforts would first
focus on 1.3 million migrants who have already had court hearings and
been rejected for asylum in the U.S., with Homeland Security agents and
local police arresting them.</p>
<p>Asked whether 3.6 million children who entered the U.S. with their
undocumented parents and have been living for years in the U.S. should
also be deported, Jordan said, “That question will be addressed later
on.”</p>
<p>Advocates for these migrants, now often young adults, call them
“Dreamers,” and some U.S. lawmakers have, unsuccessfully so far,
attempted to put them on a path to U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>In his first term, Trump had pledged to build a border wall and make
Mexico pay for it. Some of the wall was built but Mexico paid for none
of it.</p>
<p>In addition, he sought to deport millions of immigrants but fell far
short for lack of government financing, legal challenges brought by
advocates of migrants and a public outcry over deportation tactics,
including the separation of migrant children from their parents, a
policy that Homan advocated.</p>
<p>During his tenure as the acting ICE chief, Homan pushed back against
allegations that enforcement agents acted too aggressively. In the past,
Homan has praised Trump for “taking the shackles” off ICE agents by
allowing them to make a broader range of immigration arrests in the U.S.
interior.</p>

“the toughest climate talks in almost a decade,” as countries work to
set a new finance target to help developing nations adapt to climate
change. In 2022, industrialized nations pledged to provide $100 billion
annually for climate finance, and the new goal could run into the
trillions of dollars. Clashes are expected over how much money should be
paid and by whom, plus the mechanisms for managing and structuring the
funding. Donald Trump’s election win looms large at the event, with the
world’s largest economy and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter
expected to slow climate action under the next administration. Still,
COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said the finance target was the
meeting’s top priority. Negotiators are also likely to put the finishing
touches on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which calls for the
creation of a global carbon credit market. And there will be a big push
to get nations to outline their new Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs), or emissions reduction plans, well ahead of the February
deadline.

<li>Trump eyes Burgum for ‘energy czar’
</h3>
<p>
President-elect Donald Trump is considering North Dakota’s Republican
governor Doug Burgum for a position as “energy czar,” the
<em><em>Financial Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c390cc1-f5b8-4096-a361-c53d8145b85a?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_gag66RbTOvz3xqDoRQXXD9TuFXgD4qZhfHhok3T1ySqyIpZNBfn4cgHPHQmQj2eZfpwfj" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The role would replace that of National Climate Advisor – created by
President Biden and currently occupied by Ali Zaidi – and “coordinate
Trump’s deregulatory agenda across a patchwork of agencies including the
Department of Energy, Department of Interior, Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, and Environmental Protection Agency.” North Dakota is a
major oil producer, and Burgum is an “oil industry favorite” for the
role, the <em><em>FT</em></em> said.<span

from the International Chamber of Commerce found that extreme weather
related to climate change has cost the global economy more than $2
trillion over the last 10 years. The biggest losses, totaling about $935
billion, were felt in the U.S. And the costs have been growing faster in
more recent years. For example, in 2022 and 2023 alone, the economic
damages reached $451 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the annual
average of the 8 years that came before. And the number of
climate-related extreme weather events between 2000 and 2019 was 83%
higher than in the years between 1980 and 2000. “Our findings indicate
that without enhanced climate action and mitigation efforts, the
economic burden of climate-related extreme weather events will persist
and likely grow,” the report said. The ICC is a business organization
“championing the global economy as a force for economic growth, job
creation and prosperity.”<span class="redactor-invisible-space"></span>

<p class="drop-caps">
For decades now analysts of various stripes have been predicting the end
of America’s reign as the dominant world power. Some thought the war on
terror, in which the U.S. spent on the order of
<a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$6
trillion</u></a> turning half the Middle East into a Stygian wasteland,
would crack it. Others thought the financial crisis of 2008 would sour
the world on America-centered financial capitalism.
</p>
<p>
Yet nothing of the sort happened. America is simply so rich that it
absorbed the burden of 20 years of war without even raising taxes. There
was and is simply no alternative to the U.S. dollar for settling
international transactions. The 2008 crash caused a run
<em><em>towards</em></em> dollars, not away from them, and the U.S.
Federal Reserve became the lender of last resort for half the planet — a
role it replayed during the initial panic of the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
And under the Biden administration, American preeminence seemed to have
gotten another lease on life. Thanks to his stimulus and industrial
policy, the U.S. economy has recovered much faster than any other rich
nation. The European Union is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/european-union-risks-sad-bad-future-2024-09-16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stagnating</u></a>,
struggling to escape from its lack of a coherent fiscal system and its
decision to depend heavily on imported Russian fossil gas. China’s
growth model has crashed into the middle income trap, as it
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-economic-woes-give-markets-week-forget-public-little-cause-opti-rcna174466" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struggles
to pivot</u></a> from an investment-driven model to a consumption-driven
one.
</p>
<p>
That all changes with the second election of Donald Trump to the
presidency. Him winning again, this time even the popular vote, has
thrown radical uncertainty into America’s international standing —
particularly when it comes to climate change and the green economy. It’s
a golden opportunity for China, if it cares to seize it.
</p>
<p>
It has been obvious for years now that renewable energy and green
industry are going to be the growth engines of the world economy for the
rest of this century at least. Every fossil fuel power plant must be
replaced with some combination of wind, solar, batteries, geothermal, or
nuclear, and every power grid must be overhauled and upgraded to deal
with the intermittency of renewables. All carbon-based industry and
agriculture must be modified or replaced with electric-powered versions,
requiring a lot more generation capacity.
</p>
<p>
It will be a transformation on par in significance with the original
Industrial Revolution, requiring trillions in investment per year.
Indeed, it is already happening around the world and, given the price
trends of renewable energy, it is practically inevitable at this point.
</p>
<p>
China already has manifold advantages in this area. It is already the
workshop of the world, accounting for almost a third of
<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.CD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>global
manufacturing</u></a>. It produces
<a href="https://worldsteel.org/wp-content/uploads/World-Steel-in-Figures-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than half</u></a> of the world’s steel and
<a href="https://www.harboraluminum.com/en/top-aluminum-producing-countries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two-thirds
of its aluminum</u></a>. It is also far ahead of anyone else in most
green industry. It produces
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd8e7175-9423-4042-a6f7-c404afdfcda4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%</u></a>
of global solar panels,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-breaking-china-ev-supply-chain-dominance/?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%
of lithium-ion batteries</u></a>, about
<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/04/how-china-became-the-worlds-clean-tech-giant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60%
of wind turbines</u></a>, and
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>58%
of EVs</u></a>. It also has installed more
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/installed-solar-pv-capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1421763/global-wind-energy-generation-leading-countries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind</u></a>,
both onshore and offshore, than any other country by far.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, China was already positioned to more or less dominate the green
energy and industry space. But under Biden, America has belatedly
attempted to stand up a competing green manufacturing base, and it is
working. Solar and battery investment is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/soaring-us-tax-credit-deals-boost-solar-storage-build-2024-09-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skyrocketing</u></a>,
as is
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/C307RC1Q027SBEA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manufacturing</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Trump has promised to flush all that down the toilet. He has promised to
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed4b352b-5c06-4f8d-9df7-1b1f9fecb269" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repeal
the Inflation Reduction Act</u></a>, the keystone Biden climate law, and
gut the entire environmental protection apparatus. It’s an open question
whether or not he will go that far, but if markets are any judge, the
stocks of many American renewable and green industry companies
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/trump-market-ishares-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>plunged</u></a>
on the news of his victory. If Republicans win the House (which is not
yet counted at time of writing), then I suspect at least a partial
repeal of Biden’s climate achievements. That is basically
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what
Trump did</u></a> during his last term.
</p>
<p>
It might not even take that much. As
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/opinion/trump-electric-vehicles-china.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Robinson
Meyer outlines</u></a>, Trump already strangled an incipient transition
to EVs among U.S. automakers during his first term simply with some
regulatory adjustments. The ongoing transition has been rocky for some
companies, particularly Ford, and it would not take much to tip them
back towards traditional cars.
</p>
<p>
If that happens then China will not have even a potential peer
competitor — it will own more or less the whole green economy going
forward. European, Japanese, and Korean companies might carve out a
modest niche, but Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia will by and
large be decarbonized and powered by Chinese products.
</p>
<p>
China has an even bigger opportunity when it comes to diplomacy. The
keystone of American dominance is its alliance system. Its relationships
through NATO and with New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan,
and so on provides a public good of security in which those countries
feel less need to spend hugely on defense, in return to submitting to
U.S. control of global financial pipelines and other international
institutions.
</p>
<p>
Electing a madman as president back in 2016 led many to question whether
America was not too politically rotten to be trusted as world hegemon,
and sure enough Trump, with his arrogant, erratic, and supremely
transactional diplomacy, deeply alienated much of the EU, the most
important ally. Biden successfully patched up the relationship, but a
second Trump election could be the final straw. One election could be a
fluke, but two is a pattern, and in any case Trump
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
suggested</u></a> he might unilaterally tear up NATO. Frankly you’d be a
fool to trust American diplomatic promises of any kind from now on, and
a huge military buildup among jittery American allies is all but
certain. As French President Emanuel Macron
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-german-coalition-collapse-loom-large-european-leaders-meet-budapest-2024-11-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
said</u></a> at an EU summit, “We cannot delegate our security to the
Americans forever.”
</p>
<p>
This in turn threatens international financial pipelines, either owned
or regulated by the U.S. government, like Fedwire, CHIPS, Nacha, and
SWIFT, that the U.S. uses for power projection. Sanctions against
Russia, for instance, rely on other nations complying with American
rules and surveillance on these systems.
</p>
<p>
Many, many countries are not going to be happy about the prospect of
Donald Trump being able to set the rules and conditions on their
international transactions. It will be a ripe opportunity for China to
step in with an alternative system, and thereby knock out another pillar
of American global power.
</p>
<p>
Let me emphasize that none of this is going to happen automatically.
China, with its opaque and autocratic regime, has many serious domestic
problems. As noted above, its domestic economy is struggling to
rebalance towards consumption, and its population is rapidly aging. That
said, the government recently announced a
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2feba22-5064-4eb1-84b1-3003cac36def" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major
stimulus package</u></a>, which should boost consumption to some degree.
</p>
<p>
If China wanted to replace the dollar as reserve currency, it would have
to give up capital controls and currency management, which would require
even more wrenching reforms. Similarly, if it wants a lot of uptake on
an alternative payments system, it would be well advised to not give in
to its usual habit of totalitarian police state surveillance.
</p>
<p>
But the opportunity still remains. America has been one of the luckiest
countries in world history — blessed in its geographic position,
resource base, and with a 160-year record of not suffering major wars on
its territory. But with sufficient stupidity, even the largest
advantages can be canceled out. Electing one of the worst people in the
country to the presidency, again, might just do it.

got my life back’: Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service
dog program</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KANSAS CITY, Kan. — After working at a crowded and dangerous
internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O’Brien brought
home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get
back on her feet.</p>
<p>Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization
called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders
work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and
other challenges.</p>
<p>“A lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,” said
Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. “They’re
isolated. They’re very nervous. They won’t make eye contact. Some won’t
leave the house at all.”</p>
<p>The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is
to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and
understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans
regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders
also provide mental health therapy at no cost.</p>
<p>The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group
gatherings continue.</p>
<p>O’Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq
sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common
and it left her with severe anxiety.</p>
<p>“When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you’re supposed
to be on edge all the time as a veteran,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>O’Brien’s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and
convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later,
O’Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in
October 2023.</p>
<p>Now, O’Brien said she can get back out in public — she even went on
vacation to Branson, Missouri, “things that I never would have thought I
would do really, probably ever again.”</p>
<p>Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine
Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing
sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.</p>
<p>Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he
needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before
surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out
together and enjoy life.</p>
<p>“I don’t really like leaving the house because I’m safe there, you
know?” Atkinson said. “And having Lexi has just made me get out to be
more social.”</p>
<p>Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also
helped, Atkinson said.</p>
<p>“We come from the same backgrounds, different branches,” Atkinson
said. “Same issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And
they’re all very welcoming as well. There’s no judgment.”</p>
<p>O’Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes
pushy best friend who often wants to go out.</p>
<p>“The best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you
nervous,” O’Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to
her.</p>
<p>“I have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,” O’Brien said.
“And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but
it’s it’s getting manageable.”</p>
<p>Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since
they started the program.</p>
<p>“I’m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with
people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,” Atkinson said.
“Or even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.”</p>
<p>Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with
help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor,
which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army,
deploying 18 times.</p>
<p>“You’re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,”
Siebenmorgen said. “So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and
you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can’t do it on your
own.”</p>
<p>Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and
a renewed ability to move forward.</p>
<p>“I got my life back,” O’Brien said.</p>

id="trump-and-trade-worries-cloud-cop29-climate-summit-in-azerbaijan">Trump
and trade worries cloud COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baku, Azerbaijan — The annual U.N. climate summit kicks off Monday
with countries readying for tough talks on finance and trade, following
a year of weather disasters that have emboldened developing countries in
their demands for climate cash.</p>
<p>Delegates gathering in Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku are hoping to
resolve the summit’s top agenda item – a deal for up to $1 trillion in
annual climate finance for developing countries.</p>
<p>The summit’s negotiating priorities, however, are competing for
governments’ resources and attention against economic concerns, wars in
Ukraine and Gaza and last week’s U.S. re-election of Donald Trump, a
climate-change denier, as president of the world’s biggest economy.</p>
<p>COP29 host Azerbaijan will be tasked with keeping countries focused
on agreeing to a new global finance target to replace the current $100
billion pledge expiring this year.</p>
<p>The Caspian Sea nation, often proud of being home to the world’s
first oil wells, will also be under pressure to show progress from last
year’s COP28 pledge to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The country’s oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy
in 2023, down from 50% two years prior. The government says these
revenues will continue to decline, to roughly 32% of its GDP this year
and 22% by 2028.</p>
<p>Before the summit talks can even begin, countries will need to agree
on an agenda by consensus – including an 11th-hour proposal by China to
bring trade disputes into the mix.</p>
<p>The Chinese proposal - made on behalf of the fast-developing “BASIC”
group of countries including Brazil, India and South Africa - asked for
the summit to address “restrictive trade measures” such as the EU’s
carbon border tariffs going into effect in 2026.</p>
<p>Those concerns have been compounded by Trump’s campaign promise to
impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods – and 60% on Chinese goods.</p>
<p>China’s request showed it was flexing power following Trump’s
re-election, which signaled the United States’ likely disengagement from
global climate cooperation, said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub
at the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the U.S.
from the Paris Agreement, the global treaty to reduce planet-warming
emissions.</p>
<p>The European Union, along with current U.S. President Joe Biden’s
administration, have been pressing China and Gulf oil nations to join
the pool of climate finance donor countries.</p>
<p>“If the EU wants to talk about climate finance with China, if it
wants to talk NDCs, part of the conversation should be how to resolve
our differences on trade and your tariffs,” Shuo said.</p>
<p>Extreme pressure</p>
<p>With this year on track to be the hottest on record, experts noted
that climate extremes were now challenging rich and poor countries alike
– from flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of
North Carolina, to drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S.
West.</p>
<p>Most countries are not prepared.</p>
<p>“Election results don’t alter the laws of physics,” said Kaveh
Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the nonprofit
Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.</p>
<p>“Unless the world collectively steps up its efforts, the impacts of
climate change will become increasingly severe and frequent and will be
felt by an increasing number of people in all countries, including in
the United States.”</p>
<p>Many in Baku were worried that a U.S. disengagement could lead other
countries to backpedal on past climate pledges or to scale back future
ambitions.</p>

id="trump-pressures-candidates-for-senate-republican-leader-to-fill-cabinet-quickly">Trump
pressures candidates for Senate Republican leader to fill Cabinet
quickly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader,
President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the
rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate
vote.</p>
<p>Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and
Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday
to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime Republican leader Mitch
McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades.
All three have courted Trump’s support in the race, vying to show who is
the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority
leader.</p>
<p>Trump has not endorsed any candidate in the race, but Sunday he made
clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order,
if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement
on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader “must agree” to
allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing
a confirmation vote.</p>
<p>“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in
the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the
Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a
timely manner,” Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled
“IMMEDIATELY!”</p>
<p>The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess
appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president’s
power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief “pro-forma”
sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a
president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts
that have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>But with Trump’s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates
quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice.
Scott replied to Trump, “100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get
your nominations through as quickly as possible.” And Thune said in a
statement that they must “quickly and decisively” act to get nominees in
place and that “all options are on the table to make that happen,
including recess appointments.”</p>
<p>Cornyn said that “It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade
President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> ’s cabinet
appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends,
until they relent.” He noted that recess appointments are allowed under
the Constitution.</p>
<p>The social media exchange Sunday became a first test for the three
candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second
term.</p>
<p>Trump’s relationship with Congress — especially the advice and
consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was
tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his
selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now
entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he
is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by
extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet
selections.</p>
<p>Trump also posted Sunday that the Senate should not approve any
judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more
difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and
hold most of the votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3.
Trump posted that “Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as
the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.”</p>
<p>With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in
flux.</p>
<p>Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have
served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners,
despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of
Trump’s and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he
has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and
elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump’s endorsement.</p>
<p>Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco
Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and
other people who have Trump’s ear.</p>
<p>“We have to be the change,” Scott said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning
Futures.” “That’s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the
change.”</p>
<p>All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and
transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more
power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make
clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than
McConnell, who once called the former president a “despicable human
being” behind closed doors.</p>
<p>As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump’s Cabinet, many of his
allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential
candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC’s “This Week” that there are “a
couple of great options on the table.” Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican
from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and
2019, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that one of his greatest honors
was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would
advance “the positions that President Trump has articulated.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do that in whatever role necessary,” said Hagerty, who has
endorsed Scott in the leadership race.</p>
<p>While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming
Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for
top positions.</p>
<p>Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his
former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former
South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged
him for the Republican nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the
night before Election Day.</p>
<p>“I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously,
and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,” Trump
posted on his network Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster
Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to “keep all neocons and war hawks
out of the Trump administration.”</p>
<p>“The ‘stop Pompeo’ movement is great, but it’s not enough,” Smith
posted on X. “America First: screw the war machine!”</p>

<h2 id="dead-16-hurt-after-shooting-at-alabamas-tuskegee-university">1
dead, 16 hurt after shooting at Alabama’s Tuskegee University</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming
weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left
16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said. One
arrest was announced hours later.</p>
<p>The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of
Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus
shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion
device.</p>
<p>The agency’s statement said Myrick faces a federal charge of
possession of a machine gun. It did not say whether he was a student at
the historically Black university, where the shooting erupted in the
early hours on Sunday as the school’s 100th Homecoming Week was winding
down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university
student but that some of the injured were students.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if Myrick had an attorney who could
speak on his behalf.</p>
<p>Twelve people were wounded by gunfire, and four others sustained
injuries not related to the gunshots, the state agency said earlier.
Their conditions were not immediately released.</p>
<p>The FBI joined the investigation and said it is seeking tips from the
public, as well as any video witnesses might have. It set up a site
online for people to upload video.</p>
<p>Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been canceled.
Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university’s
chapel.</p>
<p>The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured
were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist
South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement.</p>
<p>An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state’s forensic
center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The
Associated Press on Sunday.</p>
<p>Tuskegee city’s police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured
included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student
who was shot in the arm.</p>
<p>City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off
campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the
West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said.</p>
<p>“Some idiots started shooting,” Mardis told the news site Al.com.
“You couldn’t get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many
people there.”</p>
<p>A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee’s police
chief said no other information was available.</p>
<p>“Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining
information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to
the shooting,” the state law enforcement agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn’t recall any
shootings during the school’s past homecoming celebrations. The mood
around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said.</p>
<p>The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said
Amare’ Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of
the student government association.</p>
<p>“This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether
directly or indirectly,” he said at the school’s homecoming convocation
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told
those at Sunday’s convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of
the fragility of life.</p>
<p>“It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand
on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don’t have
understanding,” said the Rev. James Quincy III.</p>
<p>“I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family,
this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we
shared this week,” Quincy said, “and most importantly because of that
faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in
the time of trouble.”</p>
<p>Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school’s opponent for
Tuskegee’s homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement
expressing sympathy.</p>
<p>“Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the
tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus,” the college said.
“We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for
healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult
time.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s shooting comes just over a year after four people were
injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex.
In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students
were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials
described as an “unauthorized party” in September 2023, the Montgomery
Advertiser reported.</p>
<p>About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles
(64 kilometers) east of Alabama’s capital city of Montgomery.</p>
<p>The university was the first historically Black college to be
designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also
designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school’s
website.</p>
<p>Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the
Sunday morning service that “we will get through this together because
in tough times, tough people band together and they survive.”</p>

<h2 id="biden-to-lobby-trump-not-to-walk-away-from-ukraine">Biden to
lobby Trump not to walk away from Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss top domestic and
foreign policy priorities with President-elect Donald Trump when the two
meet Wednesday, and will urge him not to abandon Ukraine, national
security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.</p>
<p>Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice
President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden
invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House
said.</p>
<p>In an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” show, Sullivan said
Biden’s top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer
of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what’s happening in
Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>“The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how
he sees things, where they stand, and talk to President Trump about how
President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes
office,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>While Sullivan did not specify which topics the two would discuss,
their conversation will almost certainly feature Ukraine’s war with
Russia, which Trump has pledged to end swiftly, although he did not say
how.</p>
<p>“President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to
make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that
the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away
from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>When asked if that means Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation
to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.
President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for
Ukraine beyond the end of his term,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Ukraine funding</p>
<p>Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S.
military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in
February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and
rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at
least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since
the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>Trump insisted last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin never
would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the
time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a
peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject, and Biden has never
suggested.</p>
<p>Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he was not aware
of any details of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to end the
Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail
major concessions for Kyiv.</p>
<p>According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress
appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the
aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take
control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority.</p>
<p>Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is
not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won
213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for
a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean most of
Trump’s agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through
Congress.</p>
<p>Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered
a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for
Ukraine in a CBS interview.</p>
<p>“The American people want sovereignty protected here in America
before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of
another nation,” Hagerty said.</p>
<p>The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say
could be its final act after Moscow’s forces advanced at the fastest
pace since the early days of the war.</p>
<p>Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of
some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the
war.</p>
<p>Moscow’s forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war
cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands
all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by

farmers enjoy pistachio boom, with much of it headed to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lost Hills, California — In a sprawling plant in the heart of
California’s farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and
onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and
shipped off to groceries around the world.</p>
<p>Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been
devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant
in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated
nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the
United States has surpassed Iran to become the world’s top exporter of
the nut.</p>
<p>“There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of
plantings, and those trees are coming online,” said Zachary Fraser,
president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which
represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. “You are
starting to see the fruit of people’s vision from 40 years ago.”</p>
<p>California grows more than a third of the country’s vegetables and
three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural
statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the
state’s sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime
crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.</p>
<p>Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat
during the Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are
eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation
ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold
with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey
roasted.</p>
<p>The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands
such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in
pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it
ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as
40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu,
president of Wonderful Orchards.</p>
<p>Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop,
he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of
dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with
pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts
hauled to a massive processing facility to be prepped for sale.</p>
<p>“There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,” Yraceburu
said. “The world wants more.”</p>
<p>Pistachios are poised to weather California’s dry spells better than
its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in
the state last year, industry experts said.</p>
<p>Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during
drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also
rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for
decades longer, Yraceburu said.</p>
<p>Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons
learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is
much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell
amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought
and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when
it came time to take them out.</p>
<p>Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are
striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example,
American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top
cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser
said.</p>
<p>The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers’ shift into
perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton,
according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of
California.</p>
<p>Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can’t just be
swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive
drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute’s Water
Policy Center.</p>
<p>But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don’t. They can go
longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them
appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much
groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the
critical resource, he said.</p>
<p>When farmers decide what to plant, “I think the biggest thing is the
market and where is the market,” Franklin said. “And water is right
below that.”</p>
<p>Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014
state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after
years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some
rural areas. About a fifth of California’s pistachio crop is grown in
areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu
said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out
of production.</p>
<p>But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to
continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into
production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are
stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David
Magana, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.</p>
<p>Pistachios require about 3,700 cubic meters (3 acre-feet) of water
per 0.4 hectares (acre) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic
meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while
fetching a higher price, he said.</p>
<p>“You see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to
California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less
acreage,” Magana said. “I haven’t seen pistachio orchards being pulled
out.”</p>

York parks employee dies fighting fires as air quality warnings issued
in region</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>POMPTON LAKES, N.J. — A New York parks employee died battling one of
a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions
that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said
Sunday. </p>
<p>The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he
battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border,
according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue
and the New York state forestry services. </p>
<p>“Rip brother your shift is over job well done,” the New York State
forestry services post said. </p>
<p>New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the
fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the
victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide
employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic
Preservation Department. </p>
<p>The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also
battling a wildfire in California. </p>
<p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s Forest Fire
Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 10 square kilometers
near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New
York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek
wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as
two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state’s Long Pond
Ironworks Historic District. </p>
<p>Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New
York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due
to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor
physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the
very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and
heart disease. </p>
<p>New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a
70-hectare fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was
threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. </p>
<p>Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the
border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees
townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood
Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro
wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. </p>
<p>Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced
arson and firearms charges in connection with a 142-hectare Jackson
Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by
magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range.
Officials said firing that kind of “incendiary or tracer ammunition” was
barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained,
officials reported Friday. </p>
<p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind
gusts and dry leaves burned more than 81 hectares in the Lynn Woods
Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 8.8 square kilometers
in the city 16 kilometers north of Boston. </p>
<p>“This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in
many years,” the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social
media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its
intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the
ground. </p>
<p>It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In
Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert
Hills State Forest would be a “a multi-day event.” </p>
<p>Wind gusts topped 64 kph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts
continued Sunday. </p>
<p>Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning. </p>
<p>The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually
all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being
abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain
Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast,
said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs. </p>
<p>Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes
over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned
more than 100 structures. </p>
<p>Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in
several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at about
83 square kilometers and was 26% contained, authorities said.</p>

<h2 id="donald-trumps-us-presidential-victory-was-sweeping">Donald
Trump’s US presidential victory was sweeping</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In the end, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory
in last week’s 2024 national election for a new four-year presidential
term in the White House was sweeping.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, national polling showed Vice President
Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Trump, maybe a percentage point or
two, depending on the survey.</p>
<p>Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, a Republican, were
virtually deadlocked, the surveys indicated, in seven political
battleground states that election analysts viewed as critical to the
election outcome.</p>
<p>Trump, however, captured all seven states, leading to his lopsided
edge in the state-by-state vote count in the Electoral College, 312 to
226, which determines the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. The
number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. He won the seven
battleground states by a range of just under 1% in Wisconsin to more
than 6% in Arizona.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>On January 20, 2025, the 78-year-old Trump will take office as the
country’s 47th president and the first president to win two
nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. He is the
oldest elected president in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Trump also won the popular vote, the first Republican candidate to do
so since former President George W. Bush in 2004.</p>
<p>While the last ballots are still being counted, Trump already is the
clear winner, capturing nearly 75 million votes so far to just under 71
million for Harris, a 50.5% to 47.9% edge for Trump.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2024 vote tally was about the same as the 74 million he
received in losing the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden,
but the vote for Harris was about 10 million fewer than Biden
received.</p>
<p>U.S. pollsters often like to say their surveys are just a snapshot in
time, and not necessarily predictive.</p>
<p>But over Trump’s three runs for the presidency since 2016, his level
of support has consistently been underestimated in polling, no matter
how many times pollsters have tried to adjust their published results to
account for a hidden Trump vote from people unwilling to tell even
anonymous surveyors that, yes, when they went to polling centers or cast
mail-in ballots, he was their choice.</p>
<p>Exit polls showed that women voters favored Harris and men Trump.
More educated voters went for Harris, while those without college
degrees voted for Trump, but nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have
a college degree.</p>
<p>In amassing his majority vote, Trump cut into two traditional
Democratic constituencies, Black and Latino voters.</p>
<p>According to The Associated Press’ VoteCast survey of voters, 16% of
Black voters supported Trump in 2024, double that from his 2020
campaign. In comparison, 83% of Black voters supported Kamala Harris,
down from the 91% who supported Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>Democrats also lost ground among Latino voters, with 56% voting for
Harris in 2024 compared to 63% for Biden in 2020. Trump’s support grew
from 35% four years ago to 42% this year.</p>

<p>Washington — Editor’s note: Here is a look at immigration-related
news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA
immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.</p>
<p>What to expect on immigration under a new Trump administration</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump put immigration at the front of his
campaign agenda, pledging to bring what he calls “unprecedented order”
to the southern border and launch the nation’s largest mass deportation
operation of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office. VOA
immigration reporter Aline Barros has more.</p>
<p>US judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant
spouses</p>
<p>A U.S. judge in Texas ruled Thursday against President Joe Biden’s
program offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of
U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program blocked through
Biden’s final months in office. U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker
found the program exceeded Biden’s executive authority. The program
offers a path to citizenship to about 500,000 immigrants who entered the
U.S. illegally if they are married to U.S. citizens. Reuters
reports.</p>
<p>After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota Capitol</p>
<p>Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first
Kenya-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives.
She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination
and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol
for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA
she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an
elected official. Produced by Abdushakur Aboud.</p>
<p>Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious
minutes</p>
<p>Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the
U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they
had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears
flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite
for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S.
Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved
ones. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico</p>
<p>A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off Tuesday from
southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S.
voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris
and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election
campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula,
the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with
messages such as “NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD” and images of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico,
according to witnesses. Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Ukrainian physicians find homes – and jobs – in Latvia</p>
<p>More than 160,000 Ukrainians fled their home country and headed to
the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the Russian
invasion. Physicians were among the 50,000 or so refugees who went to
Latvia. Vladislavs Andrejevs spoke with some of them in Riga. Anna Rice
narrates his story.</p>
<p>Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UN agency for
Palestinian refugees</p>
<p>Near-universal concern and condemnation have followed Israel’s formal
announcement to the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the
U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament voted to
cut ties last week. In Washington, at the U.N. and on the ground,
officials and residents are raising alarms over the disintegrating
humanitarian situation in Gaza and elsewhere. VOA White House
correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.</p>

id="schoolhouse-for-black-us-children-holds-complicated-history-of-slavery-resilience">1760
schoolhouse for Black US children holds complicated history of slavery,
resilience</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished
restoring the nation’s oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children,
where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a
curriculum that justified slavery. </p>
<p>The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80
children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. </p>
<p>They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness
maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3,
was the property of local tavern keepers. </p>
<p>Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper
ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee “can read.” </p>
<p>The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony
on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial
Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia’s colonial capital through
interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. </p>
<p>‘An amazing mirror’</p>
<p>Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside
the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic
moments of the last decade. </p>
<p>“History is an amazing mirror,” Bunch added. “It’s a mirror that
challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we’ve achieved, despite
all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an
amazing work it is.” </p>
<p>The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of
its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about
race and education, but also resistance, before the American
Revolution. </p>
<p>The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and
encouraged children to accept their fates as God’s plan. And yet,
becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to
share what they learned with family members and others who were
enslaved. </p>
<p>“We don’t shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school,”
said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William &amp; Mary’s Bray School
Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. </p>
<p>But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st
century. </p>
<p>“It’s a story of resilience and resistance,” Lee said. “And I put the
resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to
today.” </p>
<p>To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the
students, with some success. </p>
<p>They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum’s African
American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the
students Elisha and Mary Jones. </p>
<p>“It grounds you,” said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection
to history. “That’s where your power is. And those are the things that
give you strength — to know what your family has come through.” </p>
<p>Franklin’s idea</p>
<p>The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial
cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He
was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after
Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. </p>
<p>The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across
much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing
literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. </p>
<p>The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann
Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3
to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. </p>
<p>The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into
William &amp; Mary’s growing campus. The building was moved and expanded
for various purposes, including student housing. </p>
<p>Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific
method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported
to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original
city. </p>
<p>The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse,
researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former
students. </p>
<p>The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby
families, two free Black households that had students in the school,
said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab’s genealogist. </p>
<p>But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were
stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there
are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have
survived. </p>
<p>They ‘weren’t considered people’</p>
<p>Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family
histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century
property records, tax documents and enslavers’ diaries. </p>
<p>“When you’re talking about researching formerly enslaved people,
records were kept very differently because they weren’t considered
people,” Drembus said. </p>
<p>Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity
cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an
associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. </p>
<p>Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was
located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to
syllables, such as “Beg leg meg peg.” </p>
<p>Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in
sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian
texts. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the
original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the
children and teacher placed their feet. </p>
<p>Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students,
wondered on a recent visit if any of the children “felt safe in here,
whether they felt loved.” </p>
<p>Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two
kids. </p>
<p>“Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those
children?” Canaday said. “There are moments when we forget to go by the
rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in
these spaces.”</p>

id="with-holidays-approaching-us-stores-stock-more-supersize-tv-sets">With
holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does
matter.</p>
<p>Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than
average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and
retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4
meters diagonally. That’s wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a
king-size bed.</p>
<p>Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV
set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year,
according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for
shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to
think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise
tepid television market, according to analysts.</p>
<p>The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between
January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same
period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer
electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models
range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in
roughly 70% of its stores.</p>
<p>“It’s really taken off this year,” Blake Hampton, Best Buy’s senior
vice president of merchandising, said.</p>
<p>Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much
lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at
least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according
to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its
first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it
now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.</p>
<p>Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling
business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his
1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost
about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV
in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home
and uses some to display digital art.</p>
<p>“We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking
for and thought, ‘Why not?’” he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony.
“You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You’re sitting
watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can
put yourself in the scene.”</p>
<p>The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones
and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor
driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue
fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through
September period, Circana said.</p>
<p>Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when
they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski,
the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology
Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were
shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a
year, Kowalski said.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people
spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5
centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining
traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs
to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292
centimeters are on the market right now, he said.</p>
<p>“You get better resolution over time,” Kowalski said. “You get better
picture quality. And so just over time, it’s easier to produce those
sets and improve the technology.”</p>
<p>Best Buy’s Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can
watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as
“incredible.”</p>
<p>“If you’re watching YouTube TV content or ’ NFL Sunday Ticket,’ you
can actually get four screens up, and that’s four 48-inch
(122-centimeter) screens on it,” he said.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed
its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer
is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every
scene.</p>
<p>James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment
division of Samsung’s U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and
experience content is shifting.</p>
<p>“It’s even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,” Fishler
said. “They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to
watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at
home.”</p>
<p>Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, its Sam’s Club division, and
Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV
ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.</p>
<p>TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach
on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image
that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without
windows.</p>
<p>“A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the
purview of projectors,” Andrew Sivori, vice president in the
entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer.
“But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.”</p>
<p>Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from
millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd.
But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, “It’s still a
niche business.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people just don’t have the space to put one of those in,”
he added.</p>
<p>Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make
sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team
asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate
delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy
app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been
especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.</p>
<p>But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good
news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is
actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of
thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine
the ideal viewing distance, Samsung’s Fishler said.</p>
<p>If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?</p>
<p>“I think we’ll have to wait and see,” Fishler said.</p>

Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it
decisively</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán’s family has lived on the
U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he
can remember.</p>
<p>He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump
because he doesn’t trust the Democratic Party’s economic policies.</p>
<p>“I think they forgot about the middle class,” said Bazán, who works
for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic
county in the nation. “People are suffering right now. Everything’s very
expensive.”</p>
<p>The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio
Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward
Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area,
where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in
local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment
that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the
border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in
the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
<p>In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican
presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The
predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median
household income of $36,000 that’s one of the lowest in the nation, gave
Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala
Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas’ southernmost point,
among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents
patrolling the border.</p>
<p>Trump’s victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how
working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That
includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued
that Trump’s promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off
voters.</p>
<p>“I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to
Republican with the political landscape that it is now,” said Luis Meza,
a 32-year-old Starr County voter. “I felt that going Republican was the
better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything
like that that’s going on.”</p>
<p>Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few
changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris.</p>
<p>Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary
Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of
dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by
Democratic policies.</p>
<p>A similar scenario played out in the state’s three most competitive
races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a
decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other
races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a
political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade
career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted
this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000
from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion
restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the
House.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an
opponent he comfortably beat two years ago.</p>
<p>Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to
support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to
AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris,
but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in
2020. Trump’s support among those groups appeared to rise slightly
compared to 2020.</p>
<p>In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the
promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican
presidential candidate for the first time.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see change and that’s why I did vote for Trump. I did
vote red. I would not call myself a Republican” Borrego, 37, said. He
said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie
Sanders in prior elections.</p>
<p>Borrego’s whole family voted Trump.</p>
<p>“We just (made) this choice, because we didn’t have another choice
that we felt comfortable with,” he said.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region
during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a
victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving
the Democratic Party because of immigration.</p>
<p>“They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They
understand something the liberal elites never will: There’s nothing
progressive about open borders,” Cruz said. “There is nothing Latino
about letting criminals roam free.”</p>
<p>Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights
group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage
Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them.</p>
<p>“I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to
have those conversations with Latino households and families.” Mireles
said in Hidalgo County after Election Day.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait for a big election to have those conversations. By
that point, it’s too late.”</p>

id="floridas-iconic-key-deer-face-uncertain-future-as-seas-rise">Florida’s
iconic Key deer face uncertain future as seas rise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world’s only Key deer, the smallest
subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy
wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the
Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by
vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads.</p>
<p>But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest
long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes
their sole habitat.</p>
<p>These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for
almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and
poaching long ago. Yet they’ve made a tremendous comeback, with a peak
population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and
Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll.</p>
<p>However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success
story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise
is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20
smaller islands the deer call home.</p>
<p>The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48
kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500
people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets
residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle.</p>
<p>Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with
the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and
weighing around 34 kilograms.</p>
<p>“They were always vulnerable,” said Chris Bergh, the South Florida
program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise
projects and lives in Big Pine Key. “They’re much more vulnerable now.
And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they’re
becoming even more so.”</p>
<p>Highway deer deaths</p>
<p>On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of
bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main
industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving,
vacation rentals.</p>
<p>To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists
they’re entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is
elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed
limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key
West.</p>
<p>Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. “The bottom line is that
some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year,” said
Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don’t feed
Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for
handouts.</p>
<p>Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But
a larger threat looms.</p>
<p>Climate change impacts on deer</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by
2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The
threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the
highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer
need to survive, experts say.</p>
<p>“So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available
freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places
for bearing their young,” said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. “It puts
them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those
higher grounds.”</p>
<p>In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger
hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and
freshwater supplies.</p>
<p>Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the
Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are
growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer
habitat even more.</p>
<p>Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods</p>
<p>Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on
gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their
yards.</p>
<p>“They are very gentle, very, very gentle,” said Connie Ritchie, who
sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. “And the longer you live here, the
more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they’re so
innocent.”</p>
<p>“They have certain plants that they really love,” Ritchie said,
noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives
away native plants. “So they’re trying to teach us to plant the plants
that the deer won’t eat.”</p>
<p>Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s “when entire
swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into
planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide
lot-buyers with direct water access,” said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key
Deer.</p>
<p>While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and
more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat.</p>
<p>“We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really
concentrated area,” said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National
Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key.
“So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have
protected, the less areas that they have that are safe.”</p>
<p>The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild
spaces and the neighborhoods. “They roam, they spend their day grazing,”
Hosokawa said. “We don’t have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they
need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they’re
very good at it. If it’s soft and tender, they will try to eat it.”</p>
<p>Future of the deer</p>
<p>The future, while uncertain, looks grim.</p>
<p>Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of
16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor
emeritus with Texas A&amp;M University who has studied Key deer since
1968 and has lived here for several years.</p>
<p>By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805
hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and “the deer will
already be gone,” Silvy said.</p>
<p>What happens if the deer can’t survive in the Keys?</p>
<p>Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here.
“And at some point, if that’s no longer possible, I personally think
zoos are the most responsible alternative,” he said. “But that’s a
terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?”</p>
<p>In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate
endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But
Silvy said, “The problem is if you take them any other place with deer,
they’re going to interbreed and then you’ve lost the Key deer.”</p>

<h2 id="why-ap-called-arizona-for-trump">Why AP called Arizona for
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald
Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in
Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state
out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris,
52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win
about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots
remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were
counted.</p>
<p>Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential
battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris.
The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270.</p>
<p>In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump,
but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On
Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47.</p>
<p>The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing
candidate can’t close the gap and overtake the vote leader.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how the AP called this race:</p>
<p>Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver
(Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).</p>
<p>Winner: Trump.</p>
<p>Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes
until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are
closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state,
where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election
Day.</p>
<p>Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to
deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for
pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.</p>
<p>Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by
Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate
contests and the governorship since 2018.</p>
<p>Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than
70 years.</p>
<p>Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is
home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in
2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is
primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of
the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.</p>
<p>Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen
years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and
losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far
underperformed Biden’s showing from 2020.</p>
<p>She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won
in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic
candidates in recent elections.</p>
<p>Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on
election night, Trump has consistently led since then.</p>
<p>The AP’s analysis of Arizona’s voting history and political
demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would
allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if
remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris’ favor, they would not be
enough to give her the lead.</p>

<h2 id="trump-completes-swing-state-sweep-by-taking-arizona">Trump
completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week’s
U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday,
completing the Republican’s sweep of all seven swing states.</p>
<p>After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large
Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11
electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in
Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in
office.</p>
<p>The scale and strength of Trump’s comeback, which also saw the real
estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million
votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look
well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to
support from white working-class voters and a large share of
Hispanics.</p>
<p>CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with
218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber.</p>
<p>The networks’ figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior
party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that
would significantly curtail Trump’s powers.</p>
<p>NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the
Democrats.</p>
<p>The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and
Georgia.</p>
<p>The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden
would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump – who never conceded his 2020 loss – sealed a remarkable
comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set
to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline
right-wing stance.</p>
<p>This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was
considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after
making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the
January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.</p>
<p>Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden’s inauguration, but
the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the
upcoming ceremony.</p>
<p>Biden’s meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the
White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the
ex-president’s return to power.</p>
<p>Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than
before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office
and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.</p>
<p>Exit polls showed that voters’ top concerns remained the economy and
inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in
July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump
on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win.</p>
<p>Trump 2.0</p>
<p>Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris’
decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly
100 days before the election.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New
York Times that “had the president gotten out sooner, there may have
been other candidates in the race.”</p>
<p>As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble
his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to
serve as his White House chief of staff.</p>
<p>She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the
Republican’s first appointment to his incoming administration.</p>
<p>Jockeying for jobs</p>
<p>Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his
first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a
front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator
Marco Rubio who called Trump a “con artist” and the “most vulgar person
to ever aspire to the presidency” in 2016.</p>
<p>The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration
reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement.</p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement
for whom Trump has pledged a “big role” in health care, told NBC News on
Wednesday that “I’m not going to take away anybody’s vaccines.”</p>
<p>The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job
auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss
enthusiastically backed Trump.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-his-administration">Trump
says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former
Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. </p>
<p>“I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which
is currently in formation,” Trump posted on social media. “I very much
enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to
thank them for their service to our country.” </p>
<p>Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his
administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters
reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent,
who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. </p>
<p>Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite
having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party
primaries.  </p>
<p>Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence
Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a
possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican
presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not
run. </p>
<p>Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on
Saturday. </p>
<p>During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel
announcements via social media posts. </p>
<p>Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be
co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and
former Senator Kelly Loeffler.</p>

<h2 id="record-13-women-will-be-governors-in-us-next-year">Record 13
women will be governors in US next year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire’s governor
means 13 women will serve as a state’s chief executive next year,
breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state
policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch
campaigns for higher offices.</p>
<p>“It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of
women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive
leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team,”
said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for
American Women and Politics.</p>
<p>Governor Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic
nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race.
Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was thought to be in the
running for President-elect Donald Trump’s vice presidential post.</p>
<p>Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce
Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.</p>
<p>Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office.</p>
<p>“This is another side of political leadership where women continue to
be underrepresented,” Dittmar said. “Thirteen out of 50 is still
underrepresentation.”</p>
<p>With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for
female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of
electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first
all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have
a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same
time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will
be the state’s third woman to be governor.</p>
<p>“Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona,”
Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said
of Ayotte.</p>
<p>Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the
campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and
center.</p>
<p>In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both
candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said
she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire
where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor
at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats.</p>
<p>New Hampshire’s was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races
among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s
representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect
governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty
and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female
candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely
avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman’s intelligence,
appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens.</p>
<p>The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice
President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female
president.</p>
<p>“I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because
she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman,” Dittmar
said. “We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t
acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign
overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated
by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other
spaces.”</p>
<p>Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like
commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must
work harder to overcome, Dittmar said.</p>
<p>Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in
executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state
legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders,
filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs.</p>
<p>“Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never
why one voter acts one way or another,” said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote
Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state
legislatures. “But we have so much of that built in to how we see a
leader.”</p>
