<p>A federal judge in Oregon on Friday blocked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> from deploying national guard troops to Portland, ruling there was no evidence of widespread violence to justify federal intervention.</p>
<p>The US district court judge, Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, delivered her final order in the case on Friday. She found that protests near Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility were “predominately peaceful, with only isolated and sporadic instances of relatively low-level violence”.</p>

<p>Republicans rejected a proposal made on Friday by the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, which would end the longest government shutdown in US history by offering Republicans a deal to reauthorize funding in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.</p>
<p>“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes healthcare affordability,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Leader Thune just needs to add a clean, one-year extension of the ACA tax credits to the CR so that we can immediately address rising healthcare costs.”</p>

A desperate woman in the passenger seat tries to awaken the man in the driver’s seat, with a crying child in the middle. People can be heard shouting: “He’s having a seizure.” An officer can be seen trying to pull the passengers from the vehicle, while a Fitchburg police officer orders the crowd to “back up” repeatedly.</p>

      <h1>Consumer sentiment hits three-year low</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Consumer sentiment — as in, how everyday people feel about the economy — fell to a low not seen since 2022, according to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers. The decline was consistent across demographics, except among the wealthiest Americans (as measured by volume of stock market holdings). In other words, economic mood just became another k-shaped indicator.

      <h1>James D Watson, who co-discovered DNA’s twisted-ladder structure, dies aged 97</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Nobel prize winner shaped medicine, crimefighting and genealogy, but later years marred by racist remarks</p>
<p>James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.</p>
<p>The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.</p>

      <h1>WTA Finals tennis: Sabalenka beats Anisimova to set up final with Rybakina – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Aryna Sabalenka came through a gripping three-set battle with Amanda Anisimova and will face Elena Rybakina, who fought back to defeat Jessica Pegula in the first semi-final</p>
<p><strong>First set: Pegula 2-2* Rybakina (*denotes next server)</strong> Rybakina had started the stronger but lost her way in that last service game. Can Pegula back up the break? An early double fault doesn’t help matters, and Rybakina outlasts her in a rally to earn break point. From the middle of the court, Rybakina lands an inside-out forehand on the line, and we’re back on serve.</p>
<p>Cam Norrie is playing in the Metz semi-finals; he’s trailing Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 0-1. In Athens, Novak Djokovic is facing Yannick Hanfmann; it’s on serve in their semi-final.</p>

<p>NBA Europe managing director George Aivagolozu, speaking at a conference in Milan, said the first season of the new league might be described as “a semi-opening”, indicating that not all of the slots in the planned 16-team league could be allocated at that time.</p>

      <h1>NCAA bans six men’s basketball players for manipulating performances in betting scheme</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>Six NCAA players banned for prop-bet scheme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation found altered play, leaked info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follows earlier bans at Fresno St and SJSU</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men’s college basketball players for allegations of sports betting on Friday in three separate cases at New Orleans, Mississippi Valley and Arizona State.</p>
<p>The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an investigation that concluded Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short, Jamond Vincent, Donovan Sanders, Alvin Stredic and Chatton ‘BJ’ Freeman manipulated their performances to lose games, not cover betting lines, ensure certain prop bets were reached or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season.</p>
<p>In September, the NCAA also banned three college basketball players for betting on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State.</p>
<p>The violations at New Orleans against Hunter, Short and Vincent came to light after the NCAA received a tip about game manipulation. The NCAA said a student-athlete overheard the three players discuss a third party placing a bet on their game against McNeese State on 28 December 2024. New Orleans lost 86-61.</p>
<p>That same student-athlete reported that during a timeout near the end of the game, Short instructed him not to score any more points. New Orleans suspended all three student-athletes for the remainder of the season while it investigated the allegations.</p>
<p>The NCAA investigation showed that the three players manipulated their performances in seven games from December through January to lose by more points than the spread for that game.</p>
<p>The violations against Freeman were uncovered when the NCAA reviewed text messages involving Mykell Robinson, who played at Fresno State. Records on Robinson’s phone indicated that on four separate occasions between November and December 2024, Freeman knowingly provided information to Robinson, who was betting on Freeman through daily fantasy sports accounts.</p>
<p>Freeman also knowingly provided information on at least two occasions to his then-girlfriend, who was also betting on Freeman.</p>
<p>The NCAA said last month that it had been investigating at least 30 current or former players for gambling issues.</p>

<p>Darrel John watched the final evacuees depart his village on the western coast of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska">Alaska</a> in helicopters and small planes and walked home, avoiding the debris piled on the boardwalks over the swampy land.</p>

      <p>In Marana, residents crowded into a town hall recently to learn the fate of a building that’s been closed for two years</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona">Arizona</a> town where farmers have long wrested a living off the arid land, reports that a former prison complex may be turned into an immigration detention center have sparked a fierce backlash, with residents seeing the potential transition as the latest undesirable symbol of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s massive escalation of immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The facility in Marana, a town of about <a href="https://www.maranaaz.gov/Departments/Economic-Development-and-Tourism/Demographics">63,700</a> people located north of Tucson, sprawls across a flat expanse of desert studded with scrubby bushes and hardy trees. It was shuttered almost two years ago, and the Management and Training Corporation, the private company that owns it, informed the town manager of company plans to operate a detention center in the prison.</p>

<p>The era of teen news media is seemingly withering, and that’s a big deal for teens — and adults. Earlier this week, Teen Vogue’s publisher, Condé Nast, announced that it would be folding the 22-year-old brand under the Vogue.com umbrella, calling it “a transition that’s part of a broader push to expand the Vogue ecosystem.”</p>

      <p>Eduardo Flores-Ruiz pleaded guilty to illegally re-entering US and will soon be deported, his attorney says</p>
<p>An immigrant who was arrested after a judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> allegedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/judge-hannah-dugan-milwaukee-arrest">helped him dodge federal agents</a> has been sentenced to time served for illegally re-entering the United States and will soon be deported, according to his attorney.</p>
<p>Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, has spent nearly seven months in jail since he was arrested outside the Milwaukee county courthouse. He pleaded guilty in September to illegally re-entering the country after he reached a deal with prosecutors to not fight deportation. Prosecutors in exchange agreed to recommend a time-served sentence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has pardoned the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee">Tennessee</a> state house speaker and a one-time aide of public corruption charges after the White House said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a>’s justice department “significantly over-prosecuted” both for a minor issue.</p>
<p>Glen Casada, a former Republican state representative, was sentenced in September to three years in prison, and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, was also convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The case centered on their actions after both had been driven from their leadership roles and were accused of running a scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers.</p>

      <p>Starting today, the Federal Aviation Administration is requiring airlines to reduce flights at 40 airports because of the strain that air traffic controllers are under during what's turned into the longest federal government shutdown ever. Fewer flights mean reduced supply, just as demand is about to ramp up for the holidays. And there’s gonna be consequences for both airlines and consumers — including likely price increases. Plus, what constitutes a &quot;workplace emergency&quot; these days?</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Judge orders Trump administration to stop ‘needless suffering’ and fully fund food stamps</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Policy means ‘people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened’, says judge. Plus, Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Musk</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Rhode Island <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump">ordered the Trump administration</a> yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>What is the impact?</strong> After the administration said on Monday it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">only half</a> fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help">“One in eight people in our country right now</a> don’t have enough to eat.”</p>
<p><strong>What’s the shutdown latest?</strong> It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37">hold the line</a> to extract significant concessions.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> <strong>details do we know</strong> <strong>?</strong> The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>What impact could the move</strong> <strong>have?</strong> The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.</p>

      <h1>‘We’re sick of the OnlyFans model’: Stella Barey’s porn site lets gen Z sex workers have a life</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>The 28-year-old’s platform, Hidden, offers a Tumblr-like sensibility in an industry roiled by slop and lets adult content creators earn without burning out</p>
<p>Stella Barey has an hour for lunch. At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.</p>
<p>When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.</p>

<p>But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi’s announcement that, after nearly four decades in Congress, she will not seek re-election has reignited interest in the race for her long-held San Francisco seat.</p>
<p>The retirement of the former speaker of the House was long-anticipated, and two Democrats had already declared their intent to run. Saikat Chakrabarti, a former tech executive who previously served as the chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Scott Wiener, a state senator, kicked off their campaigns this year.</p>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Bob Birarda, jailed in 2022 for assaulting players, is not listed by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer. The country’s new Safe Sport director says the omission exposes a major gap — and is calling for a global registry of banned coaches.</p>
<p>Two years after receiving an 18-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting players under his care, a former Canada women’s national team coach is yet to appear on any public sanctions list published by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer, the regional governing body for soccer in British Columbia, where the crimes took place.</p>
<p>The revelation has prompted the executive director of the Canadian organization newly appointed to manage reports of abuse and misconduct to call for an international registry of offenders to track individuals who have been banned from sports for misconduct.</p>

      <h1>US supreme court allows Trump to block passport sex markers for trans and non-binary people</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Decision by high court’s conservative majority is Trump administration’s latest win on emergency docket</p>
<p>The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.</p>
<p>The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.</p>

      <h1>Trump claims his tariffs are matter of ‘national security’ after supreme court appears skeptical – live</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>President defends tariffs as nation’s ‘difference between going bankrupt and thriving’ and says court ruling against them would be ‘somewhat catastrophic’</p>
<p>It’s now day 37 of the ongoing government shutdown, the longest on record, with both parties continuing to blame the other for the lapse in funding.</p>
<p>For his part, Donald Trump has turned his attention to the filibuster – the procedural mechanism that requires 60 votes in the Senate to end debate on a piece of legislation and bring it to the floor for a vote. He’s hammered home his wishes on Truth Social, and in front of lawmakers at a White House breakfast on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The ruling by US district judge John J McConnell Jr gave the Trump administration until Friday to make the payments through Snap, though it is unlikely the people that rely on it will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries that quickly.</p>

      <p>Jessica Pegula hammered Jasmine Paolini before Aryna Sabalenka dismissed Coco Gauff, the two winners moving on to the semi-finals</p>
<p><strong>Paolini nets to go down 0-15 but soon makes 30-15, and a backhand swiped wide gives her game point.</strong> And though a decent return incites her to go wide, a decent first serve serve secures the hold. “It’s always good to get the first game under your belt,” revelates Tim Henman.</p>

<p>The longest government shutdown in history is now in its 37th day, though lawmakers, currently in talks, could be coming closer to a deal to end the standoff.</p>
<p>Some Democratic legislators, though, saw Tuesday’s big electoral wins as evidence they should hold the line and extract as much as possible from Republicans, most critically extending health insurance subsidies that, without intervention, will drastically increase costs for millions of Americans.</p>

      <p>US government shutdown blamed for cuts from Friday, two weeks before busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period</p>

</ul>
<p>New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341">government shutdown</a>, according to a list distributed to the airlines.</p>
<p>The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.</p>
<p>This article was amended on 6 November 2025. A previous version said the US government was in its 35th day of shutdown. The correct current number is 37 days.</p>

<p>Gio Reyna and Joe Scally will make their US men’s national team returns in the upcoming international window, while Christian Pulisic is among several regulars set to miss out. But while the Milan midfielder has just recovered from an injury suffered during his most recent time with the national team, Weston McKennie’s absence is a bit more surprising.</p>
<p>Reyna and Scally, both of Borussia Mönchengladbach, are among a 25-player squad named by manager Mauricio Pochettino for two friendlies: against Paraguay on 15 November at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, and against Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on 18 November.</p>

      <h1>Nancy Pelosi reflects on career as she announces retirement from Congress – video</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Nancy Pelosi, a California Democratic representative and the first woman to serve as speaker, has announced she will retire from Congress, two years after stepping down from House leadership. She made the announcement in a video that reflects on her successful political career. The decision marks the close of a 20-term congressional career in which Pelosi rose to the apex of American politics. A force on Capitol Hill for decades, she was a central figure in the major legislative accomplishments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden’s presidencies</p>

      <p>Yesterday, Supreme Court justices heard arguments and asked questions about whether an emergency powers law could be used by a president to overhaul international trade and bring in lots of money through import taxes — all without getting Congress to go along. The justices were skeptical, to say the least. We'll discuss. Plus, we'll hear how suspended SNAP benefits are playing out at one food bank in Central California.</p>

      <p>Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage</p>
<p>California voters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result">overwhelmingly approved</a> a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/02/us-redistrcting-congressional-map">all-out sprint to rejigger</a> district lines ahead of next year’s midterms.</p>
<p>California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/01/texas-republicans-congressional-redistricting-trump">passed a map</a> that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress.

      <p>Tech billionaire relying on ‘false binary’ with call to focus less on emissions and more on aid for poor, experts say</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/bill-gates-climate-crisis-pivot">new memo</a> on the climate crisis from Bill Gates relies on “straw man” arguments about the threat to humanity and “false dichotomies” between spending on climate or aid for the poor, some climate scientists say.</p>
<p>Published last week, the tech billionaire’s 17-page missive called for a “strategic pivot” away from focusing on slashing emissions and towards preventing poverty and suffering. It was quickly picked up by some on the right, including Donald Trump, who hailed it as a much-needed backpedaling on climate efforts.</p>

      <p>Democrats’ commanding victories have breathed new life for supporters of the reproductive health fight</p>
<p>Supporters of abortion rights have spent much of the last year trying to fight Donald Trump’s attempts to undermine access to the procedure. Now, Democrats’ commanding victories in the 2025 elections have breathed new life into the fight.</p>
<p>Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill’s respective gubernatorial victories in Virginia and New Jersey will shield abortion rights in two states that have become havens for people fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, voters decided to retain three liberal supreme court justices, maintaining Democratic control of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/state-supreme-court-abortion-ballot">bench that could decide the future of abortion rights</a> in the deeply purple state.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say">still a chance for the world to avoid</a> the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.</p>
<p><strong>How do things stand?</strong> For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time">1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels</a> set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.</p>
<p><strong>What has Brazil’s president said</strong> <strong>?</strong> “This [summit] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/brazil-cop-30-truth-world-leaders-climate-crisis-president-lula">wrote for the Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the case about?</strong> Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the court sides against the president?</strong> It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.</p>

<p>The US is ending temporary deportation protection for South Sudanese nationals, which for more than a decade allowed people from the east African country to stay in the US after escaping conflict.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/11/06/2025-19800/termination-of-the-designation-of-south-sudan-for-temporary-protected-status">notice</a> published on Wednesday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said conditions in South Sudan no longer met the statutory requirements for temporary protected status. The agency said South Sudanese nationals with status through the programme had 60 days to leave the US or face deportation.</p>

      <h1>How Mamdani built an ‘unstoppable force’ that won over New York</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>The mayor-elect built the greatest field operation by any political campaign in the city’s history – by getting New Yorkers to talk to eachother. Can Democrats learn from his success?</p>
<p>A week before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> astounded the world by his out-of-nowhere, odds-defying, convention-shattering victory in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City mayoral election, members of his vast army of youthful volunteers were amply aware of what was at stake.</p>

      <p>Big tech companies have <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/08/28/spending-on-ai-data-centers-could-run-to-the-trillions-of-dollars-by-the-end-of-the-decade">invested hundreds of billions</a> in AI infrastructure, including data centers that are popping up all over the country. Constructing the facilities brings in jobs to local communities, but what happens once the construction is finished? Former Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Pat Harker says tech companies owe a longer-lasting benefit to the communities that host data centers.</p>
<p>Marketplace tech host Nova Safo talked with Pat Harker about his proposal for a “digital AI land grant act.”</p>

      <h1>The job market keeps flashing warning signs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>With no government jobs data available during the shutdown, analysts have turned to private reports for clues about the labor market. In the latest round, ADP said private companies added jobs in October, despite job openings hitting their lowest level since early 2021. Experts say the labor market is stalled but stable, though risks of a downturn are growing. Also in this episode: the K-shaped economy comes for the housing market, global food systems face challenges with limited land, and Southwest cuts accommodations for larger-bodied flyers.</p>

      <h1>Trump disparages Zohran Mamdani’s victory after Democrats sweep key 2025 elections – live</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>Trump calls New York mayor-elect a ‘communist’ and says Mamdani’s victory is an example of the future direction of the Democratic party</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the pictures from New York, as Zohran Mamdani was elected the next mayor of the city.</p>
<p>In a short while, we’ll hear from <strong>Donald Trump</strong> when he hosts a breakfast with Republican senators at the White House. As we noted earlier, the president had choice words about Mamdani’s victory in New York, and other Democratic wins across the country – including the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey.</p>

      <p>Gerardo ‘Jerry’ Estrada, 30, was hit head-on by weaving car with sirens on that had drifted from correct side of street</p>
<p>The Los Angeles police department has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-04/lapd-skateboarder-fatal-crash">released disturbing dashcam footage</a> of its officers weaving in and out of traffic before fatally striking a skateboarder.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAX9mJPx6tA">video</a> of the 19 September collision shows an LAPD cruiser, with its sirens on at around 7.15pm, at times driving on the wrong side of the road to get past cars. While the driver and another officer appeared to be engaged in a casual conversation, they drifted from the correct side of the street into a center lane, at which point the skateboarder appeared in view.</p>

<p>A federal investigator said a UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly before it crashed and exploded into a huge fireball in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday night, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.</p>
<p>At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents arrived at the site and began searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/louisville-plane-crash-airport-kentucky-latest">crash shortly after takeoff</a> at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.</p>

      <h1>Trump voters for Mamdani and a new left coalition: the biggest surprises from New York’s election</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>Political analyst Michael Lange, a born and raised New Yorker who predicted Zohran Mamdani would win, discusses election night’s trends and surprises</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-new-york-nyc-donald-trump-mayor-election-california-new-jersey-virginia-latest-news-results">US politics live – latest updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Two days before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> mayoral election, Michael Lange made a <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-177872464">big electoral prediction</a> – not just of who would win overall, or in each borough or neighborhood, but block by block. Lange, a political analyst born and raised in New York City, has spent over a decade in progressive politics and has become something of a local celebrity this year for his deep dives into city data and polling.</p>
<p>He published his highly detailed prediction map – which correctly forecast that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> would win although failed to predict <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>’s strong performance – on his Substack, <a href="https://www.michaellange.nyc/">the Narrative War</a>. Lange has a flair for witty coinages. He highlighted, for instance, the divide between the “commie corridor”, stretching from Park Slope to Bushwick to Astoria, where he predicted (accurately) that Mamdani would win by huge margins, and the “capitalist corridor” on Manhattan’s Upper East and Upper West Sides. There, “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2025/sep/10/bari-weiss-cbs">Free Press</a> and Wall Street Journal outrank the New York Times” in readership and most voters leaned toward Cuomo, who ran as a conservative-courting independent.</p>

<p><strong>*Alexandrova 3-2 Rybakina (* denotes server):</strong> Rybakina attacks Alexandrova’s second serve, coming inside to hit a deep forehand return that makes it 15-30. The former steps into a backhand winner to make it 30-40, but Alexandrova resists, closing the game with an ace.</p>

<p>The suit, filed by David Tangipa, a Republican assembly member, 18 California voters and the state Republican party in the US district court for the central district of California, argues that the new maps are unconstitutional because they were drawn to increase the voting power of a particular racial group. It asks the court to block the new maps from taking effect, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>Indigenous leaders are concerned after this year’s federal budget left key reconciliation programs without guaranteed money beyond spring 2026.

      <p>From military-level force in cities to tens of thousands of federal workers fired by the Trump administration, effects have been felt at every level</p>
<p>Last year, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> campaign promises and policy proposals became increasingly clear, the Guardian published a series called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-stakes">The Stakes</a> to outline the impact the administration would likely have on the country. The stories were broken down by subject matter – spanning civil rights, health, immigration and cities.</p>
<p>Much of what was covered in the series has played out on American streets and inside homes since Trump was inaugurated in January. From military-level force used in urban centers, to tens of thousands of federal workers fired by the administration, the effects have been felt at every level.</p>

      <h1>New York parties for Zohran Mamdani: ‘The first time we’ve had hope in so long’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>In the bodegas, bars and clubs of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, the mood was joyous – it was an emotional night</p>
<p>Inside an election watch party hosted by the Democratic Socialists of America at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple in Fort Greene, under the din of pet-nat wines being cracked open, there was a sense of nervous anticipation. “I’m not sure if this is an accurate recreation of Solomon’s Temple,” said one supporter in a Zohran Mamdani T-shirt. “This is like a who’s who of everyone I’ve slept with,” said another.</p>
<p>The suspense didn’t last long. Just after 9.30pm, someone jumped on the mic to announce that news outlets had called it: a record number of New Yorkers had cast ballots in this electric – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/zohran-mamdani-attacks-racism-islamophobia-">often ugly</a> – race between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">ultimately choosing</a> the 34-year-old democratic socialist of seemingly boundless energy who had shocked party establishment in the primary by winning on a clear-eyed affordability agenda. The DJ immediately started playing I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas. And, indeed, tonight was a good, good night for those in the room, who erupted in tears, hugs and twerking.</p>

      <p>Federal judge concerned that justice department sought to ‘indict first and investigate later’ in case of ex-FBI director</p>
<p>A federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the criminal case of the former FBI director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey">James Comey</a> to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, saying he was concerned that the justice department’s position had been to “indict first and investigate later”.</p>
<p>Magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of the day on Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized during the investigation. The order followed arguments in which Comey’s attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago.</p>

      <h1>The rise of the private asset</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>The London Stock Exchange has launched a series of indexes to track private investment funds. &quot;Private investment&quot; is a phrase we've been hearing a lot — the Trump administration is trying to make it easier to add it to your 401(k). And the &quot;private credit&quot; market has been catching serious side-eye from Jamie Dimon and others. But what the heck does &quot;private&quot; even mean in these contexts? We have an explainer. Plus, a look at job creation and sentiment among farmers.</p>

      <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments today on whether President Donald Trump can use emergency powers to levy tariffs. The law in question doesn’t mention tariffs, but the president also has wide latitude in setting the foreign-policy agenda. Let's dig into both sides' arguments. Plus, China's government is hosting a big trade show, and auto sales fall into a pot hole with EV subsidies gone.</p>

      <p>New York traded away two of their best players in an extraordinary few hours. But they could finally have made a decision that makes sense</p>
<p>It’s rare to see a franchise accept what everyone else already knows – that what they’ve built isn’t working. The Jets didn’t just tweak their roster at the deadline; they detonated it. In a dizzying few hours, they dealt cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Shein is making headlines for more than its new brick-and-mortar store in Paris’s famed BHV department store. But the launch has been overshadowed by French authorities’ investigation into disturbing, illegal products sold on the platform, as well as on Temu, AliExpress, and Wish. Today, we'll learn more. And some people in Thailand are relying on informal money lenders to cover the bills as consumer debt levels soar. We'll examine the deeper costs.</p>

<p>The Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">elected as the 111th mayor of New York City</a>, defeating the former governor Andrew Cuomo and the Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.</p>
<p><strong>How did the New York vote go?</strong> Mamdani received more votes than all the other candidates combined. With 97% of votes counted, he was on 50.4% of the total, while Cuomo was on 41.6% and Sliwa on 7.1%.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for the city?</strong> Mamdani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/wednesday-briefing-improbable-victory-for-citys-first-muslim-mayor-offers-new-playbook-for-fight-against-trump">wants to</a> freeze rent for 2 million people, to raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour, increase taxes on the highest earners, make bus transit free, offer universal childcare and increase affordable housing provision, among other things. The question now is how much of that platform he can deliver.</p>

<p>The government shutdown has entered its 36th day, setting the record as the longest ever, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans with federal program cuts, missed paychecks, flight delays while costing the U.S. at least $10 billion per week, according to estimates.</p>

Among the attenders is <strong>Suzanne Miller,</strong> a realtor who volunteered for the Cuomo campaign. She said she is “50-50” about his chances of winning. Miller said she was nervous because of Zohran Mamdani’s energetic closing few days of the campaign.</p>

<p>US government investigations into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-universities">universities</a> over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/antisemitism">antisemitism</a> allegations surged following the 7 October 2023 attacks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>’s subsequent war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, with more investigations open in the last two months of that year than in the two decades prior, according to a report published on Monday that was shared exclusively with the Guardian.</p>
<p>The data, compiled by the Middle East Studies Association and the American Association of University Professors and relying on publicly available records, offers a detailed account of how landmark civil rights legislation – and particularly Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act – has become a primary tool to restrict speech on campus.</p>

Jetha says the new tech bro is of the “hard tech” era, with emphasis on the charisma needed to raise huge sums of money for expensive hardware innovations and AI technologies.</p>

For months, markets have ignored elevated interest rates, stubborn inflation, trade turmoil and a patchy global economy, leading some to worry about whether hopes surrounding AI were creating a bubble that could burst.</p>

      <p>A broken wrist and time away from the sport helped Kate Courtney find new purpose – and the freedom that led to another world title</p>
<p>In early September, Kate Courtney lined up at the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships for the 12th time in her career, but the first time targeting the marathon distance. A figure at the front of the pack in the shorter cross country and short track distances, Courtney would surprise everyone by winning the 77-mile race, claiming the second rainbow jersey of her nearly decade-long career.</p>
<p>“The competition at the sharp end is so high and the course was brutal, so I was productively intimidated,” said the 30-year-old Courtney, “I didn’t think much about the pressure of winning, which let me just focus on myself.”</p>

      <p>Zohran Mamdani supporters said they were 'elated' and 'hopeful' after the Democratic candidate was elected as the new mayor of New York City. Mamdani's socialist campaign promising to freeze rent and make buses free seduced New Yorkers who voted for him en masse, securing victory for him with more than 50% of the vote. He will be inaugurated as the 111th mayor of the city in January</p>

      <p>In today’s newsletter: With more than 50% of the vote, Mamdani tells supporters: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light”</p>
<p>Good morning. A few hours ago, Zohran Mamdani was declared <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">the winner of the New York City mayoral election</a> with more than 50% of the vote on the biggest turnout since the 1960s. A rank outsider when the race started, he will become the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. And as an avowed socialist who has emerged as a national symbol of opposition to Donald Trump, he has given progressive Democrats something they believe is worth fighting for.</p>
<p>It was a good night all over for Democrats, who won governorships <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger">in Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/new-jersey-election-result-mikie-sherrill-wins-governor-race">New Jersey</a> and saw voters in California support <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result">a redistricting plan</a> designed to counter Republican efforts to redraw the map to their advantage in red states. But Republicans believe Mamdani is a gift for them, too: in frequently racist attacks on his candidacy, they have tarred him as a “Jihadist”, a communist and claimed he represents a new extremity on the left.</p>

      <h1>US Senate rejects funding package for 14th time with shutdown in 35th day</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>But talks between factions are under way as Democrats and Republicans try to bring standoff to a close</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">US federal government shutdown</a> was poised to move into record-breaking territory on Tuesday after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> rejected for the 14th time a funding package already passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<p>With the shutdown now in its record-equalling 35th day, frantic behind-the-scenes talks were under way to bring the standoff to a close amid expressions of alarm from Democrats and Republicans alike about its disruptive effects on millions of Americans.</p>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Jamie Raskin in a letter questioned why justice department abruptly ended investigation into Epstein co-conspirators</p>
<p>A top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrat</a> has demanded to know why the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> “inexplicably killed” a criminal investigation into the late convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s alleged co-conspirators as he accused the justice department of a “shameful and gigantic cover-up”.</p>
<p>Jamie Raskin, a House judiciary committee ranking member and congressman from Maryland, claimed the decision to end the investigation in July had shielded an alleged network of “powerful individuals accused of enabling and engaging in the massive billion-dollar sex trafficking operation” while ignoring the accounts of women exploited by Epstein.</p>

<p>Weeks before one of America’s best-known businessmen, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, was sworn in as president on an overcast day in Washington DC, a different politician with a similarly familiar name took her oath of office elsewhere in the Capitol.</p>
<p>Liz Cheney was then both a freshman congresswoman from Wyoming and a stalwart of the neoconservative philosophy espoused by her father Dick Cheney, the former vice-president under George W Bush who died on Monday. Trump had repudiated Bush’s invasion of Iraq in his campaign for president, but the congresswoman nonetheless went on to become an ally in bending Republican lawmakers to his will.</p>

<p>Dick Cheney, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies">who has died aged 84</a>, came to be seen as a moderate in his later years for his staunch opposition to Donald Trump, but he also stands accused of paving the way for Trumpism by undermining the independence of the intelligence agencies and US adherence to international law.</p>
<p>As George W Bush’s second-in-command in the “war on terror” declared after the 9/11 attacks, Cheney made himself one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, and was a key protagonist in the push to invade Iraq, as well as the use of torture on suspected al-Qaida members detained without charge in the CIA’s offshore “black sites”.</p>

      <h1>WTA Finals tennis: Sabalenka fends off Pegula; Gauff beats ailing Paolini – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Aryna Sabalenka dug deep to beat Jessica Pegula 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 while Coco Gauff cleaned up her service game to win 6-3, 6-2 against Jasmine Paolini</p>
<p><strong>Gauff 3-1 Paolini* (* denotes server):</strong> Gauff nets two backhands in a row as the Italian plays her first ball with a bit more power than in the first three games. But Guaff uses the court to make Paolini chase the ball at the baseline and gets to deuce after a weak second serve from the Italian. The two trade advantages for a while and at the fifth deuce, Gauff nets a backhand return. Paolini finally sees out the 8min 58sec game after Gauff sends one long.</p>
<p><strong>*Gauff 3-0 Paolini (* denotes server):</strong> A long rally ends with the Italian powerfully slicing a winner and following it up with another crosscourt forehand that Gauff strains to reach. But she sends three returns long in back-to-back break points, putting her arms up in the air in frustration. Gauff gets the advantage and turns the game around to take the set after another poor return from Paolini, this one going into the stands.</p>

      <p>Ballot measure would let legislature redraw congressional districts to carve out five more Democratic seats</p>
<p>Californians headed to the polls on Tuesday to decide on Proposition 50, a ballot measure of national significance that could play a major role in determining which party controls the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House of Representatives</a> after the 2026 midterms.</p>
<p>If voters approve the proposal, the state will halt the work of its independent redistricting commission and allow the legislature to redraw congressional districts to carve out five additional Democratic congressional seats. The effort is a direct attempt to neutralize <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a>’s partisan gerrymander, undertaken at the request of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, to create several new safe Republican districts.</p>

Kennedy wants to link to autism, despite a lack of scientific evidence. People are now suing Kenvue, a potential liability that will become Kimberly-Clark's problem. We unpack. Also: potential changes to public service loan forgiveness and a speech by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> artist’s efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.</p>

<p>Bush wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/MikeEmanuelFox/status/1985703848648876450">statement</a> that he would remember Cheney “for the decent honorable man that he was” and that history would remember him “as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held”.</p>

      <h1>Judge considers Democratic challenge to Trump troop deployment in Memphis</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>City government declines to raise objection in court but state leaders and ACLU seek to block deployment of troops</p>
<p>A state court in Nashville on Monday heard a legal challenge by some Democratic elected officials to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s deployment of the national guard into the streets of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/memphis">Memphis</a>, notable in part because of who has not raised an objection: the city of Memphis itself.</p>
<p>Shelby county’s mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats. Other state and local leaders joined the suit, including one Memphis city council member. The ACLU later filed briefs in support of the suit seeking an injunction to block the deployment of troops.</p>

      <h1>Could a win on California’s Prop 50 aid Gavin Newsom’s presidential hopes?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>The ballot measure win would be a significant political gain for the Golden state governor eyeing the White House</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom, the California governor, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/california-prop-50-democrats-trump">on the verge</a> of a political victory that, just a few months ago, didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In August, a group of Texas Democrats fled their state to block Republicans from approving a rare mid-decade gerrymander to redraw congressional districts at Donald Trump’s urging. Altering the maps in the GOP’s favor would make it even harder for Democrats to take back control of Congress in the midterm elections next year. The Texas Democrats hoped their standoff would be a national call to action.</p>

<p>Emily Fox made her 68th appearance for the United States in the first of two recent friendlies against Portugal and the Arsenal right-back has been a steady hand for Emma Hayes.</p>
<p>Hayes has her eye on the 2027 World Cup after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/10/usa-brazil-olympic-womens-football-final-result-emma-hayes">winning Olympic gold</a> 15 months ago, and has used 2025 to evolve and evaluate the pool of players. Over the course of 10 wins and three defeats in that timeframe, Fox has been a dynamic force difficult to dislodge from the right flank of a new project. Her speed and skill are essential to the team’s defence and intrinsic to their attack.</p>

Whichever way the high court decides, however, the co-founder of True Places, a Pennsylvania-based folding camp chair company, thinks that likely won't be the end of the tariff rollercoaster. Plus, Norway's massive sovereign wealth fund has voted against Elon Musk’s pay package from Tesla. Why?</p>

<p>Countries have submitted their most recent round of promises and plans to fight climate change, and the UN has tallied them up in a new report. Here is its latest projection for how much the Earth is now expected to warm by the end of the century, and how Canada and the U.S. are contributing.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s intense pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge key foes with crimes based on dubious evidence and his ongoing investigations of other political enemies is hurting the rule of law in the US and violating departmental policies, which scholars and ex-prosecutors say may help scuttle some charges.</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">suspending</a> Snap altogether.</p>
<p><strong>What impact will it have?</strong> There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions">spoke to people</a> affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.</p>
<p><strong>Can Trump even do that?</strong> The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo">legal contention</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What do New York polls say?</strong> A recent survey from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html">AtlasIntel</a> showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.</p>

While they may not be as blunt as the law Trump has cited, there are a handful of other laws the president can cite to utilize tariffs for leverage and revenue.</p>

      <h1>The trouble with US veterans benefits isn’t ‘rampant’ fraud – it’s bureaucratic roadblocks, advocates say</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting</p>
<p>In October, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post">Washington Post</a> reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.</p>
<p>“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/">reported</a>.</p>

      <h1>Democrats fight to rebuild in key state races on election day</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>With polls showing signs of recovery after a popularity slump, Tuesday’s results will test whether the party can regain voters’ trust</p>
<p>One year after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.</p>
<p>With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.</p>

      <h1>Andrew Wiggins: how a shy NBA player negotiated growing up a star in the social media era</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>In an extract from his new book on the rise of Canadian basketball, Oren Weisfeld examines the pressures of being a teenage star in the modern game</p>
<p>Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.</p>
<p>After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.</p>
<p><em>This is an edited extract from The Golden Generation: How Canada Became a Basketball Powerhouse by Oren Weisfeld. It’s published by ECW Press for $19.95 (USD) wherever you get your books.</em></p>

<p>Dallas fall to 3-5-1 as Arizona move to 3-5 with win</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacoby Brissett had a stock answer ready for the question of whether the Arizona quarterback has done enough to be the replacement, not just the fill-in, for Kyler Murray. The coach, Jonathan Gannon, barely had an answer at all. The Cardinals will worry about what appears to be a full-blown controversy later. For now, they will enjoy ending a five-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Brissett threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score in another game with Murray sidelined by a foot injury, and the Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys 27-17 on Monday night. Brissett made his third consecutive start after the week began with expectations of Murray returning coming off the team’s open week.</p>

<p>As a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to, for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history, cut off benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (Snap). A federal judge last week prevented the US Department of Agriculture from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">suspending Snap altogether</a>, but the Trump administration now says enrollees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">will receive only half</a> of their usual benefits.</p>

      <h1>How long until SNAP reaches kitchen tables?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been court ordered to partially fund this month’s SNAP benefits, after refusing to step in during the shutdown. Emergency USDA funds will cover about half of the $8 billion spent each month on the food assistance program. But it’s unclear how long households could wait for the partial benefits to kick in.

<p>Looking ahead, on Wednesday, <strong>the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.</strong> It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.</p>
<p>My colleague, <strong>Eduardo Porter</strong>, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.</p>
<p>Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf">levy a tariff</a> – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.</p>
<p>IEEPA <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701">gives the president</a> authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A video that went viral captured Sean Charles Dunn hurling his sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside a nightclub</p>
<p>Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> law-enforcement surge in the nation’s capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington DC residents that Dunn simply broke the law.</p>
<p>That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Trump’s federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before the office of Jeanine Pirro, a US attorney, opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.</p>

But, with temperatures in Alaska warming nearly four times faster than most parts of the globe, that way of life is about to change.</p>
<p>Homes in Nunapitchuk have been sinking into the <a href="https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/frozen-ground-permafrost">permafrost</a>, and residents have decided their only choice is to move the entire village to higher ground.</p>

      <h1>Are Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs legal or not?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>That's the question before the Supreme Court this week. President Donald Trump has been declaring an emergency and then using emergency authority to impose many of these tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is among those who've said they expect to prevail in the high court, but if they don't, there are other ways to apply taxes on goods from other countries. Also: BP shale asset sales and a dark side of the drug rehab industry.</p>

      <p>Platner’s populist campaign faces backlash over past comments and a contentious tattoo</p>
<p>On a recent Monday night, Graham Platner – oysterman, army veteran and Democratic hopeful for US Senate – took the stage in a small <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> town known for its oyster farming to assure voters that he was still in the game to win the Democratic primary, and ultimately unseat five-term Republican incumbent Susan Collins.</p>
<p>He addressed a crowd of 700, the most that could fit into the school gymnasium in Damariscotta, Maine before organizers had to start turning people away. As is typical for his campaign events, the gruff, plain-talking, flannel-clad, local business owner and former marine dissected the “establishment political system that serves the interests of the ultra wealthy” in front of a captivated audience.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This past weekend, as the shutdown stretches on, funds for SNAP benefits began to dry up. The Treasury Secretary says payments could restart this week, and a federal court said the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds to get this done. Today, we'll check in with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance for a snapshot of food insecurity there. Plus, Trump says he wants to fix Obamacare, and U.S. auto production could be hampered by a looming chip shortage.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Top 10 US billionaires’ wealth grew by $698bn in past year</h1>

      <p>Oxfam says Trump policies risk driving inequality to new heights while noting Democrats have also exacerbated wealth gap. Plus, why Salman Rushdie’s therapist has called him a ‘badass’</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The collective wealth of the top 10 US billionaires has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/wealth-billionaires-increase-trump">soared by $698bn in the past year</a>, according to a report from Oxfam America on the growing wealth divide.</p>
<p><strong>How have Trump’s policies affected the figures?</strong> Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in May, has been one of the “single largest transfers of wealth upwards in decades”, according to the report, by cutting tax for the wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The system, which launched more than a year ago, rewards soldiers who achieve strikes with points that can be exchanged to buy more weapons in an “Amazon-for-war” online store called Brave1 filled with more than 100 different drones, autonomous vehicles and other drone war material.</p>

      <p>The president’s wife is reported to have ‘privately raised concerns about’ the destruction of the White House East Wing. If so, they were ignored</p>
<p>From Eleanor Roosevelt to Melania Trump, the East Wing of the White House served as a base for first ladies. It was where Michelle Obama <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/photos-and-video/photo/2013/03/first-lady-michelle-obama-participates-let-s-move-twitter-office-hour">spearheaded</a> her <a href="https://readingpartners.org/blog/michelle-obama-gets-kids-moving-reading-east-wing/">Let’s Move</a> public health campaign and where Nancy Reagan and her staff worked on the Just Say No drug awareness initiative.</p>
<p>“It was a place where first ladies could carry out the important work that they do,” said Katherine AS Sibley, a professor of history at St Joseph’s University.</p>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is serving 25 years in federal prison for fraud. His company collapsed and went bankrupt in 2022. Investigators found that billions of dollars in customer funds had been borrowed without permission to help shore up Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.</p>
<p>But throughout the last three years, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence, and he's filed an appeal. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Jonathan Jones, a reporter and producer for the investigative podcast “Reveal,” who spent hours talking to the former CEO, FTX insiders and customers.</p>

      <h1>At the World Series the Blue Jays belonged to Canada – and large parts of the US too</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>One baseball win was never going to bind Canada – and sympathetic fans south of the border – together for ever. But it was sweet while it lasted</p>
<p>The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.</p>
<p>This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball">a heartbreaking Game 7</a>, missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.</p>

      <h1>The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad game</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Buffalo extended their regular season domination over Kansas City. But they know that the playoffs are another matter altogether</p>
<p>Of course Josh Allen didn’t take a breath in the final seconds of the latest Chiefs-Bills classic. “You never know with Pat [Mahomes],” Allen told reporters after Buffalo eked out a 28-21 win on Sunday. Bills kicker Matt Prater had earlier missed a 52-yard field goal with 27 seconds remaining that would have sealed the win for Buffalo. Even the miss was dramatic, with Prater doinking his kick off the right upright. Allen wasn’t alone in thinking Mahomes could lead the Chiefs 58 yards down the field with 22 seconds left and no time outs. One Chiefs fan in Buffalo certainly <a href="https://x.com/TrainwreckSprts/status/1985030484615721042">reminded the home crowd</a> of Buffalo’s 2021 divisional round collapse in which Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill and then Travis Kelce with 13 seconds remaining to set up a game-tying field goal and eventual overtime win.</p>
<p>Are these two teams capable of a producing a boring contest when they meet? Sunday had looked like it would go down that route, given the statement made by Buffalo’s defense, before the Chiefs threatened a comeback in the fourth quarter. The Bills had responded to questions about their depleted defense by stymying Mahomes for most of the game. This <a href="https://x.com/NFL/status/1985126243839488080">sandwich sack</a> by Greg Rousseau and Michael Hoecht showed the tenacity of Buffalo’s defensive line. They needed it: Mahomes converted on fourth and 17 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, a reminder that no matter the situation, he is always capable of tormenting the Bills.</p>

      <h1>Talking Horses | Willie Mullins eyes Melbourne and Breeders’ Cup double after shock triumph</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>The dominant jumps racing trainer has another huge Flat prize in sight after Ethical Diamond’s sparkling success</p>
<p>If five wins from the seven turf events, one short of the record, felt like a standard return for European runners at the 2025 Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar, then the identity of the biggest winner of all was a huge, and very refreshing, surprise.</p>
<p>Willie Mullins blew into Del Mar with Ethical Diamond, his first ever runner at the meeting, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/01/breeders-cup-2025-day-two-live">left with the $2m first prize in the Turf</a>, nearly five times as much as he banked when Nick Rockett landed the Grand National in April. And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/ethical-diamond-shines-bright-to-hand-william-buick-a-first-success-in-the-ebor">Ebor Handicap winner</a> leave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.</p>

<p>George Clooney has said he feels it was a “mistake” for Kamala Harris to replace Joe Biden in the 2024 US presidential election, adding that he had no regrets about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">New York Times opinion piece</a> in which he called on the Democrats to find a new presidential nominee.</p>

Instead, Harris was nominated by a virtual vote of party delegates.</p>

      <p>Despite Illinois governor’s plea to let families celebrate Halloween and Día de los Muertos, agents used pepper spray and continued to arrest people</p>
<p>For 40-year-old Cecilia Romero, the days before and after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween">Halloween</a> are not just any other holiday. It’s the time of year when she can take her kids trick-or-treating in the neighborhood she’s from – and a connection to her own past when she would go celebrate as a little girl.</p>
<p>She remembers years of streets brimming with families and children, with street vendors selling food and cempasúchil, the marigolds that loved ones place on altars for Day of the Dead – or Día de los Muertos – from 1 to 2 November.</p>

      <h1>John F Kennedy grandson says Julia Fox’s bloody Jackie Halloween costume ‘disgusting’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>Jack Schlossberg says ‘dangerous’ to evoke grandfather’s assassination; Fox says it’s a ‘statement’ of Jackie’s ‘bravery’</p>
<p>Political writer and commentator Jack Schlossberg has said it was “disgusting, desperate and dangerous” for actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/julia-fox">Julia Fox</a> to wear a Halloween costume evoking the assassination of president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy">John F Kennedy</a>, his grandfather.</p>
<p>Fox, however, has defended her controversial decision to wear a replica of the blood-stained, pink suit that former first lady Jackie Kennedy was seen wearing when her husband was shot dead by a sniper while the couple rode in a motorcade in Dallas in 1963. The Uncut Gems star has said she dressed as Jackie Kennedy as “a statement” about the poise and “extraordinary bravery” she showed when subjected to unimaginable “brutality”.</p>

But when Texas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/texas-democrats-california-electoral-maps-redistricting">moved ahead</a> with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat.</p>
<p>Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state’s governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>, who have cast it as a chance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/california-prop-50-trump-redistricting">to check Trump’s power</a>.</p>

<p>The Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, <a href="https://abigailspanberger.com/">Abigail Spanberger</a>, pitched her closing argument on Saturday to more than 7,000 supporters at a campaign rally in Norfolk, home to the world’s biggest naval base.</p>

      <h1>If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>The repeat champions’ vast wealth means they can stockpile talent unimaginable to other teams. But it’s undeniable that the results are hugely entertaining</p>
<p>A unicorn led off the game with a single and then trotted out to the mound to pitch the bottom of the first. Another pitcher won Games 2, 6, and 7 of the World Series, throwing 17.2 innings along the way. A catcher set a record, squatting behind the plate for 74 Fall Classic frames and ultimately ended the series by hitting the final go-ahead home run.</p>
<p>Just as everyone feared or sneered, the Los Angeles Dodgers are champions. Again. In what some forecasted as a harbinger of doom, the sinister strategy of employing the best baseball player on the planet along with a generous number of his nearly equal peers proved effective. <em>It’s not fair,</em> some people will say in the coming months about the fact that the team broadly believed to be the best ultimately won it all.</p>

Will Smith then hit the winning home run in the 11th inning off Shane Bieber, the first time the Dodgers had led all night.</p>

<p>Donald Trump thrives on emergencies. He cried havoc on the very first day of his second term, declaring a national emergency caused by an “invasion” of “ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/">illegal aliens</a>” from Mexico. He has since invoked emergencies more than any president since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, he faces another of his own making, as the US supreme court hears oral arguments on whether his globe-shaking signature economic policy – tariffs – is legally valid.</p>

      <h1>America’s redistricting fight: how could the US congressional map shift?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Republicans hold a 219-213 majority in the House, but they could lock in more seats if reapportionments go their way</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats have entered a war in legislatures and courts to narrow the political battlefield of 2026 before a single vote is cast.</p>
<p>Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.</p>

      <p>Schmoozing the super-rich to fund a $300m ballroom while cutting food aid for those on low incomes threw the president’s architectural folly into sharp relief</p>
<p>It was a feast fit for a king – and any billionaire willing to be his subject. From gold-rimmed plates on gold-patterned tablecloths decorated with gold candlestick holders, they gorged on heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice-cream.</p>
<p>On 15 October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom-9c5f582e5c0fbde2bee67f86b22898c5">for a dinner at the White House</a> to reward them for their pledged contributions to a vast new ballroom now expected to cost $300m.

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning</strong></p>
<p>A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.</p>
<p>George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.</p>
<p>Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.</p>
<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.</p>
<p>Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.</p>
<p>Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.</p>
<p>Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.</p>
<p>Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won their second consecutive title in stunning fashion in the early hours of Sunday morning, depriving the Toronto Blue Jays of a first World Series in 32 years in a stomach-churning, epic Game 7. Will Smith’s solo home run with two outs at the top of the 11th inning off Shane Bieber gave LA a 5-4 lead before Yoshinobu Yamamoto, pitching in relief just a day after throwing 96 pitches, got Alejandro Kirk to ground out into a World Series-ending double play, bringing a ninth title to the Dodgers organization.</p>
<p>“Man, they’re a special group of guys,” Smith said after the game. “We just never gave up, kept fighting, pitching our asses off, hitting, taking great at-bats. Finally punched through there. Man, that was a fight for seven games. That’s a really good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> team. I’m just excited. There’s nothing better than this.”</p>

(date: 2025-11-01)
      <p>
      <p>The political differences between the two main candidates could have major implications for next year’s midterms</p>
<p>New Yorkers will find out the identity of their next mayor on Tuesday, in a race that will decide who will run, and defend, the US’s largest city at a time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has threatened to send military troops there.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, New York has seen a mayoral election that has pitted two very different Democrats against one another. The race has become an increasingly bitter face-off, laced with alleged racism and Islamophobia, but it is the political differences between the two main candidates that could have major implications for how the Democratic party performs in next year’s midterm elections.</p>

      <p>Food insecurity for millions of Americans set to increase with Trump officials saying Snap benefits will cease as government shutdown enters second month</p>
<p>Waves of hungry Angelenos gathered outside Community Space food bank’s storefront on a recent afternoon, grabbing dry goods like pastries, bagels, lentils and pasta along with refrigerated salads and frozen bags of brisket.</p>
<p>The crowd ebbs and flows all day, said founder Gaines Newborn, but as news spread last week that the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) would cease on Saturday, he braced for the need to dramatically increase.</p>

<p>Egg freezing is seen by some as a way for women to take control of their fertility. Other experts, though, fear that the fertility industry is just profiting off the tension women feel between career and family building.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stayed alive on Friday night, getting to Toronto Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman for three runs in the third inning to win 3-1 and even the World Series at three games apiece. Baseball fans around the world will be treated to a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday, with the Dodgers looking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since 2000. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, will try to play spoiler and complete the upset to win their first World Series since 1993.</p>
<p>After the Dodgers offense struggled in the first four games of the series, slashing just <a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/news/dodgers-offense-questions-world-series-game-6">.201/.296/.354</a> as a team, manager Dave Roberts shuffled his lineup ahead of Game 5. But it failed, as the Dodgers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/blue-jays-yesavage-dodgers-game-5-report-world-series">managed just four hits</a> and one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.</p>

      <h1>How the economy went "K-shaped"</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. economy is increasingly “K-shaped.” That means the gap between the wealthiest companies and consumers, and ... everyone else, is growing. Big Tech companies rake it in while smaller firms struggle. Similarly, the economy is increasingly dependent on the wealthiest consumers as everyone else pinches pennies. Economists warn these imbalances make the economy more fragile. Also in this episode: Farmers experiment with agrivoltaics, a Chicago tour guide showcases the city’s architectural history, and we recap the week's economic headlines.</p>

That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”</p>

<p>John Kennedy, the Republican senator from Louisiana, had hoped to block the proposal by bringing the matter to a vote with a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act. The effort failed with 25 votes to 72 votes.</p>

      <h1>UK newspaper editor calls Bill de Blasio fake interview blunder ‘humiliating’</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>A Times associate editor reportedly addressed situation in an email to staff, saying: ‘We should have been on our guard’</p>
<p>It was “humiliating” for a Times reporter to have quoted someone the journalist erroneously believed was former New York City mayor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bill-de-blasio">Bill de Blasio</a>, an editor for the London outlet reportedly said in an email to staff.</p>
<p>“We should have been on our guard. We should have tried much harder to speak to the people concerned,” Ian Brunskill , the Times associate editor, told the company, according to an email obtained by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/bill-de-blasio-fake-interview-humiliating-times-editor-says-1236603178/">Deadline</a>. He went on to acknowledge the “serious damage” done to the Rupert Murdoch-owned paper.</p>

      <h1>Democratic representative urges former prince Andrew to testify over Epstein</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>Ro Khanna, member of the House oversight panel, said Mountbatten Windsor should provide information</p>
<p>A Democratic congressman on Friday called for the former prince Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to testify before the US House of Representatives committee that is conducting an inquiry into the government’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>
<p>The statement from Ro Khanna, a California Democratic representative, who serves on the investigative House oversight committee, comes after the UK trade minister, Chris Bryant, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/31/ex-prince-andrew-should-answer-us-questions-on-epstein-if-asked-uk-minister-says">suggested</a> that since Mountbatten Windsor had been stripped of his royal titles, he should answer demands for information about his dealings with Epstein, an alleged sex trafficker who died by suicide while in federal custody six years ago.</p>

<p>The Post reported on Friday that it collected and analyzed ticket sales data from 3 September to 19 October and found that about 43% of tickets for typical productions remained unsold. In comparison, the Post reported that about 93% of tickets were sold or issued on a complimentary basis in the fall of 2024 and 80% in the fall of 2023.</p>

      <p>Bhuwan Pyakurel and Kamal Subedi’s story charts a Bhutanese refugee community’s rise – and its growing political divide</p>
<p>Almost 32 years ago, in a refugee camp in eastern Nepal, children sat cross-legged around a small blackboard propped on the dirt, repeating the alphabet in sing-song rhythm. Among them was Bhuwan Pyakurel, a fourth-grader, and his teacher, Kamal Subedi, barely 18.</p>
<p>“He was tall, thin, and very talkative,” Subedi said, now 52. “We didn’t know what would happen tomorrow. So we went hut to hut, gathering kids to learn.” In the early 1990s, <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/prm/policyissues/issues/protracted/countries/157400.htm">thousands of Bhutanese refugees had arrived across seven</a> camps in the region, each day bringing more families, more children, and more uncertainty.</p>

      <h1>‘He’s a true legend’: what now for Frankie Dettori as racing’s biggest name leaves the stage?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The last person who transcends the sport could make more headlines at the Breeders’ Cup</p>
<p>It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.</p>
<p>Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does. In a world that has been fragmented by social media and the internet, Dettori may well be the last racing figure who will ever enjoy such instant name-recognition across a broad swathe of the British population.</p>

      <p>At least two people died on Thursday in flooded basements after record rainfall in parts of New York City that also deluged some streets and subway stations. Preliminary reports showed 45.7mm (1.8in) of rain fell in Central Park, which exceeded its record of 41.7mm set in 1917, the National Weather Service said. LaGuardia airport recorded 50mm of rain, which broke the hub's 1955 record of 30mm</p>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>Deeming universities too leftwing, outside donors and state governments are sponsoring curricula that center the classics, Christianity and the ‘great books’ of western civilization</p>
<p>A small conservative revolution has swept the humanities at some US colleges and universities. Its vanguard are new programs, called centers or institutes, that have begun cropping up at schools in recent years. Often funded by outside donors or earmarks from state governments, the programs tend to bear names featuring words such as “civic”, “freedom” or “classical”.</p>
<p>These centers do credible teaching and research, and are usually not explicitly political. But their goal, to counter what conservatives see as hegemonically leftwing teaching, arguably is.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans">restrict the number of refugees</a> it admits into the US next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.</p>
<p><strong>What reason has been given for prioritizing white South Africans?</strong> The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law. The South African government has called the claims false.</p>
<p><strong>What was the other shooting by ICE agents in LA recently?</strong> Last week, federal agents shot an LA man who livestreams immigration enforcement operations on social media. Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following, had attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car.</p>

<p>The historic shifts in US immigration under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> have been dictated by a relentless voice over a telephone line: Stephen Miller, the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> czar, who in recent months has turned the state department’s visa and refugee operations into what some current and former diplomats have described as a personal fiefdom.</p>
<p>Each morning, usually at 10am, a small circle of conservative diplomats allied with Miller, including those who have assumed control of the state department’s consular and refugee operations, dial in for what some have termed the “Stephen Miller call”, an interagency discussion of immigration measures led by Miller, the White House’s homeland security adviser.</p>

<p>It's a treat to have the Toronto Blue Jays in a position to win the World Series; the trick for many families and baseball fans will be being able to watch it happen. Also, watch out for Mother Nature. In some parts of the country, she's not going to be playing nice.</p>

      <h1>My friend Pancho’s long life is a gift. Most racehorses never get that chance | Elizabeth Banicki</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>On Breeders’ Cup weekend the thoroughbred is celebrated. My aging friend reminds me that the same industry too often steals dignity from the young horses who run for our entertainment</p>
<p>My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.</p>
<p>As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.</p>

<p>However – China aside – analysts were left asking just how much Asian nations got out of it.</p>

<p>Jackson completed 18 of 23 passes in his first start since Week 4 against Kansas City, and the Ravens won their second straight as they attempt to make a run in <a href="https://www.nfl.com/standings/">the wide-open AFC North</a>. The Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3) top the division ahead of the Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals, who have 3-5 records. The Ravens <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/schedule/">have a favorable schedule</a> going forward, and will face only one team currently over .500 – the Steelers – in their next six games. They hope to become only the fifth team in NFL history to make the playoffs after losing five of their first six games.</p>

<p>The Senate hearing for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s nominee for surgeon general, Casey Means, has been postponed after the nominee went into labor with her first child.</p>
<p>Means had planned to make history as the first nominee to appear virtually before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> health, education, labor and pensions committee due to her pregnancy on Thursday. The hearing was originally scheduled for two days after her due date, a person familiar with the matter told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor">CNN</a>. It remains unclear when the hearing will be rescheduled.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have pulled U.S.-China relations back from the brink. China says both sides will suspend plans to expand export controls — the U.S. on advanced tech and China on rare earths — and Trump will reduce tariffs on China’s exports by 10%. Plus, Meta stocks are down in the dumps, and the Netherlands is experiencing growing pains in the clean energy transition.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Ballydoyle squadron is at the heart of the European challenge in California this weekend</p>
<p>Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Trump says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed with China</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Overall US tariffs on Chinese goods will be lowered to 47% after talks. Plus: the far right loses support in Dutch election</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade">Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths</a> after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>What else was agreed?</strong> Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.</p>
<p><strong>Was Taiwan discussed?</strong> No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.</p>
<p><strong>When did the U</strong> <strong>S</strong> <strong>last hold a full nuclear weapons test?</strong> In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.</p>

      <p>If nothing changes before the weekend, most of the 42 million people on food stamps, or SNAP, will not get their November benefits as scheduled. The interruption for people who rely on SNAP to buy food would be significant but could also have broader ripple effects across the economy, as SNAP generates jobs, wages, and taxes. Also: the track record of past New York City rent freezes and the likelihood of future rate cuts this year.</p>

      <p>Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights</p>
<p>A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The US started off badly with a loss to Portugal, recovered a bit with a win against the same team, and finished with a romp over New Zealand</p>
<p>More than three months after their last match, the US women’s national team returned to the pitch in October, playing three games with varied results. In the first, an impressive Portugal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/23/uswnt-portugal-friendly-alex-morgan-farewell">broke down the Americans</a> in a 2-1 win for the visitors. Emma Hayes played an almost entirely different, much younger lineup in the rematch, and the Americans returned the favor, 3-1. A somehow even younger lineup in the third game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/29/uswnt-emma-sears-hat-trick-new-zealand-friendly">steamrolled a limp New Zealand</a>, 6-0. The Portugal games offered many lessons; the Football Ferns were less scary than 11 jack-o’-lanterns would be, so that third match was more of a fun romp than a true test.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the window:</p>

      <p>With ticket sales phases under way and prices reaching eye-watering levels, my experience raised a crucial question: who is this World Cup for?</p>
<p>For months, people in my life had been asking me when and where to get World Cup tickets. In the absence of any actionable information from Fifa before the first round of the pre-sale opened up, they hoped, I guess, that I had inside knowledge.</p>

      <h1>Revealed: ICE violates its own policy by holding people in secretive rooms for days or weeks</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.</p>
<p>These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.</p>
<p>ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.</p>
<p>Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.</p>
<p>In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.</p>
<p>The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.</p>

      <p>Soumaya Hamdi says she has barely spoken to Sami Hamdi since he was taken over his pro-Palestinian advocacy</p>
<p>The wife of a British political commentator who was detained by immigration authorities while on a speaking tour of the US said she had only been able to speak with him for “30 seconds” since he was taken into custody on Sunday over his pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>
<p>Soumaya Hamdi told the Guardian she first learned her husband, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/ice-detains-british-muslim-journalist-laura-loomer">Sami Hamdi</a>, was detained at San Francisco international airport when a friend asked her to confirm rumors he had been “abducted by ICE”. When he was finally able to briefly call her, Hamdi only had enough time to say he had been taken to an immigration detention center in McFarland, California, where he remains.</p>

      <h1>California's public GPU infrastructure experiment</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Graphics processing units are essential to training and deploying artificial intelligence models, but they don’t come cheap. Big Tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and xAI have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-xai-memphis-tennessee-power-dec4c70d?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh8TMJVebO4VkgnG02PFQHAGob4d-6ZCUAtiOp9-ymc1LpnDbGcp4ztR5di56s%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68e831df&amp;gaa_sig=RE-tFHO-41Hh_JS6gSRQDxI7vYowYsu3rUDmiK2hbCvCjIU3t8R_R1CXrBru2E-5JieZT-Ejr1IFapOlxpNrYQ%3D%3D">spent billions</a>, amassing hundreds of thousands or even millions of them.</p>
<p>For those without such deep pockets, access to this kind of computing power has gotten out of reach. Recently, the state of California launched an initiative called <a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260sb53">CalCompute</a> to look into building its own public GPU cluster for startups and non-profit researchers to use. There are similar public compute pilots in <a href="https://www.empireai.tech/">New York state</a> and at the <a href="https://nairrpilot.org/about">federal level</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Quarterbacks such as Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield have gone from busts to MVP candidates. The Chargers backup is in the ideal place to make a similar journey</p>
<p>The development path for young NFL quarterbacks is brutal. They get lobbed in at the deep end as franchises try to figure out if their investment was worth it, before being tossed overboard if things go wrong. The league eats its young. The path from potential franchise starter to career backup – or out of the league – has never been shorter.</p>
<p>And that path has been expedited almost by design. In part, that’s due to the rookie pay scale, which allows teams to move on from perceived misfires early. It’s also down to a shift in evaluations. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson broke the mold for everyone. They redefined what a starting quarterback could look like, the skills needed, and the speed of development.</p>

<p>Trey Yesavage delivered a brilliant performance and Davis Schneider homered on the very first pitch of the night as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6–1 on Wednesday, moving within one victory of their first World Series championship since 1993.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Yesavage, who made his major league debut in September, struck out 12 without issuing a walk – the first pitcher in World Series history to do so – while allowing one run on three hits across seven innings. The rookie right-hander, who began the year pitching before a few hundred fans in the minor leagues, has now started and won two of Toronto’s three victories in the best-of-seven series.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)

      <p>Nvidia's market valuation surged to $5 trillion Wednesday, breaking records. The chipmaker is on fire, and it’s using its glut of resources to invest in other tech firms that need those chips. But if companies are using Nvidia money to buy Nvidia chips … should investors fret about a bubble?

<p>Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025. The company brought in record quarterly revenue but reported a major tax bill that dampened earnings per share, the company announced on Wednesday. The financial results come as Meta ends a multibillion-dollar hiring spree focused on artificial intelligence talent.</p>
<p>The tech giant earned <span class="math inline">\(51.24bn in quarterly revenue, beating Wall Street expectations and the company’s own projections for third-quarter sales. However, it reported earnings per share (EPS) of \)</span>1.05, far below Wall Street expectations of <span class="math inline">\(6.70 in EPS.

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.</p>
<p>Trump has asked the justice department to pay him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html">$230m in damages</a>, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>In November 2015, in the midst of what was then considered a long-shot campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump released a book called Crippled America. In it, Trump set out his ideas about what was wrong with the US: immigrants, mostly, but also Barack Obama, the “often pathetic” media, and the “total losers” in Congress.</p>
<p>The book, the 18th in <a href="https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order">the Trump canon</a>, is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.</p>

      <p>Exclusive: George Mason University accused of censorship by citing IHRA definition to order anti-Israel post’s removal</p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian students are threatening to sue George Mason University in Virginia after the school cited a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/23/antisemitism-redefinition-jewish-safety-christian-nationalism-democracy">contentious definition of antisemitism</a> it recently adopted to demand the removal of a social media post in which they described Israel as a “genocidal Zionist state” and the US as “the belly of the beast”.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the public university’s administrators on Wednesday, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter argued that the video amounted to “political expression on a matter of public concern, and thus the very speech the first amendment is meant to protect”.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Researchers figure livestock herds contribute between 12% and 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's mostly methane from the digestive process. But a study from UC Davis finds that, when fed seaweed early on, cattle’s microbiome can be altered, reducing the amount of methane emissions. But first, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point — though they have limited data to go off of.</p>

      <h1>Toyota denies promising to invest $10bn in US after Trump announcement</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)

      <p>The US president claimed he had been told the carmaker was going to be setting up factories ‘all over’ the US</p>
<p>The Japanese auto giant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/toyota">Toyota Motor</a> has denied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> suggestion that it is poised to invest more than $10bn in the United States over the coming years.</p>
<p>On a visit to Japan earlier this week, the US president claimed he had been told that the carmaker was going to be setting up factories “all over” the US “to the tune of over $10bn”.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>The Dodgers star pitched in Game 3 just 18 hours after setting records with the bat. It’s a reminder of how he makes the miraculous seem mundane</p>
<p>Even Shohei Ohtani’s teammates struggle to find the right adjectives to describe him; ones that express how good he is while emphasizing how unlikely his existence is in the first place.</p>
<p>After Monday’s Game 3, when Ohtani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/28/world-series-game-3-freeman-walkoff-ohtani-dodgers">became the first player</a> in postseason history to reach base nine times in a World Series game, Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman opted for “unicorn,” one of the more common Ohtani descriptors. Starting pitcher Blake Snell, meanwhile, put things simple and plain.</p>

<p>The 777X was central to Boeing’s long-term widebody strategy, previously dominated by its 747 and 777 jets. But repeated certification and production delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than $15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.</p>

      <h1>A potential pullback in auto lender oversight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Bankruptcies appear to be mounting in the subprime auto lending business. This all comes as auto loan delinquencies are rising, and the price of new and used cars stays stubbornly high. Amid all this, the Trump administration is quietly exploring a rollback of federal supervision of subprime auto lenders. Then, could federal law override state law that prevents medical debt from affecting your credit score? Plus, OpenAI goes from non-profit to for-profit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Correction (Oct. 29, 2025):</em></strong> <em>The introduction for the story about Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight of auto loan lenders in this episode contained an error that has been corrected. The threshold for which companies the CFPB can investigate involves how many loans those companies originate.</em></p>

<p>Rory Delap was apparently ahead of his time. The spirit of Stoke City’s legendary ball flinger lives on with the long throw-in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/10/long-throw-in-premier-league-brentford-dave-challinor">enjoying a renaissance</a> in the Premier League this season. Indeed, statistics show that the number of long throw-ins per match has more than doubled from last season, pointing to a very real and meaningful trend.</p>

      <h1>“China’s H-1B” talent visa gets praise abroad and backlash at home</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Beijing is making it easier for global science and tech talent to visit or do business in China. Chinese officials opened a new K visa for graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to do research and start companies. This comes as the U.S. is cutting research grants and choking H-1B talent visas. Overseas, analysts say America’s loss could be China’s gain. But within China, there is a lot of anger over the K visa. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak explains from Shanghai.</p>

      <p>High on agenda for the leaders of the US and China will be rare earths and tariffs, with a chance of a relationship reset</p>
<p>Ahead of Thursday’s long-awaited first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/trump-and-xi-talks-what-will-be-on-the-agenda-when-us-president-meets-chinas-leader">meeting</a> between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping since the US president’s return to office, officials from both sides have been hammering out the contours of what a trade deal between Washington and Beijing might look like, an agreement that could bring an end to months of global economic chaos caused by the US-China trade war.</p>
<p>The two leaders have not met in person since 2019. Since then, the war in Ukraine and increasing concern in Washington about China’s technological advances, as well as longstanding issues about the imbalanced US-China trade relationship, have strained the bonds between the two superpowers.</p>

Farah Nasser says Grok asked her 12-year-old son to send it nude photos during an innocent conversation about soccer. Tesla and xAI didn't respond to CBC's questions about the interaction, sending what appeared to be an auto-generated response stating, &quot;Legacy media lies.&quot;</p>

<p>The US Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would terminate Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president’s trade war.</p>
<p>The legislation passed in a 52-48 vote, with five Republicans – senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky – joining all Democrats in favor. The vote took place on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/government-shutdown-senate-vote-fails">day 28</a> of the federal government shutdown with both sides at loggerheads over spending legislation.</p>

History tells us when a new technology comes along and totally overhauls society (think, the steam engine), we end up with new, better jobs. So … why have we only heard about AI-related job elimination?

<p>A coalition of more than two dozen states on Tuesday sued the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> over its decision to suspend food stamps during the government shutdown.</p>

      <h1>What a homeowners insurance bill of rights could do</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>More than half of homeowners say their insurance premiums went up in the last year, according to Consumer Reports. The biggest culprits? Inflation, construction costs, and extreme weather. In response, Consumer Reports has drawn up what it calls a &quot;Homeowners Insurance Bill of Rights,&quot; which it hopes will be adopted by states around the country. Today, we'll hear more. But first, Elon Musk has released an artificial intelligence-powered rival to Wikipedia.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Six NFL teams played in London this month. The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experience</p>
<p>It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving. Welcome to the International Series.</p>

      <p>Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office</p>
<p>US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a>’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. Nonetheless, Republicans maintained their findings cast doubt on Biden’s actions in office. And they sent a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, urging a full investigation – after Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/joe-biden-dismisses-donald-trump-inquiry-into-his-cognitive-decline-as-a-distraction">previously ordered a similar inquiry</a>.</p>

      <h1>Haitians helped boost Springfield’s economy – now they’re fleeing in fear of Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Ohio city’s economic fortunes spiral and local businesses suffer as Haitians leave due to administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies</p>
<p>Every morning, Alicia Mercado makes the 50-minute drive from her home in Columbus to Springfield, where she runs the Adasa Latin Market store. She opened the business next to a Haitian restaurant in 2023, having spotted a gap in the market for Caribbean and Latin foods – the neighborhood’s Haitian population was booming at the time.</p>
<p>But over the past year, she says her business, which includes an international money transfer kiosk, has taken a major hit.</p>

      <p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Co-founder accuses ice-cream brand’s parent of taking part in ‘corporate butt kissing’ of Donald Trump</p>
<p>The co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s has accused its owner of being part of a movement of “corporate butt kissing” of Donald Trump and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza.</p>
<p>Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago.</p>

      <h1>Does the central bank have enough data to go off of?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on interest rates today. Most of the government data the Fed usually considers when voting on rates isn’t available because of the shutdown. We did get a tardy consumer price index report last Friday, though, and the Fed also produces some data itself. But can that paint a clear enough economic picture? Also: why workplace insurance premiums are likely to climb.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> During the financial crisis of 2008, the crimes of Bernie Madoff came to light. The ripple effects of his Ponzi scheme — one of the biggest frauds in Wall Street's history — are still being felt today. Now, banking giant HSBC has put aside over $1 billion for litigation related to Madoff. And later, we'll learn more about India's hard-hit carpet industry and a sports betting scandal in Turkey.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>The former Raiders quarterback’s career was shortened by off-field issues. In his new book, he looks back at a complicated life</p>
<p>Marcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.</p>
<p>Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school. When Marinovich reached the NFL, it wasn’t just marijuana he was abusing.</p>

But his inclusion of alleged AI &quot;hallucinations&quot; as part of a self-represented bid to cut his property's assessed value in half may end up costing him money.</p>

<li>
<p>LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.</p>
<p>When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.</p>

<p>Indigenous communities in Canada believe the return of cultural objects from the Vatican Museum is a step towards reconciliation, but some stress that the items must be returned in a manner that reflects their sacred nature, including holding ceremonies for objects before they leave for Canada.</p>

<p>People who lived at Ontario Training Schools are suing the province, alleging abuse was rampant at the children's detention centres. Nearly eight years after a class action was launched, the case is still stuck in the civil system. Lawyers say it’s another casualty of underfunded courts.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has given conflicting answers to whether he will attempt to run for a third term in 2028. At first he said he hadn't really thought about it, but then went on to say he would be allowed to run as vice-president in 2028 if he wanted to. When pressed by a reporter asking whether he would rule out running for a third term, he said cryptically: ‘I mean you'll have to tell me.’ Later in the interview, however, he said he would rule out running as vice-president, saying: 'I think it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that'</p>

</ul>
<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the president has openly expressed interest in finding a way to stay in power beyond the two terms allowed in the US constitution. But his remarks on Monday provided more details into some MAGA minds’ thought process about how to pull it off.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said: “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>

      <p>The federal shutdown is already having intense effects on unpaid federal workers. But we could be approaching a tipping point. In a memo, the USDA says about 42 million people will not get their SNAP benefits, starting Saturday. We'll hear more. Also, even if we don't get an inflation report, consumers are still pinched by rising prices. And, will Canada's transportation systems be ready for the FIFA World Cup next year?</p>

      <p>
      <p>Price increases are price increases, and consumers will bemoan inflation no matter the cause, right? Maybe not so much. Research shows that consumers tend to view inflation brought on by tariffs in a different light. Today, University of Chicago economist Alex Imas joins the program and uses behavioral economics to help make sense of it. But first, Louisiana will be building the first “rare earths separation facility” in the U.S.</p>

<p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p>
<p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p>
<p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p>

      <h1>Southeast Asian countries strike trade deals with U.S.</h1>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit is underway in Malaysia. So far, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia have all struck a series of trade agreements with President Donald Trump. Then, the party of Argentinian President Javier Milei saw major wins in Sunday's midterm elections, despite widespread discontent with deep austerity measures. And we'll learn about preparations for next summer’s FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted jointly by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in 16 different cities.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)

      <p>The four-time MVP faced his old team on Sunday night and put in a respectable performance. But it was Jordan Love who was able to control the game</p>
<p>It all started so well. And then it fell apart.</p>
<p>For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers">and a lone Super Bowl</a>. But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.</p>

<p>The Canadian Environmental Law Association is recommending that all cities pass bylaws to make it mandatory for property owners to replace lead pipes on their side of the property line. Hamilton has a bylaw aimed at preventing partial lead service-line replacements, and some Quebec and Saskatchewan have similar rules. Here's what people in Thunder Bay, Ont., have to say about the idea as the city faces a $350-million class-action lawsuit.</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gambling</p>
<p>The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.</p>
<p>Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims">were arrested Thursday</a> in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james">who allegedly provided</a> “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.</p>

It prompted hundreds of protesters to mobilize outside the Coast Guard base</p>

      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>US vice-president has criticised Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling the move a 'stupid political stunt' after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv’s international airport before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, JD Vance insisted that 'the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren't happy about it,' adding:'I personally take some insult to it'</p>

      <h1>Beef prices and the beef of tomorrow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

      <h1>Parsing the impact of fresh U.S. sanctions on Russian oil</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Tesla unveiled cheaper versions of some of its most popular cars. Other automakers are also promising to discount EVs or roll out more affordable models. This all comes following the end of federal tax credits that knocked as much as $7,500 off the price of a new EV. Also: a proposal that could grant crypto firms access to Fed infrastructure and a check-in with Cuba's tourism minister.</p>

      <p>Netflix is trying a new strategy to make more money: It's worked out a deal to stream some podcasts from Spotify, which have both audio and video. The deal means access to more consumer data and a new audience. And it's a move against a common competitor: YouTube. Also on the show: a change in tune on crytpo from a Federal Reserve leader and OpenAI's very own web browser.</p>

We'll do the numbers. And later in the program, tourism has long played a central part in Cuba’s economy. So what impact have the Trump administration’s new sanctions had?</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for tribal nations — as a force multiplier for hard-to-staff departments, a tool to better serve tribal citizens, and even to aid in the revitalization of Indigenous languages and culture.</p>
<p>But, as with all applications of AI tools, data security concerns loom. And some nations are adopting the new technology quicker than others. For an overview, Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Savannah Peters, who covers Indigenous communities for Marketplace.</p>

Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled. Also on the show: collective bargaining rights for Uber and Lyft drivers in California and a U.S.-Australia alliance concerning rare earth metals.</p>

      <p>Silver hit an all-time high last week. Helping fuel that rally is a physical shortage; global demand for silver has been outstripping supply since 2020. We'll hear about the supply of silver, which has more industrial uses than its flashier cousin, gold. Also, a Brazilian oil giant will start drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River. And coming soon to a convenience store near you: individual mini Coke cans.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high. But the conservative leader, who models herself after former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will have to tackle a range of economic challenges: a falling population, a rise in the cost of living, and sluggish growth.

Then, Bolivia's next president has said a priority will be tackling his country’s economic crisis. And as Diwali — the Hindu festival of light — begins, we'll ask how consumers in India are dealing with the rising price of gold, which is central to gift-giving there.</p>

      <h1>New CA law requires Uber and Lyft to bargain with drivers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>California has enacted a law requiring rideshare giants Uber and Lyft to collectively bargain with their drivers. Because the drivers are technically independent contractors, they otherwise would not have federally-protected labor rights like full-time employees. The new state law could be a game changer.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Levi Sumagaysay, reporter at CalMatters, who helps sift through the details of the law.</p>
