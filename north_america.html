      <h1>Washington's hydropower has created a data center boom. Some are concerned about its future.</h1>

      <p>
      In small town Washington — where hydropower is plentiful — data centers are creating jobs and funding amenities. But water and energy aren't unlimited — and some worry about long-term sustainability.

      <h1>Electricity prices are climbing more than twice as fast as inflation</h1>

      <p>
      Electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation.  That's especially costly during the dog days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.  In addition to hot weather, a variety of factors are causing power bills to climb, including the high cost of natural gas used to generate electricity and soaring demand from data centers.

      For most Americans, we just lived through the highest period of inflation in our lives. And we are reminded of this every time we go grocery shopping. All over TikTok, tons of people have posted videos of how little they got for … $20. $40. $100.

And those new, higher prices aren’t going away.<br><br>At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down. And yet, our fears or feelings that things will spiral out of control again? Those have not slowed down.<br><br>This mismatch has been giving us all the …. feelings. Inflation feelings. Infeelings. <br><br>On our latest show: we sort through our infeeltions. We talk to the economists who have studied us.

Today’s producer price index tells a different story: Wholesale prices grew a whopping 3.3% year-over-year. When might retailers pass those higher costs on to consumers? We break it down.

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month, claiming that the monthly jobs numbers — which were revised downward — were “rigged” to make him look bad. Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare? Also: a flare of inflation at the wholesale level and a comeback for adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>

      <p>In addition to the many considerations surrounding cost, those who lost homes in this year's California wildfires may also be looking for an environmentally-friendly way to rebuild that's able to withstand the next fire. Today, Marketplace's David Brancaccio explores mass timber, which doesn't burn easily, as an option for home reconstruction. But first, New York’s attorney general is suing the company that runs Zelle, alleging its customers were left open to fraud.</p>

In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal discusses that tension — as it appears in the show and in real life — with “Hacks” showrunners Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky.

      <p>Recently, President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after revisions depicted a weaker job market than initially thought. This week, Trump called on the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get rid of his chief economist, after the economist predicted that tariffs would force consumers to pay extra. What should consumers and investors make of this? We'll discuss. And later, we'll hear how French factories are benefiting from increased defense spending.</p>

Roughly 40% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and this precarity comes at a time when Social Security faces the possibility of benefit cuts. Plus, Trump's tariffs are generating billions in revenue monthly, and Brazil's president announced $5 billion to help smaller companies deal with tariffs.</p>

      <p>Ever read past the top line of the consumer price index? That 2.7% inflation rate varies a lot by metro area. The same goes for goods categories. So why is inflation higher in San Diego than Dallas? And higher for baby clothes and than electronics? We explain. Also in this episode: Long-term unemployment rises as hiring slows, businesses grow weary of waiting for tariff clarity, and we talk to Cheryl McKissack Daniel, CEO of the country's largest Black-owned construction firm.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

In the case of college sports, a recent lawsuit settlement involving the NCAA allows colleges and universities to pay their athletes directly.

      <p>Philadelphia, Boston, and Seattle have all experienced strikes by trash collection workers this summer. At their peak, more than 2,000 workers coast to coast walked off the job after contract talks stalled. The Teamsters Union representing the workers says members deserve a pay rise and better health care benefits. We'll hear from the picket line and customers affected. But first, a Texas-based manufacturer reflects on what all this tariff back-and-forth means for business.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It came right down to the wire, but the U.S. and China have extended their trade truce until November. This means those massive American tariff hikes — some as high as 145% — have been put on hold, as Beijing was ready to hit back with 125% tariffs. But could another 90 days be enough time to strike a deal? Plus, this summer, several U.S. cities have been gripped by trash collection strikes. We'll hear more.</p>

      <p>If President Donald Trump’s tariffs stymie the U.S. economy — which would, in turn, slow the global economy — oil demand will fall. And we're already operating at a surplus. In this episode, why the oil market tea leaves are difficult to read right now. Plus: Trump takes an “unprecedented” hands-on approach to Big Tech business dealings, and tariffs on semiconductors will make electronics more expensive. And, despite a six-year period of steep overall inflation, some prices have dropped. Can you guess which ones?</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>The U.S. and India, until about a week ago when steep tariffs went into effect, had been on track to forge strong ties in trade, defense, and other areas.

Also: a look at how the so-called “meme stock” effect has affected companies that have been boosted, and we talk with economist Julia Coronado about the possibility of a Fed rate cut in upcoming cycles. </p>
