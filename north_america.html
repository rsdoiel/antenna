<h2 id="judge-wont-block-musk-doge-from-federal-data-layoffs">Judge
won’t block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block
billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from
accessing government data systems or participating in worker
layoffs. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate
questions about Musk’s authority but said there isn’t evidence of the
kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining
order. </p>
<p>The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states
challenging DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. The
attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that
the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or
confirmed by the Senate. </p>
<p>The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs
are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public
cheering of the effort, Musk isn’t directly running DOGE’s day-to-day
operations himself. </p>
<p>DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with
the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and
searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing
number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. </p>
<p>Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include
New Mexico and Arizona. </p>
<p>“DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable
uncertainty and confusion,” she wrote. Their questions about Musk’s
apparent “unchecked authority” and lack of Congressional oversight for
DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them
later. </p>
<p>Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE’s work will
affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to
block specific, immediate harms, she found. </p>
<p>Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama,
previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case
against Trump in Washington.</p>

id="trump-signs-order-to-study-how-to-make-ivf-more-accessible-affordable">Trump
signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday
signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro
fertilization and make it more affordable. </p>
<p>The order calls for policy recommendations to “protect IVF access and
aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such
treatments,” according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump
called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court
nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of
restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have
threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at
conception. </p>
<p>Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also
signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second
executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of
Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more
transparency from the government, according to White House staff
secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the
orders. </p>
<p>The order called for “radical transparency requirements” for the
government, requiring it to detail the “waste, fraud and abuse” that’s
found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk,
looks to cut government spending. </p>
<p>DOGE has often fallen short of the administration’s promises of
transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since
becoming Trump’s most powerful adviser, and he’s claimed it’s illegal to
name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have
demanded access to sensitive government databases with little
explanation. </p>
<p>According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump’s IVF
order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies
“that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.” </p>
<p>Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama
Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under
state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives
cheered, touched off immediate backlash. </p>
<p>Families ‘appreciative,’ says Trump</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump,
who said he strongly supports its availability. </p>
<p>In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has
trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and
combining them in a lab dish with a man’s sperm to create a fertilized
embryo, which is then transferred into the woman’s uterus in an attempt
to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be
required. </p>
<p>“I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of
it,” Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions
on a variety of topics. </p>
<p>Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach,
Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview
with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. </p>
<p>Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of
Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House
and is set to air as Musk leads Trump’s effort to cut federal spending
and slash the federal workforce. </p>
<p>Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for
the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including
foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. </p>
<p>The Fox News interview also follows Musk’s appearance with Trump in
the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk’s approach to federal
cost-cutting. </p>
<p>In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday,
Musk said he “used to be adored by the left” but “less so these days”
because of the work he’s doing at Trump’s direction. </p>
<p>“They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don’t realize how real
this is until you can’t reason with people,” Musk said, adding that
normal conversations with Democrats about the president are difficult
because “it’s like they’ve become completely irrational.” </p>
<p>Event celebrates ‘American Exceptionalism’</p>
<p>Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club is the setting Tuesday night for an awards
program by America’s Future, a conservative group led by Mike Flynn, who
briefly served as national security adviser in the Republican
president’s first term. The program aims to preserve individual rights
and promote American values and traditions, according to its website.
The event, called Celebrate American Exceptionalism 2025, will honor one
member from the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Space
Force. </p>
<p>The event includes a poolside reception, musical performances and
dinner in Mar-a-Lago’s Grand Ballroom, where other award presentations
are expected from a lineup that includes such names as comedian Russell
Brand, singer Ted Nugent and former pro boxer Mike Tyson. </p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Trump will participate in the event.</p>

<h2 id="us-postal-service-head-to-step-down-after-5-years">US Postal
Service head to step down after 5 years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step
down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure
marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots
and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.</p>
<p>In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service
Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor.</p>
<p>“As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and
women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary
transformation,” he wrote. “We have served the American people through
an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and
sensationalized politics.”</p>
<p>DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020
during President Donald Trump’s first term. He was a Republican donor
who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first
postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal
employee.</p>
<p>DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem
losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to
“uncomfortable” rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its
finances and become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and
less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including
members of Congress from several states, have said the first
consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could
particularly hurt rural mail delivery.</p>
<p>DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a
contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on
long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to
create “a Postal Service for the future” that delivered mail more
quickly.</p>
<p>DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential
elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one
of the Postal Service’s cost-cutting practices after finding it
contributed to delays in mail delivery.</p>
<p>DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped
the agency’s longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck
deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some
mail was left to be delivered the following day.</p>
<p>DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being “as helpful
as possible in facilitating a transition.”</p>

<p>
Today we’re talking about bird flu. It’s infecting flocks of chickens,
causing egg prices to rise across the country, plus herds of dairy
cattle and people are getting sick too. And all of this is happening
amid sweeping changes at U.S. federal health agencies. The Trump
administration has ordered
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-disease-detectives-doge-cuts-health-agencies/">mass
firings</a> and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5297177/cdc-scientists-publications-trump-administration">limits
on public communications</a> at agencies including the Centers for
Disease Control, hindering its ability to keep the public informed. On
the show today,  Jessica Malaty Rivera, an epidemiologist and science
communicator explains the scale of the current bird flu outbreak, how
the response in the United States has been disrupted by chaos in the
federal government, and why state health systems may struggle to fill
the gaps after years of underfunding.

<h2 id="more-than-170-migrants-now-detained-at-guantanamo-bay">More than
170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of
detainees — both those deemed to be a “high threat” as well as others
slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. </p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration
calls “criminal aliens” under guard at the detention facility at
Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official.  </p>
<p>Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base’s
migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent
individuals.  </p>
<p>Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of
Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented
migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo
jets. </p>
<p>So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo
Bay have been deported to other countries. </p>
<p>Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to
discuss details of the military’s deportation operation. </p>
<p>VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security,
which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of
detainees. </p>
<p>Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees
operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there
were about 68 detainees at the base’s prison facility. </p>
<p>Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base’s migrant
facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees.
Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent
migrants slated for deportation.  </p>
<p>Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost
to house the growing number of individuals.  </p>
<p>“We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,” he said
during Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
“We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will
come. So, we’re waiting at this point.”    </p>
<p>Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval
base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security
unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning
migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. </p>
<p>“If you are considering entering America illegally, don’t even think
about it,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video
targeting an international audience. </p>
<p>“If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you
down,” she said. “Criminals are not welcome in the United States.” </p>
<p>Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the
transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has
repeatedly described the men as “murderers and vicious gang members”
from Venezuela and as “the worst of the worst.”   </p>
<p>In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants
sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted
for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and
impersonation. </p>
<p>One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held
at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has
not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the
crimes the detainees are accused of committing.   </p>
<p>Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with
several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging
the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been
improperly denied access to lawyers.  </p>
<p>DHS has dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.  </p>
<p>“There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,” said a
senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with
VOA.  </p>
<p>“If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly
dangerous criminal aliens including murderers &amp; vicious gang members
than they do about American citizens — they should change their name,”
the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of
anonymity.</p>

snubs South Africa’s G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg  — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers
from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief
diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that
he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in
Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he
described as anti-American.</p>
<p>He said South Africa was “using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality,
&amp; sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is
to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or
coddle anti-Americanism.”</p>
<p>DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President
Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive
order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>“I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t
think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity,
and these sorts of things,” Rubio later told the press.</p>
<p>He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues “like
terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national
security of multiple countries.”</p>
<p>The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as
well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an
African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20.</p>
<p>While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has
confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at
a lower level.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation
responded to Rubio in a statement saying: “Our G20 Presidency, is not
confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations
of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.”</p>
<p>Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation,
told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members
of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the
one in Brazil last year.</p>
<p>Deteriorating relations</p>
<p>Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in
the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in
U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in
Washington.</p>
<p>President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land
grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial
assistance to the country.</p>
<p>While the South African government did pass a controversial land
reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white
minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and
owns the majority of private farmland.</p>
<p>Response from other G20 members</p>
<p>Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the
meeting after Rubio said he will not attend.</p>
<p>Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose
ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were
“united in diversity” and shared the South African government’s
democratic values.</p>
<p>Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend.</p>
<p>“The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed
to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and
ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global
South.,” said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.</p>
<p>China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with
ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just
after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: “I also expressed China’s
readiness to support South Africa’s G20 Presidency.”</p>
<p>Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a
press briefing,</p>
<p>“China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a
productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism,
strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to
global challenges,” he said.</p>
<p>Analysts weigh in</p>
<p>Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for
countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas.</p>
<p>“Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing
their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US?
That’s entirely possible,” Steven Gruzd, from the South African
Institute of International Affairs, told VOA.</p>
<p>Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the
meeting was “a serious misstep.”</p>
<p>“You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means
your voice is not heard,” he said. “Calling the meeting “anti-American”
is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and
multi-lateral discussions.”</p>
<p>However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the
major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will
take on the presidency of the G20.</p>

id="rubio-us-looks-for-fair-sustainable-end-to-russian-war-on-ukraine">Rubio:
US looks for ‘fair, sustainable’ end to Russian war on Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United
States is working toward a “fair” and “sustainable” solution to end
Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would
have to make concessions to achieve peace.</p>
<p>Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials
met for more than four hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the
war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship. </p>
<p>“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that’s fair,
enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,” Rubio
told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the
table for the talks.</p>
<p>Rubio said he was “convinced” that Moscow was willing to engage in a
“serious process” to end the war, which Russia started with a full-scale
invasion of its neighbor three years ago next week.</p>
<p>Lavrov had a similar upbeat view of the talks, saying, “We weren’t
just listening to each other, but we heard each other. I have reason to
believe that the American side started to better understand our
positions.”  </p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with
Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst
conflict since World War II.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Russia agreed to “appoint respective high-level teams to
begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as
possible,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
Bruce characterized the meeting as “an important step forward” toward
peace.</p>
<p>Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in
talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S.
would have “extraordinary opportunities … to partner” with Russia on
trade and other global issues.</p>
<p>“The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict,” he said.</p>
<p>National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve
Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks.</p>
<p>Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus
on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>“This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end,
as we’ve seen in the past,” Waltz said.</p>
<p>Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally
recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it
unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern
Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and
lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of
Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved
into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each
side.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long demanded that his
country’s 2014 boundaries be restored, but U.S. officials have said that
is unrealistic, as was Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the
West’s main military alliance, as part of a negotiated peace
settlement.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy has said it will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated
settlement of the war.</p>
<p>He postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled for this
week, citing the fact that officials from his country were not invited
to Tuesday’s U.S.-Russia talks. The Ukrainian leader suggested that he
wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks and rescheduled the
trip for March 10.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg,
for talks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions
between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the
groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the
war.</p>
<p>She said the two sides would “establish a consultation mechanism to
address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of
taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective
diplomatic missions.”</p>
<p>Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would “lay the groundwork for future
cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic
economic and investment opportunities” once the war is ended.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who
in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in
discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in
what they also see as a key development for their own security.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders
for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense
spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>
<p>There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine
as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain
and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said that discussion was premature.</p>

id="leonard-peltier-leaves-prison-after-biden-commuted-sentence-in-killing-of-fbi-agents">Leonard
Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI
agents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was
released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President
Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life
sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.  </p>
<p>For nearly half a century, Peltier’s imprisonment has symbolized
systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe
in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home
confinement was celebrated by supporters.  </p>
<p>“He represents every person who’s been roughed up by a cop, profiled,
had their children harassed at school,” said Nick Estes, a professor of
American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of
the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier’s release.  </p>
<p>But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism
from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director
Christopher Wray, who called him “a remorseless killer” in a private
letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. </p>
<p> “Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is
wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,” Wray
wrote.  </p>
<p>The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something
Peltier’s advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his
innocence.  </p>
<p>Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a
prison official. He didn’t stop to speak with reporters or his
supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said
Peltier was looking forward to going home.  </p>
<p>“We’re so excited for this moment,” Jones said. “He is in good
spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.”  </p>
<p>After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison,
Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to
celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. </p>
<p> Biden commuted Peltier’s sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most
of his life in prison and was now in poor health.  </p>
<p>“We never thought he would get out,” Ray St. Clair, a member of the
White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before
Peltier’s release. “It shows you should never give up hope. We can take
this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.” </p>
<p>Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa
Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement,
which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights
and tribal self-determination.  </p>
<p>The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the
former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in
1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands
including the restoration of tribal land.  </p>
<p>After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI
surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to
disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975.  </p>
<p>Peltier’s conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the
Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which
FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed.  </p>
<p>According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants
for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained
at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank
range.  </p>
<p>Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance,
but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen
Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had
been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and
given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members,
co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the
grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July
and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.  </p>
<p>“Leonard Peltier’s release is the right thing to do given the serious
and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his
nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,” Paul O’Brien,
executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement
before Peltier’s release. “While we welcome his release from prison, he
should not be restricted to home confinement.”  </p>
<p>Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the
American Indian have called for Peltier’s release for decades, and
Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner.  </p>
<p>Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director
Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson
Browne.  </p>
<p>Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple
presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a
member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the
secretary’s position, praised Biden’s decision. “I am grateful that
Leonard can now go home to his family,” she said Jan. 20 in a post on X.
“I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this
means to Indian Country.”  </p>
<p>As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a
boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the
same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical,
psychological and sexual abuse.  </p>
<p>“He hasn’t really had a home since he was taken away to boarding
school,” said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier’s release
since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led
advocacy group based in South Dakota. “So he is excited to be at home
and paint and have grandkids running around.”</p>

id="social-security-head-steps-down-over-doge-access-of-recipient-information-ap-sources">Social
Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP
sources</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Social Security Administration’s acting commissioner
has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of
Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient
information, according to two people familiar with the official’s
departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
<p>Acting Commissioner Michelle King’s departure from the agency over
the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after
King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to
sensitive information, the people said Monday.</p>
<p>The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland
Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday
night saying: “President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and
talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and
we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the
meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud
expert as the acting commissioner.”</p>
<p>Fields added, “President Trump is committed to appointing the best
and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of
the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them
for far too long.”</p>
<p>King’s exit from the administration is one of several departures of
high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers’ potential unlawful
access to private taxpayer information.</p>
<p>DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to
access Internal Revenue Service databases.</p>
<p>Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House,
his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal
agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE
group.</p>
<p>Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group
for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE’s efforts
that “there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my
understanding is that it has already occurred.”</p>
<p>“The information collected and securely held by the Social Security
Administration is highly sensitive,” she said. “SSA has data on everyone
who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans,
everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied
for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental
Security Income.”</p>
<p>“If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone
could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the
Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”</p>
<p>The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and
was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million
people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social
Security benefits.</p>

drone attack hits central Ukraine apartment building</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian
city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three
people.</p>
<p>Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack
took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people
from the building and that those injured included a mother and two
children.</p>
<p>The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight,
which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts
taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv,
Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and
Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a
destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian
drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over
Belgorod.</p>
<p>Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are
frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks.</p>
<p>Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no
reports of casualties or damage.</p>

Russian officials meet to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Top U.S. and Russian diplomats met for several hours Tuesday in Saudi
Arabia about relations between their countries and a potential end to
Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both sides tempered expectations ahead of time, describing the talks
as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, which
included national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy
Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>Russia’s side included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior
Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy
for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who
in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in
discussions about its own future, and for European nations to play a
role in what they also see as a key development in their own
security.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders
for a Monday session in Paris where they discussed boosting defense
spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>
<p>There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine
as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain
and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said that discussion was premature.</p>
<p>“We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this,
Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong
and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron said on
X.</p>
<p>The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after
the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and
Ukrainians to work together.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy expressed a need for “robust and reliable” security
guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war
with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="costa-rica-will-receive-deported-migrants-from-us">Costa Rica
will receive deported migrants from US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive
migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States,
following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala.</p>
<p>“The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United
States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country,”
the Costa Rican president’s office said in a statement, adding that
“these are people originating from … Central Asia and India.”</p>
<p>Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on
repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President
Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. </p>
<p>The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday
aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they
will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border
with Panama. </p>
<p>The statement specified that “the process will be completely
financed” by the U.S. government under the supervision of the
International Organization for Migration. </p>
<p>Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement
when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of
Latin America. </p>
<p>Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants
aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and
elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in
Guatemala.</p>
<p>Latin America is the original home of most of the United States’
estimated 11 million undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>Many had made dangerous journeys, braving treacherous terrain, wild
animals and criminal gangs for a chance at a better life.</p>
<p>Trump, however, took a hard line against undocumented migrants during
last year’s U.S. election campaign, describing some as “monsters” and
“animals.”</p>
<p>On his first day in office last month, Trump declared a national
emergency at the southern U.S. border and vowed to deport “millions and
millions” of migrants.</p>

id="four-top-new-york-city-officials-resign-as-turmoil-ripples-over-mayors-corruption-case">Four
top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor’s
corruption case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are
resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department’s push to
end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in
President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has
raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to
lead the city.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy
Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi,
Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy
Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges,
I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the
future,” said Adams, who faces several challengers in June’s Democratic
primary. “But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving
forward, just as it does every day.”</p>
<p>City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to
call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor
resignations it’s clear he “has now lost the confidence and trust of his
own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor.</p>
<p>Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff
in a memo that they were exiting because of “the extraordinary events of
the last few weeks.”</p>
<p>They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they
and Parker will remain “for the time being to ensure a seamless
transition.”</p>
<p>Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department’s
second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to
drop the mayor’s corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil
Bove wrote that the case had “unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to
devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and
violent crime.”</p>
<p>That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department
and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting
in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and
fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign.</p>
<p>On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and
a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and
filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the
case. Ho has yet to take action on the request.</p>
<p>Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to
charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign
contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to
buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to
be mayor.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking
to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which
critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican
president’s objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the
case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter
after the November election.</p>
<p>“It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor
hostage,” Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. “I have
supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even
for him — of essentially political blackmail.”</p>
<p>Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria
Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio
Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy
Hochul has said she’s taking a more deliberative approach.</p>
<p>“The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot
as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated
reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,” she told
MSNBC on Thursday. “I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m
consulting with other leaders in government right now.”</p>
<p>The drama over Adams’ legal case played out as the mayor met with
Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased
cooperation on the Trump administration’s efforts to remove immigrants,
including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the
city’s notorious Rikers Island jail.</p>
<p>In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi
and Williams-Isom wrote, “Due to the extraordinary events of the last
few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and
our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from
our roles.”</p>

id="trump-begins-firings-of-faa-air-traffic-control-staff-just-weeks-after-fatal-dc-plane-crash">Trump
begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal
DC plane crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration began firing several hundred
Federal Aviation Administration employees on a busy air travel weekend
and just weeks after a January fatal midair collision at Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport.</p>
<p>Probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday
notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the
Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and
navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told The
Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk
to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>A Transportation Department official told the AP late Monday that no
air traffic controllers were affected by the cuts and that the agency
has “retained employees who perform critical safety functions.” In a
follow-up query, the agency said they would have to look into whether
the radar, landing and navigational aid workers who were fired were
considered to handle critical safety functions.</p>
<p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief
statement Monday it was “analyzing the effect of the reported federal
employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system
and our members.”</p>
<p>Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and
classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in
2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program
that was in part funded by the Defense Department. It’s one of several
programs that the FAA’s National Defense Program manages that involve
radars providing longer-range detection around the country’s
borders.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically
provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no
institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one
of the employees in that branch who was terminated.</p>
<p>The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working
on it are “about protecting national security,” Spitzer-Stadtlander
said. “I don’t think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, oh
no big deal, he just works for the FAA.”</p>
<p>“This is about protecting national security, and I’m scared to
death,” Spitzer-Stadtlander said. “And the American public should be
scared too.”</p>
<p>Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. Friday and continued
late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or
barred from entering FAA buildings Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>The employees were fired “without cause nor based on performance or
conduct,” Spero said, and the emails were “from an ‘exec order’
Microsoft email address” — not a government email address. A copy of the
termination email that was provided to the AP shows the sending address
“ASK_AHR_EXEC_Orders@usfaa.mail.outlook.com.”</p>
<p>The firings hit the FAA as it is facing a shortfall in controllers.
Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and
understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a
series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons
they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long
shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.</p>
<p>In the January 29 fatal collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk
helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under
investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and
helicopter traffic at the busy airport.</p>
<p>Days before the collision, President Donald Trump fired all the
members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by
Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The
committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and
airports.</p>
<p>Spitzer-Stadtlander suggested he was targeted for firing for his
views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general
probationary-level sweep. Both companies are owned by Elon Musk, whose
Department of Government Efficiency is leading Trump’s effort to cut the
federal government.</p>
<p>DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The
firings were first reported by CNN.</p>

id="american-arrested-in-moscow-on-drug-smuggling-charges-freed">American
arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug
smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S.
official. </p>
<p>The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and
Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport
after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his
baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul
with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he
had attempted to smuggle a “significant amount” of drugs into the
country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling,
punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. </p>
<p>Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news
outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A
U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released
to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive
matters. </p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response
to a question about Byers that Moscow expects “to discuss restoring the
entire complex of Russian-American relations” at the talks in Saudi
Arabia on Tuesday, “so certain events can be viewed in this
context.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether Byers’ fiancee was also released.
Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was
placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. </p>
<p>Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly
common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington
sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been
released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel,
a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to
those Byers had faced. </p>
<p>Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a
school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and
supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and
brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander
Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges
in the U.S., returned to Russia. </p>
<p>The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and
the U.S. appear to ease. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S.
policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia’s President
Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict
following a lengthy direct phone call.</p>

benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued
to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald
Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves.</p>
<p>France’s CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59,
while Germany’s DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged up
0.1% to 8,742.97.</p>
<p>U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.</p>
<p>In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the
Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected
annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports
and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then
recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at
39,174.25.</p>
<p>On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy
grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its
fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in
seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the
value of a nation’s products and services.</p>
<p>In other regional markets, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2%
to 8,537.10. South Korea’s Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while
the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83.</p>
<p>Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure
may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts
now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade
war.</p>
<p>His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full
effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and
other countries to negotiate.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is
to keep inflation at 2%.</p>
<p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a
barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08
a barrel.</p>
<p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen
from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.</p>

id="life-threatening-cold-hits-parts-of-us-following-deadly-weekend-flooding">‘Life-threatening
cold’ hits parts of US following deadly weekend flooding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, N.D. — Harsh cold descended on the nation’s midsection
Monday as a polar vortex gripped the Rockies and Northern Plains on the
heels of weekend storms that pummeled the Eastern U.S. with floods,
killing at least 14 people.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening cold” as
wind chills dropped to minus 51 Celsius in parts of North Dakota on
Monday and minus 46 C in parts of Montana. Tuesday morning was forecast
to be even colder.</p>
<p>Extreme cold warnings were issued for an 11-state swath of the U.S.
stretching from the Canadian border to Oklahoma and central Texas, where
the Arctic front was expected to bring near-record cold temperatures and
wind chills in the single digits by midweek.</p>
<p>Meteorologists had predicted that parts of the U.S. would experience
the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in
the Arctic are pushing chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Kentucky, Appalachia battered by flooding with at least 13 dead</p>
<p>The death toll in flood-battered Kentucky rose to 12, Gov. Andy
Beshear said Monday night. Two fatal vehicle crashes were connected to
the severe weather, he said, and at least 1,000 people stranded by
floods had to be rescued.</p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters of rain
as severe storms swept across the South. Water submerged cars and
buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, where there was one confirmed fatality with several
people still missing, Gov. Patrick Morrisey asked President Donald Trump
to issue a disaster declaration for a 13-county region ravaged by
flooding.</p>
<p>Near Logan, West Virginia, authorities responded Monday night to the
spill of acidic water from an abandoned coal mine. The mine blowout
damaged a road, making it impassable, fire officials said.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home
early Sunday.</p>
<p>Flood warnings were extended Monday across most of Kentucky and
portions of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia,
Virginia and Ohio.</p>
<p>Extreme cold gives the U.S. a taste of the Arctic</p>
<p>This is the coldest month of the year for many locations, and air
temperatures may approach record lows in some areas, said National
Weather Service meteorologist Jason Anglin in Bismarck.</p>
<p>People should cover exposed skin and limit time outside to avoid
frostbite, which can happen in minutes in such low temperatures, Anglin
said. Neighbors should check on each other and those who are vulnerable
and monitor heater vents to make sure they don’t ice up.</p>
<p>Due to the frigid conditions and a “lack of adequate heating fuel,”
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Monday waived hours-of-service
requirements for commercial-vehicle drivers hauling propane and
petroleum products. The waiver is for 30 days.</p>
<p>The cold snap in North Dakota was expected to reduce oil production
by about 5%, or about 50,000 to 80,000 barrels a day — pretty typical
for such conditions, North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin
Kringstad said. It takes about a week once temperatures warm up for
volumes to rebound, he said.</p>
<p>Death can happen in minutes for animals in such cold, said Julie
Schirado, a founder of the Bismarck-based Furry Friends Rockin’ Rescue
animal shelter. The shelter works with other rescues, and uses floor
kennels, heated garages and basements to house animals, she said.</p>
<p>“We see death a lot but when the cold temperatures hit, then it’s
jumped up some more. We lose kittens, puppies that are out in this
weather … Frostbite can be wicked,” Schirado said. People should bring
their pets indoors in extreme cold.</p>
<p>At the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, which closed last weekend due to cold,
critters such as bison, elk and bighorn sheep don’t mind the
temperatures as they munch food to stay warm and have shelters to enter,
Director Terry Lincoln said. And staff are still out, breaking through
ice for their water, he said.</p>
<p>Lincoln, who lives at the zoo, said he walked to his office on Monday
morning “and I had an ice-cream headache halfway there. You know it’s
cold when you have an ice cream headache without eating ice cream.”</p>

<h2 id="rubio-in-saudi-arabia-for-talks-on-fate-of-gaza">Rubio in Saudi
Arabia for talks on fate of Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to
discuss the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the fate of the Gaza
Strip if the war is ended.</p>
<p>The new top U.S. diplomat met with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman and Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan.</p>
<p>Their talks came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s call to move 2.3
million Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries, with the
United States then redeveloping the narrow territory along the
Mediterranean Sea and taking ownership of it, a plan Saudi Arabia and
other Arab nations oppose.</p>
<p>Rubio and the crown prince “underscored the importance of an
arrangement for Gaza that contributes to regional security,” State
Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said after the two officials met. She
did not mention any discussion of the Trump proposal.</p>
<p>Bruce said the two officials “reaffirmed their commitment to
implementing the ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring that Hamas releases all
hostages, including American citizens.”</p>
<p>Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, oppose Trump’s plan and
continue to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state,
including Gaza, to exist alongside Israel. For years, that also has been
the U.S. stance but now seemingly is at odds with any call for U.S.
ownership of the territory and removal of the Palestinians with no right
for them to return once it is redeveloped.</p>
<p>As such, Rubio has said Arab countries opposed to Trump’s Gaza
proposal should offer their own alternative suggestions on how to
rebuild the territory that has been decimated by 15 months of fighting
between Israel and Hamas militants. The warring sides are now in a
six-week truce that is tenuously holding but set to end in two
weeks.</p>
<p>Terms for the second phase of the ceasefire have yet to be
reached.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Monday its forces will remain in
five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after
Tuesday’s deadline for their withdrawal under a ceasefire with the
Hezbollah militant group. The move came as the region marked 500 days of
unrest linked to the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Lebanon’s government and Hezbollah are opposed to any further delay
in the Israeli troop withdrawal, which had already been postponed for
three weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, an Israeli drone attack struck a car in Lebanon’s
southern port city of Sidon, the deepest attack inside Lebanese
territory since the ceasefire took effect. Israel said it targeted
Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas’ operations in Lebanon. Footage
circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Trump’s Gaza takeover plan would seemingly eliminate his hopes of
getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, which Saudi
officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a
Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday,
with Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated” and “cannot continue
as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in
Jerusalem that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or
as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of
violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages on
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during the war with Hamas has killed more
than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry,
which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel,
without offering evidence, said it has killed over 17,000 militants.</p>
<p>The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to
release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian
prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of
Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be
negotiated.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27 and is working
with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to
be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the
expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>

Reuters.</p>

urges US to ‘correct its mistakes’ after State Department removes Taiwan
web reference</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to “correct
its mistakes” after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording
on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said
was part of a routine update.</p>
<p>The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s
opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which
claims the democratically governed island as its own.</p>
<p>But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan
independence,” the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a
Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the
U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations
“where applicable.”</p>
<p>Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan
or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as
encouraging Taiwan’s separate status from China.</p>
<p>The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S.
President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White
House.</p>
<p>Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun
said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department’s website
were a big step backwards and “sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan
independence separatist forces.”</p>
<p>“This is yet another example of the United States’ stubborn adherence
to the erroneous policy of ‘using Taiwan to suppress China’. We urge the
United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,” Guo said.</p>
<p>The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties
with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to
provide the island with the means to defend itself.</p>
<p>“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general
public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State
Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time
responding to questions on the updated website wording.</p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the
spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position
on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the
subject.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.
We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences
to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner
acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his
appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on
U.S.-Taiwan relations.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that
only the island’s people can decide their future.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic
of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in
1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up
the People’s Republic of China.</p>

Simon, Sabrina Carpenter open ‘Saturday Night Live’ 50th anniversary
celebration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th
anniversary special celebrating “Saturday Night Live” with a duet of his
song “Homeward Bound.”</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on “SNL” since its earliest
episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack.
He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment,
Carpenter.</p>
<p>“I sang this song with George Harrison on ‘Saturday Night Live’ in
1976,” Simon said.</p>
<p>“I was not born then,” Carpenter said, getting a laugh. “And neither
were my parents,” she added, getting a bigger laugh.</p>
<p>Fifty seasons of “Saturday Night Live” sketches, songs and special
guests are being celebrated for the special’s landmark anniversary in a
Sunday night special.</p>
<p>The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of
comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen
Wiig.</p>
<p>Many of those stars were on hand for “SNL50: The Anniversary
Celebration,” airing live from New York, of course.</p>
<p>“I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it’s
lived with me my whole life,” Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from
2001 to 2008,” said on Sunday ahead of the show’s start. “We have a show
to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing
privilege.”</p>
<p>The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of
“Saturday Night Live,” which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original
cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner.</p>
<p>“After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it
all for us,” Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the
show. “They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies.
We worshiped their movies. And that’s all. What we wanted to do is just
kind of continue that sort of stuff.”</p>
<p>It’s become appointment television over the years as the show has
skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for
the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered
television viewing, “SNL” sketches, host monologues and short comedy
films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of
views on YouTube.</p>
<p>While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of
the special’s moments, cameos and music performances remain a
surprise.</p>
<p>On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec
Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who’s hosted “SNL” the most
times.</p>

administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s administration has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S.
agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal
battle involving Trump’s actions to the nation’s highest judicial body
since he took office in January.</p>
<p>The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal
judge’s Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump’s removal of
Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while
litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing
reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the
court.</p>
<p>The federal judge’s action blocking the termination is an
“unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” Acting Solicitor
General Sarah Harris said in the filing.</p>
<p>“This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by
dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency
head against his will,” Harris wrote.</p>
<p>Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger’s five-year term
was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7
informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role,
“effective immediately.”</p>
<p>Dellinger’s lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to
fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for “inefficiency,
neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”</p>
<p>The Special Counsel’s “ability to protect the civil service and
investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,”
Dellinger’s lawsuit said. “Over the preceding three weeks, an
unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections
have been terminated without cause.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a
temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his
position pending a further, preliminary order.</p>
<p>Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that
the effort to fire him without identifying any cause “plainly
contravenes” the Special Counsel’s job protections under federal
law.</p>
<p>“This language expresses Congress’s clear intent to ensure the
independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being
buffeted by the winds of political change,” Jackson wrote in the
order.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the
administration’s appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was
premature, given that Jackson’s order was only temporary.</p>
<p>The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures
about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates
complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the
Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees.</p>
<p>The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration
to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal
government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as
independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a
reason.</p>

id="scientists-race-to-discover-depth-of-ocean-damage-from-los-angeles-wildfires">Scientists
race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific
Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the
Palisades Fire.</p>
<p>The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing
machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the
shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water’s edge. Waves during high tide
lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into
the ocean as they receded.</p>
<p>“It was just heartbreaking,” said Quinn, president and CEO of the
environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris
some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of
hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and
officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted
the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes,
businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous
ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and
more.</p>
<p>Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are
concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under
the sea.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so
close to the water,” Quinn said.</p>
<p>Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for
surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport
chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists
worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food
supply.</p>
<p>The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles
region last week exacerbated some of those fears.</p>
<p>When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias’ first concerns
was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash
far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality
manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.</p>
<p>Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash
and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore,
said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California,
San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and
shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled,
“not like a nice campfire.”</p>
<p>Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks
up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a
network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain “a lot of
nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn
material that can get into the water,” said Dias, as well as “heavy
metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn
different types of fuel.”</p>
<p>Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can
dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn
scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that
repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is
less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides
and debris flows increase.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set
thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to
prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors
also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand
beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for
potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.</p>
<p>Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are
testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and
aluminum and volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown
to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned
from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments,
paints and electrical equipment.</p>
<p>County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples
last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach
closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to
stay out of the water.</p>
<p>Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far
potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep
and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.</p>
<p>Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen
into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which
can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the
potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire
consequences, Dinasquet said.</p>
<p>“Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and
asbestos in the ash,” she added. “This is really bad for people so it’s
probably also very bad for the marine organisms.”</p>

<h2 id="us-presidents-day-how-it-evolved-from-reverence-to-retail">US
Presidents Day: How it evolved from reverence to retail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George
Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life.
He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.</p>
<p>And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first
president Monday, 293 years after he was born.</p>
<p>The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being
mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to
the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the
holiday has lost all discernible meaning.</p>
<p>Historian Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A
Biography of George Washington,” has said she thinks about Presidents
Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his
name.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to
anything that looks or sounds like him?” she remarked in an interview
with The Associated Press in 2024. “Jefferson and Lincoln are presented
as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their
memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down
to have absolutely no identifiable features.”</p>
<p>Here is a look at how things have evolved:</p>
<p>Washington’s birthdays were celebrated, sometimes</p>
<p>Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the
Potomac River in Virginia.</p>
<p>Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian
calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The
Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was
adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.</p>
<p>Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday,
according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that
manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at
Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.</p>
<p>“If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,” Coe
said. “Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de
Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But
that’s about it.”</p>
<p>Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when
he was president, mostly.</p>
<p>Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short
commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in
office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was
rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>“One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to
keep working through his birthday,” Coe said.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the
Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday
in 1782.</p>
<p>After his death, a market for memorabilia is born</p>
<p>Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its
distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a
king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in
Philadelphia, told the AP last year.</p>
<p>Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost
immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up
pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure
going off into heaven.</p>
<p>“Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism
with patriotic memory,” said Bruggeman, whose books include “Here,
George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public
History of a National Monument.”</p>
<p>Making it official with parades and festivals</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress
established a committee to arrange national “parades, orations and
festivals,” according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for
federal employees in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday,
although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments
have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date
falls nearby, on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s
birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And
some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s
Birthday.</p>
<p>A shift to consumerism</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal
holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week,
according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue
magazine.</p>
<p>Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns
that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a
holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the
economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day
weekends.</p>
<p>The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents
Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian
C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.</p>
<p>Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers “would have
been deeply worried” by how the holiday became taken over by commercial
and private interests.</p>
<p>“They were very nervous about corporations,” Bruggeman said. “It
wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little
republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.”</p>
<p>Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America,
said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.</p>
<p>“There’s no moment of reflection,” Coe said. Given today’s widespread
cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection “would
probably be a good idea.”</p>

id="rubio-plays-down-immediate-breakthrough-on-russia-ukraine-peace">Rubio
plays down immediate breakthrough on Russia-Ukraine peace</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Top U.S. officials headed Sunday to Saudi Arabia for talks with
Russian diplomats in the coming days on ending Moscow’s three-year war
on Ukraine, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed prospects for
an immediate breakthrough.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed
during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace
negotiations, but Rubio told CBS’s “Face the Nation” in an interview
aired Sunday, “A process towards peace is not a one- meeting thing.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is
interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine in a way that is
sustainable and fair,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security
adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while
a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there
in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The shape of the talks remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Rubio said he wasn’t even sure who Moscow was sending. “Nothing’s
been finalized yet,” he said, adding that the hope was for an opening
for a broad conversation that “would include Ukraine and would involve
the end of the war.”</p>
<p>Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with
Zelenskyy later saying that there should be “no decisions about Ukraine
without Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once “real
negotiations” begin, then Ukraine “will have to be involved.”</p>
<p>Hours before European leaders meet in Paris to address Washington’s
policy shift on the war in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Sunday that he was ready to send British
troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>“I do not say that lightly,” he wrote. “I feel very deeply the
responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen
and women in harm’s way.”</p>
<p>Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to
deter Russian President Putin from further aggression.</p>
<p>His article was meant to show the U.S. that European nations should
have a role in discussions on ending the nearly 3-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also warned that European countries
should do more for their collective security, as talks between the
United States and Russia loom.</p>
<p>The U.K. premier is due to join leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland,
Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark at the Paris meeting on Monday, just
days ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday,
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said, “I will never accept any decisions
between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in
Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin
is only pretending to want peace.</p>
<p>“I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is
that he’s ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he’s a
liar. He doesn’t want any peace.’”</p>
<p>The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the
conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during
a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support,
“Probably it will be very, very, very difficult” to defeat Russia. “And
of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we
will have low chance – low chance to survive without support of the
United States.”</p>
<p>Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized
territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in
2014 and the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured
after that and since the full-scale February 2022 Russian invasion.</p>

America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into
the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales
over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney
Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company
predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by
the end of Monday’s Presidents’ Day holiday.</p>
<p>It’s Marvel’s first major release since “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine”
broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some
worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”</p>
<p>Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World”
is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing
Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from
Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford
co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk.</p>
<p>But “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a
handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies
can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is
currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s not the worst
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and
“Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is
on the very low end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it
is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a
movie.”</p>
<p>Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified
audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a
B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend
audience.</p>
<p>The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog
Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.</p>
<p>And “Brave New World’s” showing is the middle range for an MCU film.
Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy”
and “Thor: The Dark World.”</p>
<p>It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel
movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding
the millions spent on marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>After only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first
of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by
“Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in
July.</p>
<p>“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but
audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,”
said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Second place at this week’s box office went to “Paddington in Peru,”
the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in
North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13
million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film
opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the
weekend with $104 million from its international run.</p>
<p>Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film,
which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by
Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton’s
voice, remained intact.</p>
<p>Sony and Screen Gems’ slasher “Heart Eyes” landed in third place with
$10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to
“Dog Man” with $9.7 million.</p>
<p>The Chinese blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” rounded out the top five. It
opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall,
the box office is up 20% from last year.</p>
<p>This weekend also saw the release of a new “Bridget Jones” movie,
subtitled “Mad About the Boy,” which went straight to Universal’s
streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and
Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing “Captain
America: Brave New World.” Universal Pictures International reported
$32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories.</p>
<p>The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $88.5 million.</p></li>

<h2 id="us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests">US ‘border
czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s “border czar” said Sunday he is “not
happy” with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by
immigration agents and deported to their home countries. </p>
<p>Tom Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” show that 14,000 migrants
had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said,
“We’ve got to do a lot more.” </p>
<p>Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or
sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba,
while some have been released to live in the United States pending court
proceedings. </p>
<p>The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living
in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency
to find and deport “millions” of them. Officials say that the first
arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that
anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation
could be targeted. </p>
<p>Homan said the number being deported is “a lot higher” than under the
former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, “We’ve got to
get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.” </p>
<p>The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from
several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration
issues. </p>
<p>In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of
migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day
in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer
than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. </p>
<p>The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a
day.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the
U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration
team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.</p>
<p>Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans</p>
<p>Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal
immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its
mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and
using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves
have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the
policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s
immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports.</p>
<p>US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</p>
<p>The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration
judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping
moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges
who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges
were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the
International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers,
which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under
similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in
Mexico</p>
<p>When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled
Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States.
But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on
asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month,
the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek
protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama</p>
<p>Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from
other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes
Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the
Central American nation’s president said Thursday. “Yesterday, a flight
from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse
nationalities of the world,” President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in
his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated
Press reports.</p>
<p>Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave
home</p>
<p>Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in
Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to
leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane
narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes.</p>
<p>Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas</p>
<p>An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for
any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two
speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for
people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw
nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city
of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there,
although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets
issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday
morning. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration
officials to operate at the city’s Rikers Island jail following a
meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump’s border czar. Adams said
he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation’s
largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior
administrations. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>VOA60 Africa - Nigeria: Thousands of refugees return from Chad</p>
<p>Thousands of Nigerians who fled to Chad to escape jihadi violence in
Nigeria’s northeast have returned after more than a decade. Around 3,600
refugees arrived in Maiduguri, the regional capital of Borno State,
aboard trucks.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Guam a doorway to US for Chinese asylum-seekers</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s immigration policy has mainly been focused
on migrants trying to cross into the U.S. at its border with Mexico,
some having made the perilous trek from as far as South America. Out in
the western Pacific Ocean, some Chinese are taking an equally dangerous
route to the U.S. VOA’s Yu Yao and Jiu Dao have their story, narrated by
Elizabeth Lee.</p>
<p>VOA Creole: Congressman asks Trump to renew TPS for Haitians</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York told VOA in an
exclusive interview that he will ask President Donald Trump to renew
Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. TPS will expire for current
holders in February 2026. Lawler told VOA that gang violence, drug and
arms trafficking, and an overall lack of security make it untenable to
deport the Haitians.</p>

<h2 id="rubio-hamas-must-be-eradicated">Rubio: Hamas ‘must be
eradicated’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with
Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated”
and “cannot continue as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous
Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet
to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S.
diplomat, told Netanyahu that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that
can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can
threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about
U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into
neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow
territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own
and redevelop.</p>
<p>While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza
plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a “common
strategy” for Gaza’s future.</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has
killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s
health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and
civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over
17,000 militants.</p>
<p>Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its
end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release
dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners,
drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But
the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could
complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite
suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of
Gaza.</p>
<p>Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to
continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming
it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top
leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli
military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who
approached its forces in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its
policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah,
on the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Hamas described the attack as a “serious violation” of the ceasefire
and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working
with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to
be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the
expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.</p>
<p>Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent
Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also
supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership
of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state
encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>
<p>Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020
Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with
Israel during Trump’s first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the
accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S.
defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations
with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.</p>

<h2 id="dead-including-8-in-kentucky-in-latest-winter-weather-blast">9
dead, including 8 in Kentucky, in latest winter weather blast</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least nine people have died in the most recent
round of harsh weather to pummel the U.S., including eight people in
Kentucky who died as creeks swelled from heavy rain and water covered
roads. </p>
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that hundreds of people
stranded by flooding had to be rescued. </p>
<p>Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old
child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. </p>
<p>“So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,” he said.
“This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the
Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the
line.” </p>
<p>Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes,
but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase
outages. </p>
<p>Much of the U.S. beyond Kentucky faced another round of biting winter
weather. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado
watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. </p>
<p>Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said earlier that the mother and
child were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In
southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters
in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle
Berry said. </p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches 15
centimeters (6 inches) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob
Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>“The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and
a lot of flooding going on,” Oravec said Sunday. “Any time there’s
flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.” </p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when an “extremely large tree” fell
on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott
Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before
5 a.m. after a 911 call. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains
with low temperatures into the minus 30s Celsius (minus 30s Fahrenheit)
near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in
the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit)
to minus 45.6 Celsius (minus 50 Fahrenheit) are expected. </p>
<p>Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and
northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph
(60 mph) and create “hazardous whiteout conditions,” the NWS said. </p>
<p>Kentucky faces severe flooding </p>
<p>Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked
roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were
under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National
Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. </p>
<p>Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday
in parts of Kentucky. </p>
<p>The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed
its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other
hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate
conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The
north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters
(14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service
said. </p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed
cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In
Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides. </p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters. </p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook. </p>
<p>New England faces snow, then sleet </p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet. </p>
<p>Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light,
due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. </p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa
and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts
of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of
snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan
by Sunday evening. </p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex </p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city
opened shelters for those living on the streets.</p>

id="white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-his-claims-they-are-victims-of-racism">White
South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims
of racism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for
President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in
Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own
government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters held placards that read “Thank God for
President Trump” and displayed other messages criticizing what they see
as racist laws instituted by the South African government that
discriminate against the white minority.</p>
<p>Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an
executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led
South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa’s
Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were
being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate
private land. </p>
<p>The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race
and says Trump’s claims over the country and the law have been full of
misinformation and distortions. </p>
<p>Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the
order referred to as “racially disfavored landowners” — when no land has
been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer
Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South
Africa’s white minority. </p>
<p>In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will
never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were
dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority
rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. </p>
<p>“The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,”
Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking
of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public
good. </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s criticism and punishment of South Africa
has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to
address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed
the Black majority. </p>
<p>According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the
inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by
whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country’s
population. </p>
<p>White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the
expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in
place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance
opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic
Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white
people.</p>
<p>Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa
— has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is
anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He
has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet
service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s
affirmative action criteria.</p>
<p>While race has long framed South African politics, the country has
been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in
the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a
coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are
working together.</p>

id="breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants.-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices">Breakfast
is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg
prices?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with
record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos
rancheros may be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant
chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its
locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants
in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another
Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.</p>
<p>Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks,
which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12
separate items containing eggs. Wendy’s reintroduced breakfast in 2020
and offers 10 items with eggs.</p>
<p>Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses
opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.</p>
<p>In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs.
But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to
slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds —
including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making
supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of
eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.</p>
<p>The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other
places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly
available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the
largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated
Press’ requests for comment.</p>
<p>But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic
at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals,
2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours
accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.</p>
<p>Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning
visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus
include eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took
off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and
connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw
breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he
said.</p>
<p>The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged
during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home
use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to
close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for
animal proteins at CoBank.</p>
<p>U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before
reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing
established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of
heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products
grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.</p>
<p>“Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you’re making something
with eggs, you know it’s fresh,” Earnest said.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted
supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating
more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is
available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.</p>
<p>Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal
rights concerns, McDonald’s and some other companies have switched to
100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten
states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting
egg sales to products from cage-free environments.</p>
<p>“It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,”
Earnest said.</p>
<p>The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices
hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the
beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices
since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the
door.</p>
<p>Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset
the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch
for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis,
the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers
Association.</p>
<p>First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical
for the chain’s brand and are found in the majority of its offerings,
whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So
far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and
isn’t charging extra for them.</p>
<p>First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like
meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees
to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.</p>
<p>“Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of
American diets,” Richardson said.</p>

man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus
attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company
that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and
did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.</p>
<p>Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a
hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and
crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed
against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a
horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including
at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the
couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died
shortly after, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>“We’re doing this because this should never have happened,” said Paul
Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law
partner, Nicole Coates. “There are basic safety standards that
businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the
safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences
here were absolutely devastating.”</p>
<p>Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been
determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders’ death and
keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving
interviews.</p>
<p>The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary
trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders
had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved
cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in
Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children
and a granddaughter.</p>
<p>The company’s lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or
reckless in connection with Lisa Manders’ death. He said African
Portfolio only arranged the couple’s lodging and the owners of the
lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and
is injured or killed. It’s awful,” Gould said. “I think it’s important
to understand what African Portfolio’s role in this is. It’s a tour
operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.”</p>
<p>He added, “My client didn’t conduct the safari. It arranged it. It
booked all the components.”</p>
<p>Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa,
because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will
either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go
to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses
signed for the trip.</p>
<p>In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the
lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were
accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an
armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety
measures were implemented before the attack and “repeated warnings” were
issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle “during the
incident.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the
attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that “the statement is
an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.” Gould
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after
the attack and joined Chiawa’s owner in ensuring that “everything
possible was being done to support the family and all those involved.
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone
else involved in this tragic incident.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are
“inherently dangerous activities” because of the unpredictability and
sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful
planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio
vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent,
qualified and trained to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that African Portfolio “encouraged and/or permitted”
the Manderses to be exposed to an “avoidable and highly dangerous
encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.” It
also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during
the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were
adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe
experience.</p>
<p>African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the
Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Hippos are the world’s second-largest land mammals after elephants,
measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs
about 3,200 kilograms.</p>
<p>Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year
before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern
African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized
it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each
year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.</p>
<p>Lisa Manders suffered “significant premorbid fear and emotional pain,
suffering and mental anguish” before her death, the suit says. Craig
Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological
injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily
routines, it says.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and
recklessness.</p>
<p>“He’s suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on
him and his life,” Slager said. “And he also has a claim for having
witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is
unthinkable. It’s unimaginable.”</p>

id="photos-lost-in-us-disasters-find-way-home-with-help-from-people-who-care">Photos
lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled
roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. </p>
<p>It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. </p>
<p>After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the
deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. “This storm has taken so
much,” she said, “and it’s so jarring to see the photos of the horrible
devastation.”</p>
<p>So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something
about the wide-scale loss. </p>
<p>While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she
stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in
tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family
reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and
school portraits. </p>
<p>“These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had
washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what
they were,” said Schenker, 27. “It stuck with me.” </p>
<p>To reclaim the search phrase “photos from Helene,” she created an
Instagram for “something positive, which is reuniting people with their
memories.” She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer
search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos —
or what she calls “little needles in a haystack.” </p>
<p>When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. </p>
<p>Then, sitting in her car, she cried. </p>
<p>Photos found amid muck </p>
<p>We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and
moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away
abruptly. </p>
<p>Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them
were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted
tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had
lived for almost 40 years. </p>
<p>“It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those
pictures. I just couldn’t even speak,” Moss said. “You don’t expect
something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.” </p>
<p>Months later, they’ve received some FEMA assistance and found a
temporary home, which they’re gradually furnishing with church
donations. But some things are irreplaceable. </p>
<p>“This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff
in there. But what’s been devastating is that that was everything we had
of Tommy,” she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic
disorder. “It’s those memories and the little things, the photos, that
you can’t replace.” </p>
<p>As Schenker later understood it, “When they lost their home, they
lost virtually all proof that this child existed.” </p>
<p>“It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people’s
lives,” she said. “They’ve literally lost everything and they can’t ever
recreate those childhood photos.” </p>
<p>In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss
family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a
Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in
yet another, he’s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother
Dallas. </p>
<p>“It is just breathtaking,” Moss said. “This is one thing that the
river didn’t get to take — or didn’t get to keep.” </p>
<p>Smoke, water, ash, soot</p>
<p>More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena
foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos
with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them
with their owners. </p>
<p>After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When
rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. “Someone has to
do this ASAP,” she remembers thinking to herself. “And I realized it had
to be me — because nobody else was doing it.” </p>
<p>Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold
can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the
deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe
off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, “driving
particles deeper into the material.” Some photos are so brittle, too,
that when touched they may disintegrate. </p>
<p>In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in
volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he
trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials,
whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. </p>
<p>Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly
set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks,
sheet music, and children’s art in nearby parks, neighbors’ front yards
and a golf course. </p>
<p>“The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in
with precious mementos everywhere you look,” she said. “It’s just
absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a
unit.” </p>
<p>Finding the photographed people</p>
<p>Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena
Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground.
Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to
Schwartz. </p>
<p>She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival
intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free,
glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a
temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. </p>
<p>Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of
teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is
flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. </p>
<p>“It’s funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,”
Schwartz said. “She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really
friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her
photos.” </p>
<p>Schwartz’s house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to
fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of
burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is
otherworldly and changed. “It looks like the moon. It looks like another
planet. It doesn’t look like home.” </p>
<p>Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home
and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints
and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. </p>
<p>“The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my
mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,” said
Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy,
as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. “We were both pretty
overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that
one.” </p>
<p>Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. “When you’re
picking up people’s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be
traumatic — even if they’re not yours,” he said. </p>
<p>When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or
hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide
range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all
at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities,
and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. </p>
<p>“Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,” Moss said.
“You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh
about it. Fortunately, we didn’t lose the most important thing. That’s
lives.”</p>

id="fistfights-anthem-boos-in-stormy-us-canada-ice-hockey-clash">Fistfights,
anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of
deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey
clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of
the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political
tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence
from the opening puck drop at Montreal’s Bell Centre.</p>
<p>The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final
Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a
footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a
fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.</p>
<p>With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans
booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have
become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S.
President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods
crossing U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Then came three fights in nine seconds.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s very indicative of what this means to the
players,” U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. “There’s two teams out there
that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective
teams and their countries.</p>
<p>“For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way
that it occurred – I think that’s an indication of it. What an
incredible hockey game.”</p>
<p>Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for
Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee
in the first moments was not prearranged.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t planned,” Cooper said. “That wasn’t two coaches throwing
guys over and saying ‘This is happening’ – none of that happened. That
was as organic as it gets.”</p>
<p>At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as
Canada’s Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began
swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to
give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.</p>
<p>Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and
tried to restart the game, only for Canada’s Sam Bennett and Brady
Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until
officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the
penalty box.</p>
<p>The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American
J.T. Miller and Canada’s Colton Parayko began the third and final
fight.</p>
<p>‘Jacked up’</p>
<p>Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start
beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a
move.</p>
<p>“These guys care very much about winning,” he said. “Brady and
Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion – and they’re leaders
in so many ways.</p>
<p>“It’s just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they
want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there’s a lot of energy
around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.”</p>
<p>Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off
against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of
Hockey, the league’s best traditionally skipping the world championships
and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018
PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>“It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled
in a minute and a half,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with
Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid’s goal 5:31 into the first
period.</p>
<p>But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel’s goal at 10:15 of the
first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin’s tally at
13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on
Guentzel’s empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.</p>

South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North
Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their
“resolute” pledge to seek the “complete denuclearization” of North
Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released
Saturday.</p>
<p>The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held
his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and
Japan’s top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute
commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),” it said.</p>
<p>“They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address
together the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber
activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military
cooperation with Russia,” it added.</p>
<p>The three sent a “strong warning” that they “will not tolerate any
provocations or threats to their homelands,” and vowed to maintain and
strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They also said they were committed to “the immediate resolution of
the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war
as well as the issue of separated families.”</p>
<p>Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and
under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons
program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for
years.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim
Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out
again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a “smart guy.”</p>
<p>Despite Trump’s diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January
that its nuclear program would continue “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any
“provocation” by the United States after Rubio called it a “rogue state”
in a radio interview.</p>
<p>It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval
base in South Korea this month as a “hostile military act.”</p>
<p>A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks
on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in
return.</p>

<h2 id="us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts">US fires
20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union
official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the
federal government. </p>
<p>On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant
chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew
Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional &amp;
Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges
were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. </p>
<p>It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice
Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the
courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond
to a request for comment Saturday. </p>
<p>Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases,
according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be
decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges
and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured
some judges to decide cases more quickly. </p>
<p>The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials,
including Mary Cheng, the agency’s acting director. Sirce Owen, the
current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued
a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for
nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to
people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of
nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. </p>
<p>The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and
shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered
agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet
gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of
thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a
year on the job.</p>

East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed
round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the
Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the
Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were
under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather
Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up
to 20.3 centimeters of rain.</p>
<p>Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in
Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.</p>
<p>“We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have
flooded in the past,” Beshear said on social media.</p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars
and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan
County, Virginia, where the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides.</p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook.</p>
<p>Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings
were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service called the expected rain a “major,
potentially historic, flash flood event.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest
accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in
upstate New York and portions of northern New England.</p>
<p>“Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are
forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy
icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,”
the weather service warned.</p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of
Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those
states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted
throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday
evening.</p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those
living on the streets.</p>
<p>Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just
north of Denver.</p>
<p>The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains
over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree
Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western
Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota.
People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to
shelter livestock and other animals.</p>
<p>California struggles with mudslides</p>
<p>Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm
of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on
wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike
even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps
keep soil anchored has burned away.</p>
<p>Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of
Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and
damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up
mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.</p>
<p>A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours.
Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche
during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a
Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>

to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off
thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according
to two sources familiar with the agency’s plans, and the cuts could
happen as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the
size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to
lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil
service protection.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.</p>
<p>Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to
almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to
quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was
Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be
able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until
Sept. 30.</p>
<p>However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they
will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump
administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a
letter sent recently to IRS employees.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff
announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did
not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.</p>
<p>Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the
IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April
15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS
through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats’ Inflation
Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new
employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new
technology to update the tax collection agency.</p>
<p>Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and
billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have
called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal
government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure
its priorities.</p>
<p>Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys
general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access
sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a
lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions
taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and
Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that
delineate the powers of Congress and the president.</p>
