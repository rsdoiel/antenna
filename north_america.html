America’s Strictest Wildfire Code</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Here’s a grim fact: The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-you-need-to-know-la-fires" target="_self"><u>most
destructive fires</u></a> in recent American history swept over a state
with the country’s strictest wildfire-specific building code, including
in some of the neighborhoods that are
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/03beab8511814e79a0e4eabf0d3e7247/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
largely smoldering rubble</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
California’s wildfire building code, Chapter 7A, went into effect in
2008, and it mandates fire-resistant siding, tempered glass, vegetation
management, and vents for attics and crawlspaces designed to resist
embers and flames. The code is the “most robust” in the nation, Lisa
Dale, a lecturer at the Columbia Climate School and a former
environmental policy advisor for the State of Colorado, told me. It
applies to nearly any newly built structure in one of the zones mapped
out by state and local officials as especially prone to fire hazard.
</p>
<p>
The adoption of 7A followed years of code development and mapping of
hazardous areas, largely in response to devastating urban wildfires such
as the Tunnel Fire, which claimed more than 3,000 structures and 25
lives in Oakland and Berkeley in 1991, and kicked off renewed efforts to
harden Californian homes.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s report on the 1991 fire makes
for
<a href="https://www.caloes.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Fire-Rescue/Documents/US-Fire-Admin-East-Bay-Hills-Fire-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><u>familiar
reading</u></a> as the Palisades and Eaton fires still smolder. The
wildland-urban interface, it says, was put at extreme risk by a
combination of dry air, little rainfall, hot winds blowing east to west,
built-up vegetation that was too close to homes, steep hills, and
limited access to municipal water. The report also castigates the
“unregulated use of wood shingles as roof and siding material.”
</p>
<p>
This was not the first time a destructive fire on the wildland-urban
interface had been partially attributed to ignitable building materials.
The 1961 Bel-Air fire, for instance, which claimed almost 200 homes,
including that of Burt Lancaster, and the 1959 Laurel Canyon fire were
both, FEMA said, evidence of “the wood roof and separation from natural
fuels problems,” as were fires in 1970 and 1980 near where the Tunnel
Fire eventually struck in 1970 and 1980.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But it was the sheer scale of the Tunnel Fire that prompted
action by California lawmakers.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the 1990s, fire-resilient roofing requirements were ramped
up, designating which materials were allowed in fire hazard areas and
throughout the state. By all accounts, the building code works — but
only when and where it’s in force. Dale told me that compliant homes
were
<a href="https://headwaterseconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/HE_2023_Missing-the-Mark-Wildfire.pdf" target="_blank"><u>five
times as likely to survive a wildfire</u></a>.
<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29621/w29621.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Research</u></a>
by economists Judson Boomhower and Patrick Baylis found that the code
“reduced average structure loss risk during a wildfire by 16 percentage
points, or about a 40% reduction.”
</p>
<p>
“The challenge from the perspective of wildfire vulnerability is that
those codes are relatively recent, and the housing stock turns over
really slowly, so we have this enormous stock of already built homes in
dangerous places that are going to be out there for decades,” Boomhower
told me.
</p>
<p>
The 7A building code applies only to new buildings, however. In
long-settled areas of California like Pacific Palisades, which has
little new housing construction or even existing home turnover due to
high costs and permitting complications, especially in areas under the
jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission, many houses are not
just failing to comply with Chapter 7A, but also with any housing code
at all.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Looking at which homes had survived past fires, Steve
Quarles, who helped advise the California State Fire Marshal on
developing 7A, told me, “What really mattered was if it was built under
<em><em>any</em></em> building code.” Many homes destroyed by the fires
in Los Angeles likely were not. In Pacific Palisades, fire management is
a frequent topic of
<a href="https://edlenteam.com/new-wildfire-disclosure-report/" target="_blank"><u>concern
and discussion</u></a>. But as late as 2018, local media in Pacific
Palisades noted that the area
<a href="https://palisadesnews.com/the-right-roof-in-pacific-palisades-is-important-for-fire-safety/" target="_blank"><u>still
had some homes with wood shingle roofs</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While a complete inventory of homes lost in the Palisades
and Eaton fires has yet to be taken, the neighborhoods were full of
older homes. According to CalFire incident reports, of the almost 47,000
structures in the zone of the Palisades Fire, more than 8,000 were built
before 1939, and 44,560 were built before 2009. For the Eaton Fire area,
of the around 41,000 structures, almost 14,000 were built before 1939,
and only around 1,000 were built since 2010.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>A Pacific Palisades home designed by architect Greg Chasen
and built in 2024, however, survived the fire and went viral on X after
he posted a photo of it still standing after the flames had moved
through. The home embodied some of the best practices for fire-safe
building,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-13/los-angeles-wildfires-why-these-homes-didn-t-burn" target="_blank"><u>according
to </u><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>, including
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-zone-zero" target="_self"><u>keeping
vegetation away from the building</u></a>, a metal roof, tempered glass,
and fire-resistant siding.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>When Michael Wara, the director of Stanford University’s
Climate and Energy Policy Program,
<a href="https://woodsinstitute.stanford.edu/system/files/publications/New_Strategy_Wildfire_Epidemic_Whitepaper_1.pdf" target="_blank"><u>spoke
with firefighters and insurance industry officials</u></a> in the
process of drafting a 2021 report for the Stanford Woods Institute for
the Environment on strategies for mitigating wildfire risk, they told
him that, from their perspective, wildfires are often a matter of “home
ignition,” meaning that while building near forested areas puts any home
at risk, the risk of a home itself igniting varies based on how it’s
built and the vegetation clearance around it. “Existing homes in high
fire threat areas” built before the implementation of California’s
wildfire building codes, Wara wrote, “are a massive problem.” At the
time he published the paper, there were somewhere between 700,000 and
1.3 million pre-building code homes still standing in “high or very high
threat areas.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The flipside of focusing on “home ignition” and the
building code is that the building code works better over time, as more
and more homes comply with it thanks to normal turnover, people
extensively renovating, or even tearing down old homes — or rebuilding
after fires. Homes that are close to homes that don’t ignite in a fire
are more likely to survive.
</p>
<p>
<span></span><a href="https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-021-00117-0" target="_blank"><u>One
study</u></a> that looked at the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed more
than 18,000 structures and claimed more than 80 lives in the Northern
California town of Paradise, sampled homes built before 1997, between
1997 and 2018, and from 2018 onwards, and found that only 11.5% of
pre-1997 homes survived, compared to 38.5% from 1997 and after. The
researchers also found that building survivability had a kind of
magnifying effect, with distance from the nearest destroyed structure
and the number structures destroyed in the immediate area among “the
strongest predictors of survival.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“The more homes that comply, the less chance you get those
structural ignitions and the less chance you get those huge disasters
like this,” Doug Green, who manages Headwaters Economics’ Community
Assistance for Wildfire Program, told me. “It takes people doing the
right thing to their own home — dealing with vegetation, making sure
roofs are clean, having right roofing. It’s really a community-wide
strategy to stop fires that happen like this.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But just as any home hardening — or just building to code —
is more effective the more the homes around you do it as well, it’s just
as true in reverse. “If your next door neighbors don’t do that work, the
effectiveness of your efforts will be less,” Dale said. “Building codes
ultimately work best when we get an entire landscape or neighborhood to
adopt them.”

out of the University of California, Los Angeles, concludes that climate
change intensified the city’s devastating wildfires. The UCLA
researchers estimated that intense heat caused by climate change may be
linked to about 25% of the fuel that fed the fires. “We believe that the
fires would still have been extreme without the climate change
components,” the authors wrote, “but would have been somewhat smaller
and less intense.” This analysis is not peer reviewed, and the
scientists call for further research. But they add that future wildfire
mitigation should focus on “factors we can control,” like stopping
people from lighting fires, making homes fire-resistant, and thinking
more carefully about where we build.

to recent natural disasters like flooding in North Carolina and
wildfires in California. He touted his Inflation Reduction Act as “the
most significant climate and clean energy law ever, ever in the history
of the world,” and said we don’t have to choose between planet and
prosperity. But Biden had a warning. Without naming names, he said that
“powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate
the steps we’ve taken to tackle the climate crisis to serve their own
interests for power and profit.” He added: “We must not be bullied into

already have funding locked in and will therefore be able to stick
around for a few years. “The jobs survive, even if the branding

<li>Takeaways from DOE nominee Chris Wright’s confirmation hearing

<p>
Yesterday’s confirmation hearing for Chris Wright, a fracking executive
and Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Energy, proved to be
relatively low-key and collegial. Wright repeatedly avowed that climate
change is happening and is caused by the combustion of hydrocarbons,
although he demurred that it was a “global” problem and turned his
responses repeatedly to energy innovation and developing energy
resources in the United States. He lamented that fossil fuels had
“fallen out of fashion and out of favor,” but also expressed enthusiasm
for certain clean energy technologies, including next-generation
geothermal and nuclear power. “Wright’s relatively easy reception
reflects the fact that there actually are wide areas of bipartisan
agreement on the kind of energy research and technology development work
the Department of Energy does,”

Blue Origin reaches orbit in first New Glenn launch, misses booster
landing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Blue Origin’s giant New Glenn rocket
blasted off from Florida early Thursday morning on its first mission to
space, an inaugural step into Earth’s orbit for Jeff Bezos’ space
company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business.</p>
<p>Thirty stories tall with a reusable first stage, New Glenn launched
around 2 a.m. ET (0700 GMT) from Blue Origin’s launchpad at the Cape
Canaveral Space Force Station, its seven engines thundering for miles
under cloudy skies on its second liftoff attempt this week.</p>
<p>Hundreds of employees at the company’s Kent, Washington headquarters
and its Cape Canaveral, Florida rocket factory roared in applause as
Blue Origin VP Ariane Cornell announced the rocket’s second stage made
it to orbit, achieving a long-awaited milestone.</p>
<p>“We hit our key, critical, number-one objective, we got to orbit
safely,” Cornell said on a company live stream. “And y’all we did it on
our first go.”</p>
<p>The rocket’s reusable first stage booster was due to land on a barge
in the Atlantic Ocean after separating from its second stage, but failed
to make that landing, Cornell confirmed. Telemetry from the booster
blacked out minutes after liftoff.</p>
<p>“We did in fact lose the booster,” Cornell said.</p>
<p>The culmination of a decade-long, multi-billion-dollar development
journey, the mission marks Blue Origin’s first trek to Earth’s orbit in
the 25 years since Bezos founded the company.</p>
<p>Bezos told Reuters on Sunday, before Blue Origin’s first launch
attempt, that he was most nervous about landing the booster.</p>
<p>But he added that sticking the landing would be the “icing on the
cake” if they could achieve the milestone of getting the payload to its
intended orbit.</p>
<p>Secured inside New Glenn’s payload bay for the mission is the first
prototype of Blue Origin’s Blue Ring vehicle, a maneuverable spacecraft
the company plans to sell to the Pentagon and commercial customers for
national security and satellite servicing missions.</p>
<p>The rocket’s first attempt to launch on Monday was scrubbed around 3
a.m. ET because ice had accumulated on a propellant line. On Thursday,
the company cited no issues ahead of launch.</p>
<p>Bezos monitored the launch from a few miles away in Blue Origin’s
mission control room, wearing a large headset and flanked by dozens of
launch staff. The company’s CEO, Dave Limp, was next to him.</p>
<p>New Glenn is expected to press ahead with a backlog of dozens of
missions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including up to 27
launches for Amazon’s Kuiper satellite internet network that will rival
SpaceX’s Starlink service.</p>
<p>New Glenn is the latest U.S. rocket to debut in recent years as
governments and private companies beef up their space programs and race
to challenge Elon Musk’s SpaceX and its workhorse Falcon 9.</p>
<p>NASA’s giant Space Launch System rocket had a successful debut in
2022, as did the Vulcan rocket last year from United Launch Alliance,
Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s joint launch venture.</p>
<p>New Glenn is roughly twice as powerful as Falcon 9, the world’s most
active rocket, with a payload bay diameter two times larger to fit
bigger batches of satellites. Blue Origin has not disclosed the rocket’s
launch pricing. Falcon 9 starts at around $62 million.</p>
<p>The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and
faced numerous delays as SpaceX grew into an industry juggernaut.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s giant, next-generation Starship rocket in development, which
New Glenn will also compete with, is expected to further rattle the
industry with cheap rides to space and full reusability.</p>
<p>Bezos in late 2023 moved to speed things up at Blue Origin,
prioritizing the development of New Glenn and its BE-4 engines. He named
Limp, an Amazon veteran, as CEO, who employees say introduced a sense of
urgency to compete with SpaceX.</p>

windy weather to ease as firefighters battle LA wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Southern California firefighters made some progress in containing two
major wildfires, while forecasters said weather conditions in the coming
days could bring welcome relief from the days of dry air and high winds
that have plagued the region.</p>
<p>The relief will give firefighters a key window to battle the
Palisades Fire on the west edge of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the
foothills east of the city before another potential turn to dangerous
conditions next week.</p>
<p>“Good news: We are expecting a much-needed break from the fire
weather concerns to close this week,” the National Weather Service said
Wednesday. “Bad News: Next week is a concern. While confident that we
will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions
are expected.”</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire was 21% contained late Wednesday after burning 96
square kilometers, according to the California Department of Foresty and
Fire Protection. The agency said the Eaton Fire was 45% contained and
had burned 57 square kilometers.</p>
<p>More than 82,000 people were under evacuation orders, while 8,500
firefighters from the United States, Canada and Mexico were battling the
two fires and several smaller ones in the region.</p>
<p>The fires have killed at least 25 people and burned 12,000 homes and
other structures, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The wildfires ignited Jan. 7, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds in a
region that has been largely without rain for eight months. Weather
forecasts show little to no chance of rain in the next week.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

and foreign dignitaries to attend Trump’s inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will be among several
billionaires attending Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration.
Tesla CEO Musk was instrumental in Trump’s reelection with his
contribution of over a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump’s campaign
coffers, according to Forbes. Musk is set to head Trump’s new Department
of Government Efficiency, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Reports say that Musk is slated to be seated at the inauguration with
fellow billionaires Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>While it is not customary to invite foreign leaders, Trump has
invited several. Argentinian President Javier Milei is expected to
attend, according to Bloomberg. Milei was the first foreign leader to
meet with Trump after he won November’s election. Trump has also invited
Chinese President Xi Jinping who is sending an envoy. Far-right Italian
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also received an invitation, but she
has said she is not sure her schedule will allow her to attend.</p>
<p>It is customary for all the living presidents to attend the
inauguration. Outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden
will attend Monday’s ceremony. When Biden was sworn in four years ago,
following Trump’s losing reelection bid, Trump did not attend because he
held on to the belief that he had won the election.</p>
<p>Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will
also attend Trump’s inauguration. Bush and Clinton are set to be there
with their wives, Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton.</p>
<p>“Former first lady Michelle Obama will not attend the upcoming
inauguration,” the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama said in a
statement. It will be the second time in recent weeks, following her
absence at President Jimmy Carter’s funeral, that she has not attended a
public ceremony with other former presidents and their wives.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman
Douglas Emhoff, are also expected to be at the ceremony Monday. Harris
was the Democratic candidate in last year’s presidential election.</p>

begins freeing prisoners after US says it will lift terror
designation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HAVANA — Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of
talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden’s administration
announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation
as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes — and
some of them were arrested after taking part in historic 2021 protests —
were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following
the cases of detainees in the island.</p>
<p>Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista, 24,
who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in
prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison
in the province of Camagüey and told The Associated Press that eight men
were freed along with her.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it notified Congress of its
intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by
the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden’s
administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said.</p>
<p>Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed
Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities
explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.</p>
<p>Havana did not link the prisoners’ release to the U.S. decision on
lifting the designation but said it was “in the spirit of the Ordinary
Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,” referring to the
Vatican’s once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the
Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.</p>
<p>The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said
that by 4 p.m. EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto
Batista.</p>
<p>“At three in the morning they knocked,” Barreto Batista told the AP
over the phone. “I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather
all my things, that I was free.”</p>
<p>She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon
or a forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could
be sent back to prison.</p>
<p>“I am at home with my mother,” she said. “The whole family is
celebrating.”</p>
<p>In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest
widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis.
The government’s crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests
and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials
blamed U.S. sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest.</p>
<p>In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J,
said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the
protests.</p>
<p>Biden’s intention to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state
sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week
after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of
State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America’s top
diplomat.</p>
<p>Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist
revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent
of sanctions on the communist island.</p>

speaker removes chairman of House Intelligence Committee</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday removed the
Republican chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, who
was a vocal supporter of assistance for Ukraine and held other views
that put him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Johnson told reporters late Wednesday that Representative Mike
Turner, an Ohio Republican, would no longer lead the committee, which
oversees the nation’s intelligence agencies and holds tremendous
influence over law enforcement and foreign policy. Johnson last year
also gave two Trump allies highly sought spots on the panel.</p>
<p>Johnson said he made the decision to remove Turner because the
“intelligence community and everything related to (the committee) needs
a fresh start.”</p>
<p>The Republican speaker, who has aligned himself closely with Trump,
said he would soon announce the new chairperson for the committee.</p>
<p>Johnson went on to praise Turner and say he would play an important
role in working with NATO.</p>
<p>Turner’s stances on foreign policy had run afoul of the incoming
president, who will take the White House next week with a vision of
reshaping the federal government’s intelligence and law enforcement
capabilities.</p>
<p>Turner last year also pushed back on Trump’s false claims that
Haitian migrants in his Ohio district were eating pets.</p>
<p>His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

id="trumps-pick-to-lead-cia-promises-more-focus-firmer-posture">Trump’s
pick to lead CIA promises more focus, firmer posture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA
signaled substantial changes are in store for America’s premier spy
agency, telling lawmakers that it must be more aggressive both in
collecting intelligence and pushing back against Washington’s
adversaries.</p>
<p>John Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence at
the end of Trump’s first term, told the Senate Intelligence Committee
during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the CIA’s human
intelligence collection capability “isn’t where it needs to be.”</p>
<p>“We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in
every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,” Ratcliffe
said of his plans for the spy agency, should he be confirmed.</p>
<p>“We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president,
going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,” he
added.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe promised the CIA would deliver insights and information
free of personal and political bias, and said that if confirmed, he
would hold accountable employees and analysts who fail to perform up to
standard and eliminate programs that shift focus from the CIA’s key
responsibilities.</p>
<p>“If you have a politically motivated, bureaucratically imposed social
justice agenda that takes up part of your attention, that can distract
from the core mission of collecting human intelligence that matter and
providing it to you in a timely way,” he said.</p>
<p>“To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this
sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make
a difference,” Ratcliffe said. “If it doesn’t, then it’s time to find a
new line of work.”</p>
<p>Republican approval</p>
<p>Ratcliffe’s comments were met with approval from Senate Intelligence
Committee Republicans, who praised his experience and his plans to
refocus the CIA.</p>
<p>“The CIA needs to get back to its roots,” said committee chairman Tom
Cotton. “Stealing secrets.”</p>
<p>“The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,” Cotton said,
calling Ratcliffe the right man for the job.</p>
<p>“I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that
kind of agency. They joined the CIA after all, not a church choir or a
therapy session,” he added.</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee were, at times, more skeptical, asking
Ratcliffe for assurances that officers and analysts will not be
subjected to political loyalty tests.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ratcliffe today is your opportunity to reassure the men and
women of the CIA that they [need] not fear reprisal for speaking truth
to power — the most critical role of the IC [intelligence community],”
said Democrat Mark Warner, the committee’s vice chair.</p>
<p>“I need your commitment that you will not fire or force out CIA
employees because of their perceived political views, and that you will
not ask these employees to place loyalty to a political figure above
loyalty to country,” he said.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe responded, assuring lawmakers that he would not oversee a
purge of the agency.</p>
<p>CIA role</p>
<p>“If you look at my record, and my record as DNI, that never took
place,” Ratcliffe said. “That’s not something anyone has alleged and
something I would ever do.”</p>
<p>Other lawmakers raised concerns about Trump’s history of mistrust of
the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, fueled in part by U.S.
intelligence assessments that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016
U.S. presidential election to help Trump win.</p>
<p>“It seems to me you have an initial task that’s a little unusual but
also very important, and that is to restore the confidence of the
president-elect in the intelligence community,” said Senator Angus King,
an independent.</p>
<p>“You need to get him to a place where he does have confidence in the
judgments that are coming to him,” King added.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe said that was likely why he was chosen to lead the CIA.</p>
<p>“I think one of the reasons I have this opportunity for you all to
consider me for confirmation is because President Trump knows and wants
me to lead with integrity,” he told the committee.</p>
<p>Still, some former U.S. intelligence officials have taken a dim view
of Ratcliffe’s qualifications to lead the spy agency despite his time as
the nation’s top intelligence official.</p>
<p>Lingering doubts</p>
<p>“As DNI, Ratcliffe repeatedly demonstrated that his first priority
was to advance Donald Trump’s political interests rather than to
function as an apolitical intelligence chief,” said Paul Pillar, a
former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>As examples, Pillar pointed to Ratcliffe’s decision to release a
Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations
about nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Pillar also noted that Ratcliffe also shunned transparency, refusing
to attend Congress’ annual worldwide threats hearing “because the
previous year’s assessment reported facts that Trump didn’t like.”</p>
<p>“To politicize the role of CIA director in a similar manner is just
as damaging to the proper role of intelligence as politicizing the role
of DNI,” Pillar told VOA. “There is no reason to expect Ratcliffe to
perform any differently in this respect in the CIA job than he did as
DNI.”</p>
<p>But other former officials saw Ratcliffe’s performance during the
hearing Wednesday as a positive step.</p>
<p>“Ratcliffe performed well and should rightly obtain an easy
confirmation,” said Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and
former senior director of the White House Situation Room.</p>
<p>“He said all the right things about the importance of analytic and
operational integrity and about the technical challenges facing CIA
today,” Pfeiffer told VOA. “More importantly, he offered assurances he
would assiduously avoid and counter politicization of the agency. … This
will be reassuring to anyone inside CIA today who is nervous about the
incoming Trump administration.”</p>
<p>Top threats</p>
<p>Ratcliffe told lawmakers the list of threats and challenges facing
the United States is long, topped by an ever more aggressive China that
is “committed to dominating the world economically, militarily and
technologically.”</p>
<p>He also cited threats from transnational criminal organizations and
drug cartels, Iran and its proxies, North Korea and multiple terror
groups.</p>
<p>And he acknowledged the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, spreading devastation and
increasing the risk of the United States being pulled into a conflict
with a nuclear power,” Ratcliffe warned.</p>
<p>But he also said that Russia, unlike China, is unable to confront the
U.S. across multiple domains at once.</p>
<p>Russia “falls into that category” of “countries that can’t compete
with the United States in terms of kinetic firepower across the board,”
Ratcliffe said.</p>
<p>“The Russians have to decide where they’re going to compete,” he
said, noting that Moscow has chosen areas like hypersonic missile
technology at the expense of overall troop readiness.</p>
<p>Ratcliffe further promised lawmakers he would ensure the CIA seeks
answers to the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of
brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck
hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials.</p>
<p>And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance
authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act, or FISA, calling it an indispensable tool, going as far to reject
calls to require a warrant before accessing certain communications or
data — a view that conflicts with positions previously espoused by other
Trump nominees.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need to share your experience and your wisdom with
the nominees for FBI and director of national security,” Republican
Senator John Cornyn told Ratcliffe, “because we’ve had these
conversations as well, and I think there’s some confusion.”</p>

<h2 id="what-if-kathy-hochul-is-violating-new-yorks-climate-law">What If
Kathy Hochul Is Violating New York’s Climate Law?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYxNTI3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzM4MTY1MX0.bwXmpLXK1Kd2bQ_T8J6NNeOtQS1II8OF3x1WaWVHhpE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When New York Governor Kathy Hochul gave her State of the State address
on Tuesday, climate advocates expected her to unveil an overdue plan to
implement and fund the state’s climate law, which was enacted in 2019.
Instead, she implied that she was delaying the plan indefinitely. In
doing so,
<a href="https://x.com/MichaelGerrard/status/1879274367039033716" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>legal
experts say Hochul would be breaking the law</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
New York has a statutory requirement to cut emissions 40% from 1990
levels by 2030, and 85% by 2050. The deadline to draw up regulations to
achieve this passed in January 2024. Hochul’s administration has been
working on a solution — a
<a href="https://capandinvest.ny.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cap
and invest</u></a> program, which would set a limit on total greenhouse
gas emissions from the state that would decline over time and put a
price on those emissions, bringing in revenue that could be reinvested
in carbon reduction projects. The state expects decarbonization to cost
$15 billion per year by 2030, and $45 billion in 2050.
</p>
<p>
As recently as a few weeks ago, New York climate advocates were hearing
that Hochul planned to preview the program in her State of the State
address before including it in her proposed budget. “All indications
were that this was all systems go,” Justin Balik, the senior state
program director for Evergreen Action, told me.
</p>
<p>
But Hochul didn’t mention cap and invest once in her speech. Her
<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/2025StateoftheStateBook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State
of the State policy book</u></a>, published Tuesday, acknowledges the
program and notes that in the coming months, her administration will
propose new emissions <em><em>reporting</em></em> regulations “while
creating more space and time for public transparency and a robust
investment planning process.” Advocates interpreted the message as a
kiss-off.
</p>
<p>
“There have to be enforceable regulations that ensure we can meet the
emission reduction mandates,” Rachel Spector, a senior attorney at
Earthjustice, told me. “Those were supposed to be in place a year ago.
Now they are late and there’s no clear date when we are getting those
regulations, and that’s a really troubling situation.”

Governments miss statutory deadlines all the time. But without any clear
timeline on when the regulations might happen, the state’s overarching
climate law could become impossible to carry out. “We have a
[presidential] administration that’s coming in that’s extremely hostile
to moving forward on climate mitigation, and is going to potentially
take us backwards,” Balik told me. “And so we need states to be the
bulwark like they were during the last Trump term.”
</p>
<p>
There are a few possibilities for what can happen next.
</p>
<p>
Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change at
Columbia University, likened the situation to when Hochul tried to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>impose
an indefinite delay</u></a> on congestion pricing in New York City last
June, just days before it was set to go into effect. “I helped
coordinate an effort that led to two lawsuits in New York state court
claiming that Hochul did not have the power to do that,” he told me in
an email. “We won the lawsuits, congestion pricing survived several
lawsuits against it, and it launched on January 5.”
</p>
<p>
Gerrard added that some of the groups involved in those suits and others
are now considering challenging Hochul’s indefinite delay of cap and
invest. The text of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act,
which created the emissions targets, “allows citizens to bring
proceedings in state court for violations of the statute,” he said. And
there does not appear to be any pathway for achieving the targets
without cap and invest, he added.
</p>
<p>
Liz Moran, a policy advocate for Earthjustice, said that cap and invest
was never going to be enough anyway, and is urging the legislature to
make progress on sector-specific policies. She called for the state
assembly to pass the New York Heat Act, for instance, a bill that would
remove barriers to transitioning away from the use of natural gas for
home heating and set in motion a plan for mass conversion to efficient
electric heating.
</p>
<p>
Early outlines of New York’s cap and invest program indicate that
regulators were considering a relatively low price ceiling on pollution,
making it easier for companies to buy their way out of compliance with
the cap. As <em><em>New York Focus</em></em> has
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/12/23/greenhouse-emissions-new-york-cap-and-trade" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
the state’s own
<a href="https://capandinvest.ny.gov/-/media/Project/CapInvest/Files/2024-01-26-NYCI-Preproposal-Analysis-Webinar.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeling</u></a>
shows that the program alone would not achieve the 2030 target. “Given
what the governor has outlined as the ambition of the cap and invest
program, there was always going to need to be additional sectoral
mandates or policies that come from the legislature to drive emission
reductions,” Moran told me.
</p>
<p>
In theory, the legislature could also put forward a bill outlining its
own cap and invest program. Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, from Ithaca, New
York,
<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Anna-R-Kelles/story/110444" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced
a cap and invest bill</u></a> last year, though it never left the
environmental conservation committee.
</p>
<p>
Hochul spoke at length in her speech about affordability, and her
stalling of cap and invest may be related to concerns that it would
raise costs for consumers — or at least the perception that it would.
“New York needs to get the transition right and keep our state
affordable for families,” her policy book says. This would not be the
first time Hochul’s fears about the cost of climate action (and
potential backlash to it) have caused her to do an about-face. In 2023,
Hochul
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/gwp-global-warming-potential-new-york" target="_self"><u>tried
to change the way the state accounted for greenhouse gas
emissions</u></a> under the idea that it would lower the cost of
decarbonization. Her backpedaling on congestion pricing is another
example.
</p>
<p>
The state’s own analysis, however, found that cap and invest would
likely raise costs slightly for some New Yorkers while lowering them for
others. Low-income residents would be eligible for direct rebates that
would more than offset the higher cost of fuel. Depending on how the
remaining revenue is spent, it could
<a href="https://www.switch.box/nyci" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bring
further cost reductions</u></a> by helping New Yorkers pay for energy
efficiency improvements that lower their bills.
</p>
<p>
“The governor is rightly focused on affordability, which is why
extensive consumer rebates were baked into this,” said Balik. “From our
perspective, the way that the state was planning on moving forward with
this was perfectly in line with the governor’s affordability agenda.”
</p>
<p>
The one bit of climate action Hochul did commit to on Tuesday was to
call for spending $1 billion of the next budget on climate action — the
“largest climate investment in the history of the state budget” — though
she did not say where the money would come from or where it would go.
Her State of the State book gives little more detail, noting only that
it will “span different sectors of our economy and across the state’s
geography,” with nods to clean heating and transportation projects. Cap
and invest, meanwhile, is expected to bring in $3 billion to $5 billion
in its first year.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a start,” Spector said of the $1 billion. “But it’s definitely not
enough.”

id="scoop-the-draft-order-that-offshore-wind-opponents-sent-to-trump">Scoop:
The Draft Order that Offshore Wind Opponents Sent to Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYzMDU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Nzg3NzM3Nn0.r7dEjhffh9Umab6QopWDGdoKQZbVpKj-vSiM7y4Mb8I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Major groups in the anti-offshore wind movement are going big,
submitting a lengthy policy wish list to the Trump transition team,
according to documents obtained and first reported by Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
Key organizations in the movement against offshore wind submitted a
draft executive order “on the suspension of offshore wind development”
to the transition team. According to the draft, not only are activists
asking for a pause on new permits for offshore wind but also for a
stop-work order on all projects currently under construction. They’re
also asking for the Health and Human Services Department to become a
weapon against the growth of renewable energy, requesting studies into
the health and environmental effects of wind turbines and transmission
cables.
</p>
<p>
If the Trump team follows through on even some of the ideas in the draft
executive order, it would be a huge win for a nascent anti-renewables
uprising in America. It would also be a harbinger of pain to come for
wind energy in America under Trump. At the very least, it shows
activists believe the next president has many powers at his disposal to
make offshore wind developers’ lives miserable.
</p>
<p>
Mandy Davis, president of REACT Alliance, told Heatmap it had submitted
the draft executive order to the transition team, and that REACT was the
primary group behind the document. Davis is also head of the National
Offshore-Wind Opposition Alliance, a new country-wide coalition of local
groups opposed to offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
Davis said the draft order demonstrates the myriad ways she thinks the
incoming administration can curtail wind development beyond a pause on
new permits. “Our role is going to be determined to a great degree by
what our new administration is doing,” she told Heatmap. “We also have
to be really, really cognizant of the fact that even though the federal
government is going to put major monkey wrenches in the works … it’s
going to take a while.”
</p>
<p>
We’re still watching and waiting to see if Trump follows through with
his promise to stop offshore wind in its tracks on Day 1. New Jersey
Republican congressman Jeff Van Drew
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/offshore-wind-ban-order" target="_self"><u>said
in a statement Monday</u></a> that Trump’s team is working with his
office to draft an order that “halt[s] offshore wind turbine activities”
on the East Coast and the “proposed order” is “expected to be finalized
within the first few months of the administration.”
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that Van Drew is one of the anti-offshore wind’s
<a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=479" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favorite
allies</u></a> in Congress. But it is unclear to what extent – if any –
that the activists’ draft executive order obtained by Heatmap is winding
up in the product Van Drew and his staff are working on with the Trump
team. Representatives for Van Drew’s office did not immediately respond
to a request for comment about the draft executive order.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to fathom the extent of damage even a work stoppage order
would have on the American offshore wind industry. Roughly 5.8 gigawatts
of electricity capacity are under construction offshore and more than 8
gigawatts of projects have been fully permitted but haven’t begun
construction, according to data shared with Heatmap News that was
compiled by Christian Roselund, a policy analyst seasoned in the
renewables industry. At least 10 gigawatts of additional capacity is
currently in the federal review process and would be stymied by a halt
at the permitting level. Taken together, the proposals in the draft
could take millions of homes’ worth of carbon-free electricity off the
table indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
A source within the offshore wind industry who requested anonymity to
speak candidly said, if enacted, the proposals in the draft executive
order would “lay off thousands of Americans” and potentially lead to
work stoppages in other links in the industry’s supply chain, like
shipyards in Louisiana and steel plants in the Midwest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s in the draft order? </strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition to pausing permits, the draft executive order calls on the
incoming administration to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Conduct a full-government review</strong> of all offshore wind
projects previously approved by the federal government “for
reconsideration” based on their impacts to national security, aviation
safety, grid stability, biodiversity, and a host of other factors.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Issue a “stop-work order” </strong>on all permitted offshore
wind projects in construction until that review is completed.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Instruct</strong> <strong>each branch of the military to
independently assess</strong> if offshore wind projects impact their
operations.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Require the Treasury Department to conduct rulemaking activity to
<strong>exclude offshore wind projects from any existing tax
credits</strong> possible under the Inflation Reduction Act “pending a
comprehensive review.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
Compel the Commerce, Energy, and Interior Departments to each
<strong>conduct studies evaluating the economic impacts</strong> of
offshore wind, and require the Energy and Transportation Departments to
<strong>suspend federal grants and loans</strong> to projects related to
offshore wind, including port upgrades and grid alterations.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Make the Justice Department <strong>“reevaluate its current defense of
lawsuits</strong> related to offshore wind projects” and direct the
agency “to<strong> pursue settlement discussions</strong> in cases where
it is legally and ethically appropriate.” (Note: This is something
consultants have previously advised developers could happen under
Trump.)<br/>
</li>
<li>
Get the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration to do a
“<strong>comprehensive overhaul” of its process for reviewing and
approving commercial activities</strong> within habitat for species
protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Order the Health and Human Services Department to <strong>commission a
study on the effects of electromagnetic fields, infrasound and plastic
pollution</strong> from offshore wind projects on human and animal
health, as well as the safety of commercial seafood. It calls for a
separate HHS <strong>study into the impacts of bisphenol A, or
BPA,</strong> that activists claim they fear could leach from offshore
wind turbine components into the ocean.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Request for an Office of Management and Budget <strong>audit of any and
all federal funding to universities and research institutions</strong>
related to offshore wind.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to emails and other documents reviewed by Heatmap, the draft
executive order also involved the work of Lisa Quattrocki Knight,
president of the Rhode Island anti-offshore wind organization Green
Oceans and a board member of the National Offshore-Wind Opposition
Alliance.
</p>
<p>
Along with the draft executive order, Heatmap obtained other documents
with Green Oceans’ letterhead addressed to the incoming administration,
calling on it to “justify removing all permitted wind farm projects off
the eastern coast of the U.S.” under multiple potential legal
authorities including the National Emergencies Act, the Defense
Production Act, and Federal Power Act.
</p>
<p>
Knight did not respond to requests for an interview. A spokesperson for
Green Oceans contacted by Heatmap confirmed the organization played a
role in crafting the draft executive order and provided a statement that
the “draft Executive Order was developed as part of our broader efforts
to provide science-based, actionable recommendations to decision-makers,
regardless of political affiliation.”
</p>
<p>
“We believe that meaningful environmental progress requires bipartisan
cooperation, and we remain committed to working with all leaders who
share our vision of a sustainable future,” the statement read.
</p>
<p>
The documents also show the draft was endorsed by key groups fighting
offshore wind in the New Jersey and New York region, including Protect
Our Coast Long Island and Save the East Coast, as well as local
opposition groups based on the West Coast and in New England. Many of
these organizations will be participating in

id="trumps-pick-for-top-diplomat-calls-for-ceasefire-in-russias-war-on-ukraine">Trump’s
pick for top diplomat calls for ceasefire in Russia’s war on
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Russia’s nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine has become a “war of
attrition” and a “stalemate” that must be ended, Senator Marco Rubio,
President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, told
senators at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rubio broke from the passive stance of the administration of outgoing
President Joe Biden, which has said it was up to Kyiv to decide under
what terms it would be open to peace talks with Moscow. In the meantime,
the U.S., along with its European allies, has continued to send billions
of dollars of armaments to Ukraine to continue the fight.</p>
<p>Rubio instead said the first step in ending the war should be a
ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year
mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. However, ongoing fighting is also
raging in Russia’s Kursk region, which Ukraine captured in August, even
as Moscow has attempted to retake it with the help of North Korean
troops.</p>
<p>Both countries also target each other daily with aerial strikes,
drones and missiles, with thousands of Ukrainian civilians killed in the
Russian attacks, along with vast numbers of both countries’ troops.</p>
<p>“This war has to end,” he said at his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine “extraordinary,” saying it
will “take a generation to rebuild.”</p>
<p>But even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting
that started with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was
unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines.
Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized
Ukrainian land mass.</p>
<p>“The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way
Russia takes all of Ukraine,” Rubio said. “It’s also unrealistic to
believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine, no matter how
incompetent and no matter how much damage the Russian Federation has
suffered as a result of this invasion, there’s no way Ukraine is also
going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the
eve of the invasion.”</p>
<p>Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice
their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important
to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow.</p>
<p>But Rubio said that one of Ukraine’s key problems was not a shortage
of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough
troops.</p>
<p>“The problem that Ukraine is facing is not that they’re running out
of money, [it] is that they’re running out of Ukrainians,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for
Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war before he assumed
the presidency on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the
war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the
end of April.</p>
<p>On the battlefront, officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday that
a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the
Lviv region, part of a series of attacks that President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy said included more than 40 missiles and 70 drones.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Russia’s targets included “gas and energy facilities
that sustain normal life for our people,” but that Ukrainian air
defenses shot down 30 of the missiles.</p>
<p>“Thanks to our air defense forces and all involved units, we’ve
managed to maintain the functionality of our energy system,” Zelenskyy
said. “However, we must continue strengthening the capabilities of
Ukraine’s air shield. Promises made by partners at the NATO summit in
Washington and within the Ramstein format still remain partially
unfulfilled.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country
Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts
in six regions.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces
attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from
destroyed drones damaging two houses.</p>
<p>In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that
Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an
industrial site.</p>
<p>Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he
described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several
residential buildings.</p>
<p>Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the
area overnight.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over
the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region.</p>
<p>Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian
attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov

<h2 id="takeaways-from-chris-wrights-confirmation-hearing">3 Takeaways
From Chris Wright’s Confirmation Hearing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTYyMzgwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzM5MDAxNn0.d_k0kNt4xy3tl5hB4LzgxI0-lZjvBA9AO4fOtNFUtm0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
With Donald Trump due to take office in less than a week and a
Republican Congress already sworn in, much of the Biden administration’s
effort to advance clean and especially renewable energy is now in doubt.
The fate of the Inflation Reduction Act is likely to be a major
flashpoint — and yet the confirmation hearing for Chris Wright, a
literal fracking executive, for Secretary of Energy proved to be
relatively low-key and collegial among senators from both parties.
</p>
<p>
Here are three takeaways from the day’s proceedings:
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wright is essentially a shoo-in for the job</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright is not one of Trump’s more controversial nominees, so it’s no
surprise that his hearing went smoothly — and that Wright was introduced
by his fellow Coloradan, Democratic Senator
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/qa/senator-john-hickenlooper-permitting-reform-ira" target="_self"><u>John
Hickenlooper</u></a>, was an early strong signal that will likely pass
through confirmation with ease. To the extent there were any fireworks,
they came not from the legislators on the dais but rather from several
quickly muffled protests in the hearing room. One protester shouted,
“I’m 18 years old and I want a future!” before being removed, while
another one yelled, “Will your fracking liquid put out fires in L.A.?”
</p>
<p>
The questioning before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources was a mix of parochial concerns from senators about their own
states — the committee’s ranking Democrat, Martin Heinrich, for
instance, asked if Wright would visit Sandia and Los Alamos National
Laboratories, located in his home state of New Mexico, while
Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick, a Republican, asked about the
prospects of a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say climate change didn’t come up. Wright repeatedly
avowed that climate change is happening and is caused by the combustion
of hydrocarbons, although he demurred that it was a “global” problem and
turned his responses repeatedly to developing energy resources in the
United States.
</p>
<p>
“If you shut down industry, those emissions don’t go away, they go
somewhere else,” Wright claimed. “The only pathway to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and improve quality of life is energy innovation.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Everyone in the room could agree on geothermal (and nuclear)</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright generally stayed away from specifics on spending levels or
individual programs, aside from expressing generalized enthusiasm for
the Department of Energy’s network of national laboratories and the
importance of its work maintaining the nuclear stockpile. In his opening
statement, he identified one of his goals as to “unleash American energy
at home and abroad to restore energy dominance.”
</p>
<p>
Over the course of the hearing, what he meant became at least marginally
clearer. Under questioning from McCormick about the Department’s Office
of Fossil Energy — renamed the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon
Management under outgoing President Joe Biden and Energy Secretary
Jennifer Granholm — Wright lamented that fossil fuel had “fallen out of
fashion and out of favor. There’s less interest in investing in it and
less interest in talking about it,” he said, before declaring, “I don’t
share that aversion.”
</p>
<p>
He did, however, expressed enthusiasm for certain clean energy
technologies, including next-generation geothermal (“It’s an enormous,
abundant energy resource below our feet”) and nuclear power. He also
went along with Democratic senators who asked about reforms to existing
federal permitting regulations to facilitate the buildout of
long-distance energy transmission, a focus of the last Congress’s failed
permitting reform bill and a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-manchin-barrasso-westerman" target="_self"><u>key
precursor</u></a> to cleaning up the grid. (Nuclear and geothermal are
also two areas where Wright’s company, Liberty Energy, has investments.)
</p>
<p>
To the extent Wright was willing to talk about solar — there was barely
any mention of wind in the entire hearing — he had to be prodded by
Democrats in sun-rich states, such as Heinrich and Nevada’s Catherine
Cortez Masto. Wright also called into question some estimates of how
cheap renewables are, arguing that a popular measure for comparing
energy resources with each other, the levelized cost of energy, “misses
the boat on electricity generation because it’s like, would you take
Uber that was 10% cheaper in cost if you didn’t know when the Uber would
pick you up or where it would drop you off?” essentially arguing that
the low price of energy generated by renewables doesn’t take into
account their unavailability during certain times of day or in certain
weather conditions.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It’s hard to dislike an Energy Secretary</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Wright’s relatively easy reception reflects the fact that there actually
are wide areas of bipartisan agreement on the kind of energy research
and technology development work the Department of Energy does. Members
on both sides of the aisle saw their enthusiasm for nuclear power —
especially small modular reactors — reflected back by Wright, with
Arizona Democrat Ruben Gallego saying “I appreciate your enthusiasm for
nuclear energy.”
</p>
<p>
The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is also stocked with Senators
who represent states where the DOE has a substantial presence, including
New Mexico, California, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, and Washington, which can
lead to more collegial hearings if the nominee, as Wright does, affirms
the importance and value of the Department’s national laboratories.
Agencies that spend money broadly across the country tend to be popular
with lawmakers.
</p>
<p>
But Wright is just the first nominee for a major energy and environment
related post to face the Senate. Other nominees, including Doug Burgum
for Secretary of the Interior and Lee Zeldin for Environmental
Protection Agency administrator, may endure more contentious hearings,
as they will likely face questions on issues that are sharply divisive,
like opening up public lands for fossil fuel extraction and rules on
power plant and tailpipe emissions.

Is Giving Cash to L.A. Fire Victims, No Questions Asked</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU5MDcyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzQ0MjUxNH0.NXYDaw2rEkIWsQRjUmwF5z3PKPrM5chSQhy9oiG6_DU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Whether they’re dealing with fires like the ones ravaging Los Angeles or
hurricanes like those that wreaked havoc in Florida and North Carolina
just a few months ago, when natural disasters lay waste to homes and
towns, what low-income residents often need most is quick cash. That,
however, can be difficult to come by. Insurance companies can take
months or even years to fully resolve claims. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency requires significant documentation before it will
offer relief, and often
<a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2025/01/10/getting-aid-for-fire-damage-calls-for-patience-federal-official-says/" target="_blank"><u>denies
victims</u></a> with no explanation.
</p>
<p>
The nonprofit GiveDirectly is trying to circumvent all this maddening
complexity, working with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/q-and-a-google-maps-yael-maguire" target="_self"><u>Google</u></a>
to overlay government data on things like median income and food stamp
enrollment with damage data gleaned from satellite imagery and local
incident reports to get cash in the hands of those who need it most —
quickly. After a disaster, low-income residents in especially hard-hit
areas are automatically deemed eligible for aid, no opt-in necessary.
They’ll get a notification on their phone that they qualify for a direct
cash transfer, and can enroll in a matter of minutes, with no additional
documentation required.
</p>
<p>
“Especially as disasters become more prevalent and more severe, having a
way to pre-verify vulnerable populations — to get people resources as
quickly as possible — becomes so valuable,” Laura Keen, GiveDirectly’s
U.S. program director, told me. As she explained, cash is often more
useful than “in kind” donations such as clothing or food, as it allows
recipients to prioritize specific needs and reduces barriers associated
with government-run disaster programs. “You have to have the means and
the know-how and the language abilities to apply for that assistance,”
Keen said. Still,
<a href="https://devinit.org/resources/falling-short-humanitarian-funding-reform/cash-voucher-assistance/#:~:text=Humanitarian%20CVA%20continued%20to%20grow,compared%20to%2022%25%20in%202022." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
75% of global humanitarian assistance</u></a> is in-kind.
</p>
<p>
GiveDirectly
<a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/lafires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
up its fundraising campaign</u></a> for L.A. fire victims on January 10,
and is thus far over 40% of the way to its $1 million dollar goal. While
the fundraiser won’t officially close for another 25 days, Keen said the
organization plans to send out its first payments “as soon as next
week.” While GiveDirectly has yet to finalize amounts, it estimates that
recipients will get on the order of $3,000 to $4,000 — significantly
more than the nonprofit gave to victims of Hurricane Ian in 2022 or
Hurricanes Helene and Milton last year. That’s because with these fires,
“the damage has been so severe, and we expect people are going to be
facing temporary housing costs for a matter of months,” Keen explained.
For a campaign like this, Keen said she expects about 88 cents out of
every dollar donated to go directly to affected individuals and
families, the same efficiency rate as the organization’s Helene and
Milton campaign. That remaining 12 cents will go towards transaction
fees, offices, and staff.
</p>
<p>
If these rapid payouts remind you of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-kettle-insurance" target="_self"><u>parametric
insurance</u></a>, you’re on the right track. Parametric insurance also
exists to get cash quickly into the hands of those who have experienced
disaster, without the need for damage audits. But as is implied by the
word “insurance,” it is also an opt-in service that involves the payment
of monthly premiums. GiveDirectly’s cash comes out of the blue, free and
clear.
</p>
<p>
To get the actual money out the door, GiveDirectly works with Propel, an
app for low-income households to manage government benefits such as SNAP
food stamps. GiveDirectly tells Propel what areas its mapping tool has
honed in on, and Propel sends out an alert to users in these zones,
notifying them that they’re eligible to receive money. Individuals then
complete a brief survey confirming their contact information, preferred
language, and signing some consent notices.
</p>
<p>
“The last response that we did in western North Carolina and in Florida
last fall, it took them, on average, 68 seconds to complete that
enrollment form,” Keen told me. The last time she looked at the data,
there were about 2,300 households using Propel in the impacted areas of
L.A., a number that’s only growing as the largest fires remain
uncontained. Once people enroll, they can expect to receive money
directly to their debit accounts within three days.
</p>
<p>
While quick and simple, this strategy is far from comprehensive. Only
about one in four households that receive SNAP benefits has the Propel
app. And those that do may not open it regularly, meaning they could
miss the alert that they qualify for cash. For Propel users who see the
notification, Keen said, enrollment is above 80%, while overall user
enrollment is much lower — around 40%. “But typically, we have more
Propel users than we have funds,” Keen explained. Basically, it wouldn’t
actually be possible to give the target amounts to everyone who meets
the criteria. Rather, the strategy is to get money out as quickly as
possible, knowing full well there’ll be many who are missed. Plus,
relying on Propel makes the whole system safe from fraud (something
GiveDirectly has
<a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/drc-case-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dealt
with in the past</u></a>), as Propel users have already verified their
eligibility for government benefits. “So we just have very high
confidence in who we’re supporting,” Keen told me.
</p>
<p>
Domestic disaster relief was not initially on the agenda for
GiveDirectly, which was started in 2008 by a group of econ grad students
at Harvard and MIT as a way to get money into the hands of some of the
poorest people in the developing world. Since the organization began
accepting public donations in 2011, it’s mostly retained this
international focus, making its first foray into domestic cash transfers
in 2017, when it provided physical debit cards to victims of Hurricane
Harvey in Texas.
</p>
<p>
“At that time, we had pretty rudimentary targeting,” Keen told me. “We
would just drive to different areas, talk with as many people as we
could, visually look for signs of damage, try to source any open source
information where we could, and then overlay that with administrative
data.” Since then, the company has integrated artificial intelligence
into its hurricane relief efforts, training algorithms to generate
damage assessments for thousands or even millions of structures. But
fire damage is much more uniform (if a house burns, it’s usually 100%
destroyed) and easy to identify from satellite imagery alone, Keen
explained.
</p>
<p>
If GiveDirectly exceeds its fundraising target in L.A., however, it may
run out of eligible residents who are reachable via the Propel app,
meaning the organization will need to go back to basics: establish an
in-person presence in the city., enroll people onsite, and hand out
debit cards once more. “Right now our goal is to get to $1 million, and
then all of that we can deliver via Propel,” Keen told me. “But if we
exceed that, we would definitely explore other options.”

imposes export controls on biotech equipment over AI security
concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would
implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing
national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data
science.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech
equipment’s technology to bolster its military capabilities and help
design new weapons using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The department said the technology has many applications, including
its ability to be used for “human performance enhancement, brain-machine
interfaces, biologically inspired synthetic materials and possibly
biological weapons.”</p>
<p>The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to
countries without a U.S. license, such as China.</p>
<p>The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass
spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can
“generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that
which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and
biological design tools.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing “firmly
opposes any country’s development, possession or use of biological
weapons.”</p>
<p>This latest move by the United States follows recent policy decisions
that reflect Washington’s broad aim to limit Beijing’s access to U.S.
technology and data.</p>
<p>Washington announced on Monday that it would tighten Beijing’s access
to AI chip and technology exports by implementing new regulations that
cap the number of chips that can be exported to certain countries,
including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p>This month, the ban on popular Chinese-owned social media TikTok is
planned to go into effect due to U.S. concerns over its potential to
share sensitive data with China’s government.</p>

‘TikTok Refugees’ migrate to another Chinese app as ban looms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As TikTok’s Sunday deadline to divest or face a U.S.
ban approaches, hundreds of thousands of American users of the popular
social media video app say they are migrating to another Chinese social
media app, Xiaohongshu, or RedNote.</p>
<p>Dubbing themselves “TikTok Refugees,” some say they are making the
move in search of a new home; others say their exodus is a form of
protest against the ban.</p>
<p>With just days to go before the deadline, users are facing growing
uncertainty as they wait for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on
whether the ban will be upheld. Reports are now suggesting that TikTok
may just shut down its operations in the United States if the ban goes
through.</p>
<p>“Our government is out of their mind if they think we are going to
stand for this TikTok ban,” said American user Heather Roberts in one
video on Xiaohongshu. “We are just going to a new Chinese app and here
we are.”</p>
<p>Sky Bynum, an 18-year-old makeup content creator in the eastern state
of New Jersey, told VOA that she is joining Xiaohongshu because she
wants to find another social media site with a sense of community.</p>
<p>“The best thing about TikTok is the community on there,” Bynum told
VOA in a video interview via Zoom. “When I posted my first few makeup
videos, TikTok pushed them to the makeup people and I instantly found my
community. I think [the potential ban on TikTok] is awful because I’m
not going to have the same thing that I had on TikTok.</p>
<p>“Xiaohongshu is really cool because a lot of TikTok users were trying
to find new communities on Xiaohongshu,” Bynum added.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is similar to Instagram and Pinterest.
It currently has around 300 million users, most of them in China, and is
widely used to share travel tips, makeup tutorials, and fashion
trends.</p>
<p>The name literally means “little red book” but the company says it’s
not a reference to former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong’s
collection of sayings.</p>
<p>Downloads surge</p>
<p>With many promoting and talking about their exodus to Xiaohongshu on
“TikTok Refugees,” Xiaohongshu became the most downloaded app on Apple’s
U.S. App Store this week.</p>
<p>More than 700,000 new users have joined Xiaohongshu this week,
according to Reuters. Downloads of the app rose more than 200%
year-over-year this week, according to app data research firm Sensor
Tower.</p>
<p>With more American users expected to join Xiaohongshu, some Chinese
users recorded English tutorials or welcome videos for American
users.</p>
<p>“I guess [there has] never been a lifetime or history time [that] a
platform has Chinese and Americans come together and have direct views.
So welcome and we respect you,” Zhou Shu-Fu, a Chinese Xiaohongshu user
from the southwestern province of Sichuan, said in a video released on
Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Compared to Chinese social media users’ enthusiasm, the Chinese
government offered a more cautious comment on the influx of American
TikTok users to Xiaohongshu, describing the phenomenon as a “personal
choice.”</p>
<p>“China has always supported and encouraged strengthening cultural
exchanges and promoting mutual understanding among the peoples of all
countries,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during
the regular press conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The influx of American users has also prompted Xiaohongshu to build
Chinese-English translation tools and hire English content moderators,
according to the Reuters news agency and Chinese media outlets. Most of
the posts on the app are in Chinese and RedNote does not have an
auto-translate function.</p>
<p>Some American users tell VOA that their interactions with Chinese
users are helping to increase their curiosity about China.</p>
<p>“My experience on RedNote makes me realize how toxic American social
media has gotten and I’m excited to learn some basic Chinese and learn
about what it’s really like in China,” Kia Epley, a 44-year-old engineer
from Las Vegas, told VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>TikTok content creators say they are looking for more than just a
safe and welcoming community. One key concern for them is how they can
keep making a living on social media.</p>
<p>“Most of my income is made on TikTok so if the ban comes into effect,
a big chunk of my income will get taken away,” said Essence Whitaker, a
28-year-old makeup content producer in Michigan.</p>
<p>“A lot of content creators in the U.S. will be unemployed,” she told
VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to TikTok for comment on the exodus but has yet to
receive a response.</p>
<p>Tech media The Information reported on Tuesday that TikTok plans to
shut the app for American users when the federal ban comes into effect
on Sunday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Trend or temporary protest?</p>
<p>While the migration of American users to Xiaohongshu continues, some
users say it remains unclear whether the exodus is a temporary
phenomenon or a long-term trend. TikTok has more than 170 million users
and so far, less than a million have moved over to Xiaohongshu.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the move to Xiaohongshu is going to be long-term
because the biggest thing that creators worry about is monetization.
Xiaohongshu doesn’t have that feature so I think other creators are
still looking for an alternative to TikTok,” Bynum in New Jersey told
VOA.</p>
<p>But others say similarities between TikTok and Xiaohongshu may help
convince some American users to stay on the Chinese app.</p>
<p>“I like how real TikTok is because you get to see people’s natural
reactions,” said Whitaker in Michigan, adding that Xiaohongshu has that
same vibe.</p>
<p>“While I can’t tell whether people are going to stay on the app or
not, I think the authenticity of the content will keep some users on
there,” she told VOA in a video interview.</p>
<p>While many American users are excited about the prospect of
Xiaohongshu being an alternative to TikTok, some analysts describe the
mass migration as “going from the frying pan into the fire.”</p>
<p>“TikTok is owned by a Chinese company but it has international
operations, which means there are theoretically several layers between
TikTok and the Chinese Party-State,” said Bethany Allen, the head of
China Investigations and Analysis at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute.</p>
<p>But “there are no layers of insulation between Xiaohongshu and
Beijing,” she told VOA by phone, adding that issues such as political
censorship or lack of data privacy protection could be “far worse” on
Xiaohongshu than TikTok.</p>
<p>American users “are going to have absolutely no power to pressure
Xiaohongshu as a company to do anything,” Allen added.</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment but has yet to receive
a response.</p>
<p>And despite the friendly interactions between Chinese and American
users on Xiaohongshu over the last few days, experts said the “honeymoon
period” may not last long.</p>
<p>“I think the Chinese government is probably going to get spooked [by
the interaction between American users and Chinese users],” Sarah Cook,
an independent China analyst, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>She added that Beijing could impose a temporary shutdown on
Xiaohongshu to implement some moderation or initiate “a mass cleanout”
of accounts or content deemed inappropriate or sensitive on the app.</p>

House says Biden leaving Ukraine in strongest position possible</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>While U.S. President Joe Biden views his response to Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine as a cornerstone of his foreign policy legacy,
critics argue he missed a historic opportunity to help Ukraine win the
war. </p>
<p>Michael Carpenter, director for Europe at the National Security
Council, spoke with VOA, defending the administration’s policies on
Ukraine, stating they were undeterred by Russia’s nuclear threats, and
attributing Ukraine’s lack of success in regaining lost territories to
manpower shortages. </p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
 </p>
<p>VOA: Is President Biden leaving Ukraine in the strongest position
possible?  </p>
<p>Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at the National
Security Council: He is. Look, the United States has given Ukraine every
capability militarily that they have asked for. We have secured through
painstaking diplomacy with our G7 partners a $50 billion loan. We have
lifted all restrictions on rules of engagement for our military systems,
for our weapons that we have provided to Ukraine. And we have worked
with the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian leadership to devise a
strategy for them to be able to defend themselves and ideally negotiate
from a position of strength where they can achieve their aims to
maintain a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine. That’s always
been our goal and it remains our goal. I fail to mention the sanctions
and the costs that we have levied on the Russian Federation.
Unprecedented sanctions in the energy sector and in the financial sector
over the course of the last three months. So were handing things off, I
think, on very good terms.  </p>
<p>VOA: Does it mean that Ukraine, in your view, is ready to enter any
possible negotiations with Russia next year from the position of
strength?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, look, I think it’s very important that Ukraine’s
leaders, that President Zelensky in particular, decide when he wants to
negotiate with the Russians. And what I will say is, at this point in
time, I do not assess the President Putin wants to enter into a
negotiation on good faith on anything other than the terms for the
capitulation of Ukraine. So Ukraine has to decide when it feels that it
is empowered to enter into this negotiation. And it’ll be up to the next
administration to hold the Russians’ feet to the fire and ensure that
they have the appropriate leverage to ensure that this is not a sellout
of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but that this is a negotiation that leads to a
just, durable, lasting peace, that preserves Ukraine as a sovereign,
democratic, independent state. </p>
<p>VOA: But is Ukraine in the strongest possible position for that?
Because that was one of the goals.  </p>
<p>Carpenter: It is, under the circumstances. Look, war is messy. War
involves all kinds of suffering. And Ukraine has certainly suffered over
the course of the more than 1000 days of Russia’s brutal aggression
against it. At the end of the day, Russia has occupied parts of Ukraine
that I wish had not come to pass. But there are also realities in this
war. And one of those realities has to do with manpower on the two sides
of the front lines of this battle space. And Ukraine simply has fewer
people on the battle space than Russia is able to muster. And that has
resulted in the situation that we’re in today. I think Ukraine is in a
strong position. I think it’s in a strong position financially. I think
the capabilities that we have given, the investments we’ve made in
things like Ukrainian production of unmanned aerial vehicles, in terms
of the capabilities, the armored vehicles that we’ve provided, the
HIMARS systems that have been highly effective, the air defense systems,
including the Patriot, all of that has been, I think, incredibly useful
for Ukraine. Of course, the situation remains tenuous in certain parts
of the Donbass, and that is simply a reality of this war.  </p>
<p>VOA: You said that the Biden administration achieved its goals
towards Ukraine, but wasn’t, at some point, the goal a victory of
Ukraine? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carpenter: Ideally, Ukraine would have been able to liberate its
territory. I think there’s still hope that Ukraine can continue to work
towards not just defense but also liberating some of its land. But at
the end of the day, this boils down to what I said earlier. This is a
fundamentally a physics and a math problem in terms of the number of
people on both sides of the front lines. And Russia is able to bring
more soldiers to bear in this war than Ukraine has been able to. And we
can give all the capabilities: from F-16s to Abrams tanks to HIMARS
systems, ATACMS missiles, you name it. But without the manpower on the
front lines, it’s impossible to achieve what you have just outlined,
which is complete liberation of all of Ukraine’s territory. And so,
look, it’s up to Ukrainians again to decide when and under what
circumstances they want to negotiate. But we have set them up for
success, given the capabilities that we have provided, which I just want
to remind your viewers, is close to $70 billion in security assistance.
That is a significant amount of capability that the United States has
provided.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOA: You mentioned the assistance. In December, you assured us that
the United States and the Biden administration will use all of that
approved funds to provide Ukraine military assistance. But now there is
$3.8 billion that this administration is leaving for the next. Why
didn’t the Biden administration use those funds? And do you have any
concern that the next administration might not want to use these funds
to support Ukraine?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, you know, I don’t want to get into a complex
discussion of the way our budgetary process works, but there is a
difference between authorized funds and obligated funds. So we have
provided all of the funds that Congress has obligated for Ukraine.
That’s not all the funds that have been authorized. But it takes
coordination between the administration and Congress to be able to move
all of that money. We have moved all of it that we had available to us.
Yes, the next administration will now have the option to use some of
that authorized money to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine. And
some of what we have obligated is on contract, or is en route, and will
arrive in the coming weeks. But all of that is available to the next
administration to continue to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>VOA: Before leaving office, Biden’s administration, as you said,
imposed major energy sanctions against Russia. Do you think that these
measures might be something that pushes Russia economy closer to a
collapse and something that can actually stop Russia’s war machine? </p>
<p>Carpenter: Well, our hope is that this additional pressure, which is
extraordinary because we have imposed full blocking sanctions on two of
the largest Russian oil companies. Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft,
together with over 180 vessels from Russia’s shadow fleet. We hope that
additional cost in position will bring Putin closer to a realistic and
durable solution to this conflict when he sits down at the negotiating
table eventually, whenever that happens. I think, of course, any type of
sanctions that reduce the revenues available to the Russian Federation
is less money in the hands of those who fuel Russia’s war machine and
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. And it provides more space for
Ukraine to be able to negotiate from a position of strength.  </p>
<p>VOA: In his foreign policy speech yesterday, President Biden
mentioned as one of his accomplishments that he was able to prevent a
direct confrontation between two nuclear powers, the United States and
Russia. Many analysts that we’re talking to say that fears of nuclear
escalation prevented President Biden from helping Ukraine win the war.
Why was the United States deterred by Russia’s “red lines,” but not vice
versa? </p>
<p>Carpenter: Nobody was deterred. The United States provided every
capability that Ukraine asked for. It is only logical that as the
world’s largest nuclear superpower, that the United States has to factor
in escalation management. </p>
<p>Anyone who says to the contrary is being irresponsible about foreign
policy and does not sit in the Oval Office and have to make those
weighty decisions.  </p>
<p>VOA: But does it send a signal that Russia’s “nuclear card” will
always beat everything else?  </p>
<p>Carpenter: No, it does not, because the Ukrainians have done
extraordinarily well at certain points on the battlefield. But this
fundamentally gets back to what the question you raised earlier, which
is manpower. And that’s not a variable that the United States
controls. </p>
<p>VOA: How do you hope the next administration approaches the policy
towards Ukraine? And how does President Biden feel about the fact that
his legacy towards Ukraine will be largely defined by the policies of
the next administration? </p>
<p>Carpenter: I’m not going to speak to what the next administration
will do or won’t do. I will just say that, again, this administration,
we have tried to hand off a situation where Russia is both on its back
foot, thanks to our sanctions in the energy and financial spheres; [and]
Ukraine is in a solid macro financial state thanks to the $50 billion
loan that we negotiated together with our G-7 partners, and that Ukraine
has the capabilities militarily to be able to continue to maintain the
defense of its territory.</p>

California faces new fire-spreading wind threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands in Southern California faced new threats of
fire-spreading high winds on Wednesday as firefighters continued to
fight wildfires in the greater Los Angeles area that have killed at
least 25 people and left nearly 30 missing.</p>
<p>A day after firefighters got a reprieve with lighter winds than
expected, gusts were hitting up to 56 kilometers per hour on the Pacific
coast and 88 kilometers per hour in the mountains before dawn, National
Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall said.</p>
<p>“This is really just the last push of these winds here today,” Hall
said. “Hopefully, if we get through today, we’re going to have some
better conditions for late week, especially into Friday and
Saturday.”</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued a high-level “particularly
dangerous situation” warning through 3 p.m. local time Wednesday and
extended a red-flag warning through Thursday for some areas north of the
city.</p>
<p>“Please stay on guard for a fast-moving fire,” forecasters said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, weaker-than-expected winds had allowed firefighters to
make some progress in containing the two largest blazes, the Palisades
and Eaton fires, but they were far from fully controlled. Authorities
said that the Palisades blaze was 19% contained and the Eaton fire
45%.</p>
<p>But no more homes or major structures were reported burning in the
two blazes, although officials said embers could still be lingering
unseen and that it could take weeks to fully extinguish them.</p>
<p>The wildfires, which ignited on January 7, have displaced more than
100,000 people and left thousands more on edge, wondering whether they
could be forced to evacuate their homes and flee for safety on a
moment’s notice. More than 82,000 people in Los Angeles County are under
evacuation orders, with another 90,400 under evacuation warnings, county
Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters.</p>
<p>Diminishing winds will likely make it easier for firefighters to gain
control of the blazes, though meteorologists have warned the dangerous
Santa Ana windstorms may return early next week. Weather forecasts show
little to no chance of rain.</p>
<p>Utility companies have shut off power to more than 77,000 households
to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday.</p>
<p>“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually
see it,” Bass said.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

<h2
id="in-farewell-address-biden-warns-of-concentration-of-power-and-wealth-1">In
farewell address, Biden warns of concentration of power and wealth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — In his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday
evening, U.S. President Joe Biden warned of the dangers of the
concentration of power and wealth, highlighting the emergence of an
“oligarchy” and a “tech-industrial complex.”</p>
<p>“The dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few
ultra wealthy people, the dangerous consequences if their abuse of power
is left unchecked,” he said. “Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in
America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens
our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedom.”</p>
<p>The president did not say who he meant by oligarchy. But some of the
nation’s biggest billionaires including Elon Musk have forged close ties
with President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday.</p>
<p>Musk spent more than $100 million towards Trump’s reelection, while
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos have made large
donations to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>
<p>Without mentioning names, Biden made a jab at Zuckerberg’s recent
decision that his social media company, which owns Facebook and
Instagram, will stop working with fact checkers.</p>
<p>“The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media
is giving up on fact checking,” Biden said. “The truth is smothered by
lies told for power and for profit.”</p>
<p>Gaza ceasefire</p>
<p>Biden ended his term on a high note on foreign policy. Just hours
earlier, he announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a
ceasefire-and-hostage agreement in Gaza.</p>
<p>“It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has
been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in
Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking
American diplomacy,” Biden said in a statement. “My diplomacy never
ceased in their efforts to get this done.”</p>
<p>The deal will largely be implemented by the incoming administration,
and in his farewell Biden said he is instructing his team to keep the
incoming administration fully informed.</p>
<p>Trump immediately sought to take credit for the deal, posting on
social media that “the ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a
result of our Historic Victory in November.”</p>
<p>On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving
the incoming administration with a “very strong hand to play.”</p>
<p>“We’re leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances,
whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,” Biden said in his
foreign policy address delivered Monday. “An America that once again is
leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together
behind our plans and visions.”</p>
<p>The president again defended his decision to withdraw the United
States from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have
criticized the manner with which Biden ended America’s longest war as
chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan
civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul.</p>
<p>Winter of peril and possibilities</p>
<p>In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his
administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021,
attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on
overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won.</p>
<p>“Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of
possibilities,” he said in the letter. “But we came together as
Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more
prosperous, and more secure.”</p>
<p>It was Biden’s fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office.
In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, he explained his
decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to
run against Trump in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the
special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to
cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report.
Smith’s report said the evidence would have been sufficient to convict
the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made
it impossible for the prosecution to continue.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special
counsel’s work as politically motivated.</p>
<p>In July the U.S. Supreme Court granted Trump sweeping protections
from criminal liability over his role in trying to undermine his 2020
defeat. Biden used his farewell address to call for a constitutional
amendment to end immunity for sitting presidents.</p>
<p>Biden’s legacy</p>
<p>Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to
Gallup. Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian from Vanderbilt
University in Tennessee, said the president’s legacy will be affected by
how Trump governs in the next four years.</p>
<p>“If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos,
or if there’s more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered
more favorably,” he told VOA. “If Trump really proves to be as dangerous
to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think
he may be seen as very prophetic.”</p>
<p>Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S.
foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in
the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be
noted by historians for his legislative achievements but “won’t be
remembered as fondly.”</p>
<p>The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the
Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>The sheet highlighted historic economic progress that added 16.6
million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth
by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and
semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation
Reduction Act and CHIPS Act.</p>
<p>The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair
taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a “stronger, fairer economy,”
creating opportunity from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Biden ended his farewell address by thanking the nation for the
privilege to serve.</p>
<p>“I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation
where the strength of our institutions and the character of our people
matter and must endure,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now it’s your turn to stand guard.”</p>

id="rubio-vows-to-place-us-interests-above-all-else-as-trumps-top-diplomat">Rubio
vows to place US interests ‘above all else’ as Trump’s top diplomat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is promising to implement
President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” vision as secretary of
state, vowing in his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the incoming
administration will forge a new path by placing American interests
“above all else.” </p>
<p>“Placing our core national interests above all else is not
isolationism,” Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. “It
is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our
national interest is not some outdated relic.” </p>
<p>“The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon
being used against us,” Rubio says. </p>
<p>It’s a remarkable opening salvo from Rubio, who was born in Miami to
Cuban immigrants, and who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino
ever to serve as the nation’s top diplomat. </p>
<p>The confirmation hearing begins a new chapter in the political career
of the 53-year-old Florida Republican, whose relationship with Trump has
evolved over the last decade. Once rivals trading schoolyard insults as
they campaigned for president in 2016, the two men became close allies
as Trump campaigned for another White House term last year. </p>
<p>Rubio first came to Washington as part of the “tea party” wave in
2010 and once advocated for allowing a path to citizenship for
immigrants in the country illegally. But like other Republicans, Rubio’s
views on immigration have shifted toward the hardline stance of Trump,
who has pledged to aggressively pursue deportations once he takes office
on Monday. </p>
<p>Unlike many of Trump’s Cabinet selections, Rubio is expected to
easily win confirmation, notching support not only from Republicans but
also Democrats who endorse him as a “responsible” pick to represent the
U.S. abroad. Many expect he will be among the first of Trump’s Cabinet
picks approved. </p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz, who served alongside Rubio on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said he has high hopes that the Florida
Republican will reject the isolationist approach of other Trump
allies. </p>
<p>“I think Marco is a hawk, but he’s also an internationalist, and I
think the challenge for him will be to maintain the long bipartisan
tradition of America being indispensable in world affairs,” the Hawaii
lawmaker told AP. “And there are people in the Trump world who want us
to run away from being the leaders of the free world. And I’m hoping
that Marco’s instincts towards American strength will win the day.” </p>
<p>Rubio’s approach to foreign affairs is grounded in his years of
service on the Foreign Relations committee and the Senate Intelligence
panel. In his speeches and writings, he’s delivered increasingly stern
warnings about growing military and economic threats to the United
States, particularly from China, which he says has benefited from a
“global world order” that he characterizes as obsolete. </p>
<p>China, Rubio will tell the committee, has “lied, cheated, hacked, and
stolen their way to global superpower status, at our expense.” </p>
<p>If confirmed, Rubio will become the leader of U.S. foreign policy —
though his role will surely remain secondary to Trump, who relishes the
global stage and frequently uses the bully pulpit against America’s
allies. </p>
<p>Even before taking office, Trump has stirred angst in foreign
capitals by threatening to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland and
suggesting he will pressure Canada to become the nation’s 51st
state. </p>
<p>By winning another term, Trump has won an “unmistakable mandate from
the voters,” Rubio will say. </p>
<p>“They want a strong America. Engaged in the world. But guided by a
clear objective, to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity
here at home.” </p>
<p>A Biden administration decision to rescind Cuba’s designation as a
state sponsor of terrorism with just days left in office is likely to
irk Rubio, who has long supported tough sanctions on the communist-run
island. </p>
<p>Rubio’s office did not respond to multiple queries Tuesday about the
senator’s reaction to the move, which many believe will almost certainly
be reversed by the Trump administration. </p>
<p>Secretaries of state have played a key role in formulating the
foreign policy of the country since its founding, starting with the
first one, Thomas Jefferson, who served in the top Cabinet position
under President George Washington. </p>
<p>Since then, Jefferson, as well as his 19th century successors James
Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James
Buchanan, have all gone on to be elected president. </p>
<p>More recent secretaries of state have been less successful in their
political ambitions, including John Kerry, who lost the 2004
presidential election to President George W. Bush before becoming the
top diplomat, and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to
Trump. </p>
<p>The most successful secretaries of state have been known for their
closeness to the presidents whom they serve, notably James Baker under
George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice under George W. Bush and, to some
extent, Clinton under Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Like Clinton, Rubio was once a political rival to the president-elect
who nominated them. However, the Clinton-Obama relationship during the
2008 Democratic primaries was not nearly as hostile as that between
Trump and Rubio in the 2016 GOP primaries, which was marked by
name-calling and personal insults. </p>
<p>Trump had an acrimonious relationship with his first secretary of
state, Rex Tillerson. Trump fired him from the position via a social
media post less than two years into his term.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Hydrogen. What are you even supposed to think about it? If you’ve spent
serious time focusing on climate policy, you’ve heard the hype about
hydrogen — about the miraculous things that it might do to eliminate
carbon pollution from cars, power plants, steel mills, or more. You’ve
also seen that hype fizzle out — even as governments have poured
billions of dollars into making it work.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse give you a rough
guide for how to think about clean hydrogen, which could help
decarbonize the industrial — even the molecular — side of the economy by
storing energy and helping to make clean steel and chemicals. Do we
really need hydrogen to fight climate change? Where would it be useful?
And why has it failed to take off in the past? What will Trump and China
mean for global hydrogen policy? Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer,
the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor
of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>This is the next crazy thing that I
think is just starting to kind of bubble up to the public awareness:
Basically, hydrogen itself is not a climate forcer. It doesn’t warm the
planet the way methane or [hydrofluorocarbons] or CO2 does. But it does
react in the atmosphere in ways that increase the concentration of
greenhouse gases.<br/><br/><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I think
specifically that right now, we talk about when methane leaks into the
atmosphere. And it may apply to other greenhouse gases, too, but the big
one that you tend to hear about is that when methane leaks into the
atmosphere from natural gas — and of course, we’re very worried about
methane leaks. Because the thing about methane is that it traps a lot of
heat, but it breaks down really quickly, right? So it tends to break
down, unlike carbon dioxide, which, when you release it into the
atmosphere. sticks around for millennia. When you release it into the
atmosphere, it captures a lot of heat, but then breaks down into a
smaller amount of CO2 after about 20 years.<br/> <br/>The issue, and why
it breaks down, that — we never talk about this, or we had no need to
talk about this until hydrogen — and it’s crazy because the world is a
closed system, or a largely closed system, right? Why it breaks down is
it reacts with the free hydroxyl radicals floating around in the
atmosphere.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Right, OH molecules.<br/>
<br/><strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, what else reacts with OH molecules?
Hydrogen. And so if we leak too much industrially produced hydrogen into
the atmosphere, it could mess with the rate of breakdown of all methane
in the global atmosphere, and thus increase the global warming potential
of natural gas.<br/><br/><strong>Jenkins: </strong>It makes the methane
last, traps more heat, yeah. So let the record show that Robinson Meyer,
the journalist, accurately captured the atmospheric chemistry of this
process better than Jesse Jenkins, professor at Princeton. Nicely
done.<br/>

firefighters battle wildfires as forecasters warn of dangerous
winds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Warnings were in place again Wednesday in the Los Angeles area for
the prospect of strong winds combining with dry conditions to spread
wildfires as firefighters battled a series of blazes in the region that
have already killed at least 25 people.</p>
<p>After winds were weaker than expected during the day Tuesday, the
National Weather Service said the region was “not out of the woods yet,”
with the potential for a surge in winds through early Wednesday
afternoon.</p>
<p>Utility companies shut off power to more than 77,000 households to
prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes.</p>
<p>The winds threatened to undermine incremental gains that firefighters
have made in recent days as they try to control two main fires that have
been burning since last week, as well as a smaller fire that sparked
Monday.</p>
<p>The California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire)
said the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles had burned 96
square kilometers and was 18% contained as of early Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the
east side of the city was 35% contained and has burned 57 square
kilometers, Cal Fire said.</p>
<p>About 88,000 people remained under evacuation orders with another
nearly 85,000 being warned they might be ordered to evacuate. Los
Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna encouraged people to consider leaving
when they get a warning without waiting for an order. He said deputies
have had to rescue many people who waited until the last minute after
receiving orders. </p>
<p>Authorities said nearly 30 people remain missing, and that the death
toll was likely to rise as search crews gain access to areas that have
already burned.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday.</p>
<p>“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually
see it,” Bass said. </p>

Japanese companies send landers on moon missions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two moon landers built by private U.S. and Japanese companies are on
their way to the moon after lifting off early Wednesday on a shared ride
aboard a SpaceX rocket.</p>
<p>The launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the latest
in a public-private program that put a spacecraft from Intuitive
Machines on the moon last year.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s launch included a lander from Japanese space exploration
company ispace that is carrying a rover with the capability of
collecting lunar dirt and testing potential food and water sources on
the moon.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is also carrying a small red “Moonhouse” built by
Swedish artist Mikael Genberg.</p>
<p>The ispace mission is expected to reach its destination on the moon’s
far north in four to five months.</p>
<p>The company is making its second attempt at a lunar landing, after a
2023 mission failed in the final stages. </p>
<p>Also aboard the rocket heading toward the moon is a lander from U.S.
company Firefly Aerospace that is set to carry out 10 experiments for
NASA.</p>
<p>The planned experiments include gathering dirt and measuring
subsurface temperatures.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is expected to arrive in about 45 days.</p>

did US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive
order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in
America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures
to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other
adversaries.</p>
<p>But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific,
off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to
advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological
relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible
in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi’s existing
ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology
regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list.</p>
<p>Exclusion not a surprise</p>
<p>The Commerce Department’s policy framework divides the world into
three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with
unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that
will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual
exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia
that face maximum restrictions.</p>
<p>India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like
Israel and close friends such as Singapore.</p>
<p>Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said
that India’s relationship with Russia “puts it outside a super safe
category.”</p>
<p>India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported
its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties
during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India’s rival
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington’s Stimson Center
think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian
companies of aiding Russia’s war on Ukraine, but stressed that while
being excluded is a disappointment, it’s “not a setback for India.”</p>
<p>He also pointed to the perception that “India’s ability to control
and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of
the 18 countries.”</p>
<p>While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say
its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from
some curbs.</p>
<p>Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia
Economies at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure
India’s later participation.</p>
<p>“The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for
some countries to get exemptions that are above what they’re going to
consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list
of countries,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to
India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior
officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to
forge a “strategic technology partnership” and strengthen cooperation
under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology
(iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership.</p>
<p>On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India’s
semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&amp;D collaboration.</p>
<p>During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion
in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging
facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing “India as a
new hub in the global chip ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through
its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and
Production Linked Incentive scheme.</p>
<p>Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been
“terribly surprised” that “they were not included” in the list.</p>
<p>Jones of the Stimson Center agreed.</p>
<p>“Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very
surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going
to happen,” he said.</p>
<p>Ensuring America’s leadership in AI</p>
<p>The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial
intelligence to America’s security and economic strength. According to a
White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to
prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that “the world’s
AI runs on American rails.”</p>
<p>Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of
export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to
prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures
adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has
continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the
technology gap.</p>
<p>According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous
implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy.</p>
<p>“From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as
Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list
of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect
where future data centers are built?” he asked.</p>
<p>Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a
“symbolic gesture than a practical consideration” but has a stern
message for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the
U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you
pick us. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t play one off against the
other. You have to choose,” he concluded.</p>

<h2 id="us-sec-sues-elon-musk-over-late-disclosure-of-twitter-stake">US
SEC sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, which accused the world’s richest person of waiting too long
to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social
media company he later bought.</p>
<p>In a complaint filed in Washington, the SEC said Musk violated
federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his
initial purchase of 5% of Twitter’s common shares.</p>
<p>An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days,
or by March 24, 2022, in Musk’s case, when they cross a 5% ownership
threshold.</p>
<p>The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk
bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low
prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which
time he owned a 9.2% stake.</p>
<p>Twitter’s share price rose more than 27% following that disclosure,
the SEC said.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and
disgorge profits he didn’t deserve.</p>
<p>Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022,
and renamed it X.</p>
<p>Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the
culmination of the regulator’s “multi-year campaign of harassment”
against his client.</p>
<p>“Today’s action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an
actual case,” he said. “Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone
sees this sham for what it is.”</p>
<p>Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere “alleged administrative
failure to file a single form — an offense that, even if proven, carries
a nominal penalty.”</p>
<p>Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is worth $417
billion according to Forbes magazine, through businesses such as the
electric car maker Tesla and rocket company.</p>
<p>He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos,
the world’s second-richest person at $232 billion, Forbes said.</p>
<p>The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump’s January 20 presidential
inauguration.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul Atkins,
who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to review many of
Gensler’s rules and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter
shareholders over the late disclosure.</p>
<p>In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted
to defraud other shareholders, and that “all indications” were that his
delay was a mistake.</p>
<p>Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued him in
2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla private and
having secured funding to do so.</p>
<p>He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine, agreeing
to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in advance, and giving
up his role as Tesla’s chairman.</p>
<p>The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed court-ordered
testimony last September for the Twitter probe so he could attend the
launch of SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission at Florida’s Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request, because Musk
later testified and agreed to pay the SEC’s travel costs.</p>

<h2 id="biden-announces-2-new-national-monuments-in-california">Biden
announces 2 new national monuments in California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In an announcement postponed by the Los Angeles
wildfires, President Joe Biden on Tuesday designated two sites in
California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes
while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy
development.</p>
<p>Biden made the designations at an event at the White House, a week
after and on the other side of the country from where he’d originally
planned to do so with a speech in California’s Eastern Coachella
Valley.</p>
<p>The president landed in California on January 6 but made it as far as
Los Angeles before high winds — which helped spark the Los Angeles
blazes — forced officials to scrap the event. It was a stark reminder
that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt
to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to
exacerbate natural disasters.</p>
<p>Instead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert
vistas and an array of plant and animal life.</p>
<p>“I was hoping we were going to do this in place,” the president said.
“This is as close as we could get.”</p>
<p>Biden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern
California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands
National Monument, in Northern California.</p>
<p>The declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining
and other exploration and production initiatives, on the
2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site, and roughly 800 square
kilometers near the California-Oregon border.</p>
<p>The protected area encompasses natural wonders, including the Painted
Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare
species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the
Chuckwalla lizard, which the monument is named for, the White House said
in a statement.</p>
<p>At the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national
monuments around the country yearly when they were young to “witness the
majesty, the beauty.”</p>
<p>“Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation,” he
said. “It’s a birthright we pass on from generation to generation.”</p>
<p>The monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many
Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for
designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River
Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla
Highlands National Monument.</p>
<p>Biden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then
still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal
acts, he simply referred to it as the “highlands” monument, so he didn’t
have to give it another try.</p>
<p>The designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to
conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow
Biden’s recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most
U.S. coastal waters, including in California.</p>
<p>That was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming
Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but
President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse the order.</p>

to lift state sponsor of terrorism designation on Cuba</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress on Tuesday that he intends
to delist Cuba as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism in a deal
facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the
island. </p>
<p>Speaking on the condition of anonymity before the announcement,
senior administration officials told reporters that dozens of political
prisoners and others deemed unjustly detained by U.S. officials would be
freed by noon on January 20. </p>
<p>The announcement also indicated the U.S. would aim to reduce economic
pressure on the island nation. </p>
<p>“Today’s actions demonstrate that President Biden’s Cuba policy,
which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human
rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,” a senior
official told reporters, acknowledging Havana’s “direct dialogue with
the Catholic Church.”   </p>
<p>Hours after Biden’s announcement, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel
said his government would gradually release 553 prisoners after talks
with the church.  </p>
<p>Earlier, his government expressed gratitude.  </p>
<p>“Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the
right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the
government and the people of Cuba,” the country’s foreign ministry said
in a press release. </p>
<p>“The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a
very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy,” it
added. </p>
<p>In Congress, the backlash to Biden’s announcement was swift.  </p>
<p>“Today’s decision is unacceptable on its merits,” Republican Senator
Ted Cruz said in a statement. “The terrorism advanced by the Cuban
regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my
colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the
decision.” </p>
<p>Fellow Republican Representative Carlos Gimenez also criticized the
announcement, predicting a quick reversal on the policy by
President-elect Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“President Biden is a pathetic coward,” Gimenez posted on X. “Come
January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town &amp; President Trump
alongside Secretary of State <span class="citation"
data-cites="SenMarcoRubio">@SenMarcoRubio</span> will not only put #Cuba
BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once &amp; for all!” </p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, human rights groups and activists,
including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing
the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering
of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba’s economic isolation. </p>

id="new-orleans-attacker-had-researched-similar-rampage-and-how-to-access-bourbon-street-balcony">New
Orleans attacker had researched similar rampage, and how to access
Bourbon Street balcony</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE — Before plowing a pickup truck into a crowd of New
Year’s revelers in New Orleans, killing 14 people, the man who carried
out the Islamic State group-inspired attack had researched how to access
a balcony on the city’s famed Bourbon Street and looked up information
about a similar recent attack at a Christmas market in Germany, the FBI
said. </p>
<p>Nearly two weeks after Shamsud-Din Jabbar’s rampage, the FBI
continues to uncover new information detailing the extensive planning by
the 42-year-old Army veteran who scouted out the area multiple times in
the months leading up to the attack. Authorities also have been piecing
together a timeline of his radicalization. </p>
<p>In the early hours of New Year’s Day, Jabbar could be seen on video
surveillance placing two containers with explosive devices, which would
remain undetonated, in the French Quarter. Shortly after, about 3:15
a.m., Jabbar sped a white pickup truck around a police car blockading
the entrance of Bourbon Street, where partygoers continued to wander
around the street lined with bars. He drove through revelers before
crashing and being killed by police in a shootout. Fifty-seven people
were injured, authorities said. </p>
<p>Just hours before the deadly onslaught, Jabbar had searched online
for information about an attack at a busy outdoor Christmas Market in
east Germany that occurred just 10 days earlier and where a car was also
used as a mass weapon, the FBI said on Tuesday. The attack in Europe
left five people dead and more than 200 injured after a car slammed into
a crowd. Police arrested a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia who has
renounced Islam and supports the far-right AfD party. </p>
<p>In other online searches, Jabbar had looked up how to access a
balcony on Bourbon Street, information about Mardi Gras, and several
recent shootings in the city, the FBI said. </p>
<p>But Jabbar’s research ahead of the attack was not limited to online:
He also made a one-day visit to New Orleans from Houston on Nov. 10,
during which he looked for an apartment, the FBI said. While Jabbar
applied to rent the apartment, he later told the landlord that he
changed his mind. </p>
<p>That was not his only visit to New Orleans, though. The FBI had
previously reported that Jabbar had traveled to the city for a planning
trip on Oct. 31, when he used glasses from Meta, the parent company of
Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a

Five Feet That Could Prevent the Next Palisades Fire</h2>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTU1MTYyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODkxMzY2OH0.qOdnOv-IMBfte5SFBVy1MTp0mGB9wm6xqY4oeGs-3qY/image.jpg?width=1185&height=793&coordinates=15%2C0%2C0%2C7"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
For more than four years, California has had a law on the books meant to
protect homes and buildings during an urban firestorm like the Palisade
and Eaton fires. But it’s never gone into effect.
</p>
<p>
In theory, the policy was simple. It directed state officials to develop
new rules for buildings in areas with high fire risk, which would govern
what people were allowed to put within the five-foot perimeter
immediately surrounding their homes. A large body of evidence shows that
clearing this area, known in the fire mitigation world as “zone zero,”
of combustible materials can be the difference between a building that
alights during a wildfire and one that can weather the blaze.
</p>
<p>
The new rules — essentially just a list of items allowed in that
five-foot zone — were due two years ago, by January 1, 2023. But the
State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to consider has yet to begin
a formal rulemaking process. Ask anyone who’s been following this thread
what’s taking so long, and they’ll almost certainly point to one thing:
politics.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a ton of science about what to do, but the science has run into
challenges with social acceptance, and therefore political acceptance,”
Michael Wara, director of Stanford University’s Climate and Energy
Policy Program, told me. People do not want to be told how they can or
can’t landscape or furnish or otherwise adorn the outside of their
homes. Inevitably, when the rules do come out, you’ll hear about Gavin
Newsom coming to take away people’s decks and policing gardens.
</p>
<p>
No one thinks that zone zero rules, if enacted and adhered to, could
have prevented fires in the Pacific Palisades or Altadena or saved every
structure in the recent fires’ path. But alongside other fire mitigation
strategies, zone zero design can significantly lower the chances of a
given building burning, and therefore the chances that a fire will
spread to neighboring buildings, and ultimately reduce the risk of fires
becoming compounding, devastating disasters. Wara likened it to car
safety rules like seatbelts and airbags — people still die in car
accidents, but far fewer than would otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The question now is whether the record-breaking destruction in Los
Angeles will be enough to convince people that zone zero rules are
effective and worthwhile. Past experience shows the answer is not an
obvious yes.
</p>
<h3>
Why homes burn
</h3>
<p>
There are three ways buildings ignite during a wildfire, Yana
Valachovic, a forest scientist with the University of California
Agriculture and Natural Resources Fire Network who specializes in
community resilience and the built environment, told me. They are either
exposed to burning embers, direct flames, or radiant heat, though most
often a combination.

Embers — hot, hard debris of burned material from a fire — can be
carried miles away from their origin by the wind and create new spot
fires next to homes. “What happens with those embers is they get thrown
at the building, they hit the walls, the siding, and then drop to the
base and collect at the base,” Valachovic said, “so you can have not
just one, but thousands of embers at the base of our structures.”
</p>
<p>
Embers can also penetrate buildings through open windows and ventilation
systems. If radiant heat from nearby burning structures causes windows
to shatter or fall out, that can also create new vectors for embers to
enter the home. “Embers find their way,” Valachovic said.
</p>
<p>
Fire mitigation experts promote two strategies for reducing
vulnerability, and they go hand in hand. The first is
<a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/hardening-your-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>home
hardening</u></a>, which could mean building with fire-resistant
materials but also includes smaller but effective actions like covering
air vents with fine mesh screens and sealing gaps to try to block
embers. The second is
<a href="https://readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/defensible-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>creating
so-called “defensible space,”</u></a> or a buffer around the building,
where any vegetation is carefully selected and managed to slow the
spread of fire to and from the building. California divides defensible
space into three different zones: Zone one extends from 5 feet away from
the structure to 30 feet, and zone two goes out to 100 feet away. Then,
of course, there’s zone zero.
</p>
<p>
The state has had regulations on the books to require at least 30 feet
of defensible space in high-risk areas since 1965, and it updated the
standards to establish a two-zone system in 2006. In both cases, the
rules were “really framed around, how do you interrupt flames running at
the building?” said Valachovic. The regulations included thinning trees
and removing lower branches, clearing some trees that were closer to
homes, clearing dead wood and litter, and pruning branches that hang
over buildings. But they still allowed for vegetation right up against
the house.
</p>
<p>
Since then, wildfire post-mortems have found that this scenario of
flames burning a path to a building is not a primary driver of structure
loss. “It was missing the point,” Valachovic told me of the previous
rule structure. “What we’ve seen now for the last decade is that embers
are really driving our home loss issue, and so we’re basically allowing
all this vegetation and combustible material to be present in the zone
that is really very vulnerable.”

<p>
In August 2020, after Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of
emergency in California due to an explosion of wildfires, the state
legislature passed AB 3074, which finally sought to bridge the gap by
creating a new, “ember-resistant zone” — zone zero. Had the rules been
implemented under the timeline mandated by the law, new homes would have
had to comply beginning in 2023, and existing homes would have had to
comply beginning in 2024. Like the earlier defensible space rules, they
would have applied to homes located in parts of the state designated as
Fire Hazard Severity Zones. These are generally areas that you might
think of as the “wildland-urban interface,” where homes abut wildland
vegetation like forests or scrublands, but others extend into more urban
areas. Almost all of the burned area in the Pacific Palisades, for
instance, would have been
<a href="https://lacounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d2ea45d15c784adfa601e84b38060c4e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>subject
to the rules</u></a>, while only a small portion of the homes in
Altadena are in the zone.
</p>
<h3>
Why “zone zero” is political
</h3>
<p>
When I reached out to the California Natural Resources Agency, the
umbrella group for both the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and
CalFire, to ask if there was an updated timeline for the regulations,
one of the first things that Tony Andersen, the Deputy Secretary for
Communications, told me, was not about the timeline but about the
ultimate cost of compliance.
</p>
<p>
“We recognize there are costs associated with doing this work around
homes and structures,” Andersen told me via email, “and we are focused
on identifying options for financial assistance as well as education and
outreach to help owners prepare and prioritize mitigations.” He then
noted that the rulemaking was a “complex process” that the agency wanted
to get right, and said it aimed to present a draft proposal to the Board
“as soon as is feasible, most likely in the coming months.”
</p>
<p>
Andersen’s response illustrates one of several tensions that have made
it difficult to write the zone zero rules — and will ultimately make
them difficult to implement. If the rules say you can’t have a wooden
deck, for example, or you can’t have a fence that touches the building,
homeowners could face costly retrofits. And despite witnessing the
horror of destructive wildfires, many homeowners don’t want to switch
their wooden fence for a metal one, or replace their bushes with gravel.
</p>
<p>
Five feet might sound like a negligible amount of space, but people are
attached to the aesthetics of this zone. Homeowners have become used to
“softening” the line where the walls meet the ground by filling it in
with vegetation, Valachovic told me. “We really developed this idea that
we don’t visually want to see our foundations,” she said. “From a fire
defense perspective, this idea that we have combustible material
basically ringing our houses and our structures, that is problematic.”
</p>
<p>
Several people I interviewed for this story asked if I had seen a
documentary about the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise,
California called <em><em>Bring Your Own Brigade</em></em>. The film
captures a series of city council meetings in 2019, when officials were
considering updating local building standards. They weigh a number of
ideas that would reduce the risk of embers collecting on top of, inside,
or next to homes, including eliminating gutters and requiring roof
overhangs and a five-foot setback for any combustible material.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive
wildfire in state history, killing 85 people, displacing more than
50,000, and destroying more than 18,000 structures. But during a public
hearing, community members lashed out at the potential cost, warned that
new standards would prevent displaced residents from moving back, and
decried the aesthetic implications.
</p>
<p>
“Paradise is an individualistic town,” one person says. “That’s part of
the charm and the quirkiness. We don’t need consistency and uniformity.”
</p>
<p>
In another scene, a city councilmember asks Paradise Fire Chief John
Messina to narrow down the list to just one rule that would make the
community more fire resistant. “That five-foot barrier around your house
is extremely important,” he replies. “That would be the No. 1 thing out
of all of this that I would say would defend your home the best and have
the most impact.” Shortly after, the council votes down the measure.
</p>
<p>
Michael Wara, who recalled the scene to me over the phone, said a
similar thing happened when the fire chief in his community in Mill
Valley tried to get the city council to adopt zone zero rules. “The word
got out in the community that this crazy fire chief was going to make us
rip up our front yards,” he said. When the council convened for a vote,
more than a thousand people showed up to oppose it. The council ended up
passing it as a voluntary measure.
</p>
<p>
To Wara, part of the problem is the language used to communicate these
ideas with the public. “Zone zero” and “hardening” conjure a bunker
mentality, he said. “I do not want my family to live in a bunker that is
hardened to attack. I want my family to live in a home that is
welcoming.”
</p>
<p>
He also thinks the state can reach a compromise, like allowing
succulents and other fire-resistant greenery in zone zero. The rules
don’t have to turn these areas into gravel and concrete wastelands to be
effective.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department recently included photos in a
<a href="https://fire.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Annual-Defensible-Space-Notice_012024.pdf" target="_blank"><u>notice
to homeowners</u></a> about defensible space rules and the upcoming zone
zero regulations that illustrate how landscapes might strike that
balance. The images feature stone walkways immediately next to homes,
followed by raised beds made of metal and concrete containing attractive
landscaping. Not quite “quirky” and “charming,” but far from a barren
dystopia.
</p>
<h3>
Where insurance fits in
</h3>
<p>
Despite the delay in implementing zone zero, California has tried to
pitch it as part of a strategy to solve the state’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>insurance
crisis</u></a>. In 2022, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara
<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/Safer-from-Wildfires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enacted
new rules</u></a> requiring insurance companies to provide discounts to
homeowners who do home hardening retrofits and create defensible space.
</p>
<p>
“That’s terrific,” Dave Jones, the director of the Climate Risk
Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lara’s
predecessor as insurance commissioner, told me. “But you don’t get the
discount if they won’t write you the insurance.”
</p>
<p>
Jones said the bigger issue is that the models insurance companies use
to decide whether or not to write a policy do not account for fire
mitigation efforts. A homeowner could take every action on the list for
home hardening, create a zone zero, live in a community that’s investing
in aggressive fuels reduction, and so on, and insurance companies could
still deny them coverage. Last year, Jones wrote a bill that would have
required companies to change the models they use to determine coverage
to account for mitigation. Several insurance industry trade groups
opposed the bill,
<a href="https://ains.assembly.ca.gov/system/files/2024-06/sb-1060-becker.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arguing</u></a>
that it was “premature and impossible to implement given the real-world
data constraints,” and that it was “inconsistent” with the state’s
efforts to “restore a healthy and competitive insurance market.” It
didn’t pass.
</p>
<p>
If following zone zero guidelines meant having a shot at getting
insurance, maybe people would be more open to doing it, Jones argued to
me. But as things stand, that’s not the case. “I don’t think the failure
is so much in the state developing the standards as it is in the lack of
political courage to stand up to the insurance industry and say, hey,
look, enough is enough. We’re going to pass a law to require your models
to account for this.”
</p>
<p>
This past year, the California legislature passed a law giving existing
homes three years, instead of just one, to comply with zone zero rules
once they are finalized, whenever that is. And if the regulations are
finalized this year, it’s possible that some of the rebuilt structures
in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena will have to meet them.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Valachovic sees hope in fire mitigation work. The narrative
that climate change is driving these destructive wildfires can make
people feel helpless. But there are so many low-cost, simple things
people can do to reduce their exposure. “I just feel like we have a
moral imperative to share practical, reasonable actions that people can
take to make a difference, and to know that with that, the odds improve
substantially.”

finalizes rules banning Chinese, Russian smart cars</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House says it has finalized rules that crack down on
Chinese and Russian automobile technology effectively banning all
personal smart cars from the two countries from entering the U.S.
market.</p>
<p>In a White House fact sheet detailing the decision, the Biden
administration Tuesday said that while connected vehicles offer
advantages, the involvement of foreign adversaries such as China and
Russia in their supply chains presents serious risks granting “malign
actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they
collect.”</p>
<p>“The Department of Commerce has issued a final rule that will
prohibit the sale and import of connected vehicle hardware and software
systems, as well as completed connected vehicles, from the PRC and
Russia,” the fact sheet said.</p>
<p>PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic
of China.</p>
<p>Connected vehicles are smart cars that are designed to be convenient
for consumers and provide safety for drivers, passengers, and
pedestrians through the use of many connected parts such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite connectivity.</p>
<p>“Cars today aren’t just steel on wheels; they’re computers,” said
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when speaking on the rule.</p>
<p>“This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC- and
Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads,” said
Raimondo.</p>
<p>The new rule is the “culmination of a year-long examination” of
potential risks posed by connected vehicles and will “help the United
States defend against the PRC’s cyber espionage and intrusion
operations, which continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. critical
infrastructure and public safety.”</p>
<p>The crackdown on cars follows Washington’s announcement earlier this
month that the U.S. consider new rules aimed at addressing risks posed
by drones that utilize technology from China and Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need to balance technological
progress with the protection of national security interests.</p>

The
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/politics/biden-first-veto/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
veto</u></a> of Joe Biden’s presidency, in March 2023, came on a bill
that would have overturned a Department of Labor rule allowing
retirement funds to consider environment, social, and governance factors
— commonly known as ESG — when making investment decisions. At the time,
it seemed like a good representation of where the issue stood: Though
there was a conservative backlash against ESG investing, much of which
revolves around whether companies are incorporating climate risks into
their planning, the backlash was more bark than bite. ESG not only
seemed here to stay, it was gaining in prominence as more investors and
Wall Street firms realized they could no longer ignore the effects of
climate change on the economic prospects of the companies they were
funding.
</p>
<p>
Less than two years later, the picture looks rather different — at least
politically. There is still
<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/sustainable-investing/global-esg-funds-attract-104-billion-q3-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
$3 trillion</u></a> invested in ESG funds worldwide, the vast majority
of it in Europe. But here in the U.S., the backlash has only grown
stronger, and with Donald Trump’s election, there has been a Wall Street
stampede away from public commitments to assess climate risk as a key
component of investment decisions. There’s no way to know how much
long-term effect this change will have on emissions, but the reversal in
the public stance of the financial sector has been swift and intense.
</p>
<p>
Let’s begin with the banks. In the space of a month, the six largest
banks in the United States — Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan — all
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/jpmorgan-says-leave-net-zero-banking-alliance-2025-01-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled
out</u></a> of the
<a href="https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/commitment/frequently-asked-questions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Net-Zero
Banking Alliance</u></a>, an international United Nations-sponsored
group under which member banks commit to pursuing net-zero carbon
emissions from their lending and investments by 2050.
</p>
<p>
While Trump’s election may have been the tipping point, it comes after
an organized campaign waged at the state level over the past couple of
years, as Republican attorneys general have pressured and threatened the
finance industry into abandoning its efforts to contribute to the
mitigation of climate change.
</p>
<p>
In the spring of 2023, 23 Republican AGs
<a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>threatened</u></a>
the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (like the NZBA, a UN-sponsored group)
with antitrust action,
<a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-15-NZIA-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>saying</u></a>
it was pursuing “an activist climate agenda.” Companies began
<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2023/04/19/717287.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaving</u></a>,
and a year later, the group
<a href="https://www.unepfi.org/insurance/insurance/projects/net-zero-insurance-alliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disbanded</u></a>.
The effort against the banking alliance followed a similar pattern:
<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/divisions/public-finance/ABC%20Letter%20Draft%20Net%20Zero%20Alliance%2010.17.23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Threats</u></a>
of legal action from Republican attorneys general, followed by a
pullback from the banks.
</p>
<p>
Like insurance companies and banks, investment firms are clearly feeling
the pressure. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world,
recently
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/blackrock-quits-climate-group-wall-streets-latest-environmental-step-back-2025-01-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled
out</u></a> of the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group similar
to those for insurers and banks, citing “legal inquiries from various
public officials.” That included a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-sued-by-republican-states-over-climate-accords-2024-11-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lawsuit</u></a>
filed by Texas and 10 other Republican states, alleging that BlackRock
and other firms were unfairly harming the fossil fuel industry with
their investment decisions. This week, the NZAMI released
<a href="https://www.netzeroassetmanagers.org/update-from-the-net-zero-asset-managers-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
statement</u></a> saying that in response to “different regulatory and
client expectations,” it is launching an internal review, and meanwhile
“suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting”
of climate goals.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been
<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/jordan-and-massie-demand-information-over-130-companies-surrounding-their" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issuing</u></a>
reports and press releases condemning the “woke ESG cartel,” which they
claim consists of “left-wing activists and major financial institutions
that collude to impose radical environmental, social, and governance
goals on American companies.” After the election, those Republicans now
control both houses of Congress, as well as the White House.
</p>
<p>
So it’s a good bet that the pressure on the finance industry from
Washington will only increase, especially with a new administration that
combines dismissal of climate change with an eagerness to bring
corporations to heel. In many cases, key administration positions will
be staffed by former employees of the very fossil fuel companies that
oppose real climate action, or at least by their allies. One vivid
example: Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental
Protection Agency,
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trumps-pick-to-lead-epa-was-paid-tens-of-thousands-to-write-op-eds-criticizing-climate-policies-and-esg/ar-BB1rk50z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>revealed</u></a>
in disclosure forms that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars to pen
op-eds attacking ESG investing.
<a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/B4586F4FD7718EA485258C0F00336FAE/%24FILE/Zeldin%2C%20Lee%20%20final278.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>His
forms</u></a> list only the PR firms that paid him, not the clients on
whose behalf they did so.
</p>
<p>
These pullbacks from climate pledges are clearly motivated by fear, and
may even be taken with regret by some of the CEOs making the decisions.
If that is the case, however, it is not a universal sentiment. The
<em><em>Financial Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf876b19-8c69-498b-95f5-d018618d99ec" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that “Some Wall Streeters also feel able to embrace making money openly,
without nodding to any broader social goals. ‘Most of us don’t have to
kiss ass because, like Trump, we love America and capitalism,’ one
said.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s the kicker: These alliances that are now wavering began with few
requirements in order to bring in as many participants as possible; only
later would companies have to meet more reporting and emissions goals.
But “as accountability mechanisms started to come into play, at the same
time we started to see the conservative backlash against it,” Tensie
Whelan, founding director of the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable
Business, told me. Now, “they’re all running scared.”
</p>
<p>
Though some critics charge that ESG is mostly about greenwashing, many
financial actors — banks, asset managers, investors — have embraced
greener investing because it is both good for the planet and good for
business. If a company is exposed to climate risk but fails to account
for it in its long-term strategy, that company is probably a bad
investment. Investments incorporating sustainability considerations tend
to perform as well or better than ordinary investment vehicles — the
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/brochure-sp-500-esg-index.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>S&amp;P
500 ESG Index</u></a>, for instance, has outperformed the standard
S&amp;P 500. And a
<a href="https://hipinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HIPinvestor-Pensions-Dems-Reps-Indeps-ProESG-AntiESG-YE2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study
by HIP Investor</u></a> showed that public pension funds in blue states
that incorporated ESG factors have generated higher returns than
red-state funds that eschewed them.
</p>
<p>
“I would hope and assume that at some point there will be some
class-action suits” against states that have turned away from ESG
investing, and in so doing cost taxpayers money, Whelan said.
<a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2024/10/21/republican-states-pass-17-anti-esg-laws-democratic-states-pass-8-pro-esg-in-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
2024</u></a>, 17 Republican-run states passed bills restricting ESG
investments with state funds, while eight Democratic states passed
pro-ESG bills.
</p>
<p>
When banks or investment firms abandon climate alliances or pull back
from climate goals in other ways, they nearly always put out statements
reiterating their commitment to reducing emissions. While those might be
sincere, the most important message is that the threats and pressure are
effective. And that’s what has become so clear: Conservatives are
energized and emboldened to roll back corporate efforts to address
climate change, and are using every tool they have — legislation,
litigation, threats, public pressure campaigns — to destroy those
initiatives.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for pressure from the other side.
Whelan notes that blue states “are very adamant about having key
sustainability criteria” in their investments, and as younger
generations accumulate more wealth, they are more likely to demand
sustainability where they put their money. As for Wall Street responding
to political pressure by backing away from its climate goals, “this
retrenchment is unfortunate,” Whelan told me, but “I do think it’s
temporary, and I think they know that. Because they’re not stupid.”

House Speaker orders Capitol flags raised to full height for Trump
inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday ordered
that flags at the Capitol be raised to their full height on Inauguration
Day, pausing a 30-day flag-lowering order following the death of former
President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>The Republican leader’s decision means that President-elect Donald
Trump will not take the oath of office for his second term under a
half-staff flag, a prospect that he had previously complained about.</p>
<p>It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors
who have announced that flags in their states would be raised on
Inauguration Day to mark Trump’s second term.</p>
<p>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee did so on
Tuesday, noting in social media posts that U.S. flags across their
states would be relowered on Jan. 21 in honor of Carter. Texas Governor
Greg Abbott issued a similar notice on Monday.</p>
<p>The 30-day flag-lowering period, set into motion with President Joe
Biden’s order, affects flags at federal government buildings and their
grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad,
including military installations and vessels. It runs through Jan. 28,
which encompasses Trump’s inauguration and first week in office. In line
with Biden’s order, governors throughout the country issued their own
orders to govern flags in their respective states.</p>
<p>The incoming president has expressed consternation that flags would
still be lowered when he takes the oath, and it’s possible that he could
order the overall reversal of Biden’s decision once he’s installed as
president on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>“Democrats are all ‘giddy’” about the notion that flags will be
lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants to see this,” Trump wrote. He added that “no American
can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN!”</p>
<p>Trump has already acted over the flags that he can control: at his
home in Florida. In the days following Carter’s burial, a large U.S.
flag at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club was observed flying at its full
height, despite an order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that mirrors
Biden’s.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, DeSantis had not made alterations to the flag order in
his own state.</p>
<p>The U.S. flag code lays out parameters for lowering the U.S. flag to
half-staff, including a 30-day period for current or former presidents
to cover flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as
well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including
military installations and vessels.</p>

id="despite-international-concerns-doctors-say-china-flu-like-virus-is-no-covid-19">Despite
international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no
COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Reports of rising cases of a flu-like illness in China, where
COVID-19 was first detected five years ago, sparked international
concerns about the potential for another worldwide pandemic.</p>
<p>But medical experts say the human metapneumovirus, known as HMPV, is
no COVID-19.</p>
<p>“That’s a routine virus that commonly causes upper respiratory tract
infections, such as bronchitis that might cause cough and sinuses,” says
Dr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases. “I don’t feel we
should be especially worried about it. It is not nearly as serious as
influenza or COVID disease.”</p>
<p>HMPV is a common virus that has been around at least since 2001.
Children under five, particularly infants, and adults over 65 —
especially those with health problems — can sometimes become seriously
ill from HMPV. However, for most other people, the symptoms are
generally mild.</p>
<p>“Almost everyone has been infected with this virus by the age of
five,” Auwaerter says. “HMPV has been here for, you know, a long time
[and] has infected millions of people that already have immunity. It’s
not as though this is a brand-new virus that might cause devastating
problems.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, China said cases of HMPV had declined among residents in
its northern provinces, where the respiratory infections were rising.
Chinese health officials say the number of patients seeking medical help
remains lower compared to the same period last year. Still, some health
experts are calling for more transparency in order to reduce the spread
of rumors and misunderstandings.</p>
<p>“International scholars are calling on China to disclose pathogen
information and conduct genetic research to confirm that it is not a new
virus. Even if it is an old virus, it could still be a new variant,”
Dr. Ho Mei-Shang, a research fellow emeritus at the Institute of
Biomedical Sciences in Taipei, told VOA’s Mandarin Service.</p>
<p>Ho said China’s COVID-19 prevention measures during the pandemic
curbed the spread of diseases, which led to a decline in herd immunity,
potentially causing the current surge in cases over a short time
period.</p>
<p>Auwaerter agrees.</p>
<p>“They stayed home, refrained from work, wore masks,” he says. “So,
the usual cycles of acquiring an infection, for example, during the
respiratory season of winter, people didn’t get infected. So, their
specific immunity, they weren’t boosted, and so there was a larger
population that might be more susceptible.”</p>
<p>There is no real treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Doctors say any
patients who have trouble breathing should seek medical help.</p>
<p>Chan-Long Ku of VOA’s Mandarin Service contributed to this
report.</p>

id="trump-says-he-will-create-an-external-revenue-service-agency-to-collect-tariff-income">Trump
says he will create an ‘External Revenue Service’ agency to collect
tariff income</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans
to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect
tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations.</p>
<p>“We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade,
and they will start paying,” Trump said Tuesday on his social media
site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal
Revenue Service, which is the nation’s domestic tax collector.</p>
<p>The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and
Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be
creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing
agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border
Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations.</p>
<p>The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his
Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task
force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and
slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his “Save America”
agenda for a second term in the White House.</p>
<p>Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are
leading the DOGE’s ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the
federal government.</p>
<p>Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from
allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a
benchmark of Trump’s economic agenda as he heads into his second
term.</p>
<p>Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to
consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a
mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote
prosperity.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue
Service plan.</p>
<p>“No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is
planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small
businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,” Oregon
Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said
in a statement.</p>

Cabinet choice faces tough first day of questions on Capitol Hill</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S.
Department of Defense, told U.S. lawmakers Tuesday he would bring back
accountability and “a warrior ethos” to the nation’s military.</p>
<p>In the first confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate for Trump’s
Cabinet secretary picks, Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats
over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the
military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and
financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he
led.</p>
<p>“This nomination is unconventional. The nominee is unconventional,
just like that New York developer who rode down the escalator in 2015 to
announce his candidacy for president,” Senate Armed Services Chairman
Roger Wicker, a Republican, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the
bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the
military’s core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must
fight,” Wicker continued.</p>
<p>Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News
channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last
30 years,” Hegseth told senators in his opening statement. “But as
President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the
Pentagon with the supposed right credentials, whether they are retired
generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it
gotten us?”</p>
<p>Hegseth said his priorities, if he is confirmed as secretary of
defense, would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the
homeland while reorienting the United States away from entanglements in
the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity
initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based
military.</p>
<p>“Getting anything that doesn’t contribute to our democracy out of how
decisions are made inside the Pentagon,” Hegseth said of the ways he
sees his potential role. “What gender you are, what race you are, your
views on climate change, your conscience and your faith should have no
bearing on whether you get promoted, or whether you’re selected to go to
West Point, or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is
how capable are you at your job. How excellent are you at your job.”</p>
<p>If confirmed, Hegseth would be the first secretary of defense to have
served as a junior officer on the front lines and the first secretary
from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits
benefiting military veterans with fewer than 100 employees was not
sufficient experience.</p>
<p>“We’re hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest
organizations in the world. We’re the board of directors here. I don’t
know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that
said, you know, I supervised 100 people before,” said Democratic Senator
Gary Peters.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense has more than 3 million service members and
a budget of $857 billion.</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee, said that the
FBI background investigation into Hegseth was “insufficient” and that
there are still FBI obligations to talk to people.”</p>
<p>“You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the
position of defense,” Reed said, noting that he has voted for all nine
previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during
Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics
review.</p>
<p>Hegseth faces allegations of financial mismanagement of the two
nonprofits where he served as executive director: Vets for Freedom and
Concerned Veterans for America.</p>
<p>After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth acknowledged the
organization was $500,000 in debt, and he was demoted. During his time
at Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower
allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement, which
resulted in an investigation and a report.</p>
<p>Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear
campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources.</p>
<p>“We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do
right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us
from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated
in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And what we knew
is, it wasn’t about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump,
who’s had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time,
and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,” Hegseth
said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in
the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done “a very big
about-face in a short period of time” since Trump chose him to serve as
secretary of defense.</p>
<p>“For 12 years, you were quite open about your views, and your views
were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors,
marines, airmen and guardians. Then on Nov. 9, 2024, just 32 days after
your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in
combat, you declare that ‘some of our greatest warriors are women,’”
Warren said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support in favor of
Hegseth’s nomination.</p>
<p>“These women represent diverse viewpoints, from a retired colonel
with over 25 years of service to an active-duty Navy Surface Warfare
commander to a senior for Mr. Hegseth, and comment on his focus on merit
war-fighting readiness, military training status and the warrior ethos,”
Wicker said.</p>
<p>Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles
during his tenure as secretary of defense.</p>
<p>“Given the standards remain high, and we’ll have a review to ensure
standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,” he said.</p>
<p>Hegseth also faces allegations of sexual assault and public
drunkenness during his time at Fox News.</p>
<p>Cabinet nominees must receive a majority of votes to be confirmed.
The U.S. Senate is composed of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two
independents.</p>

Economic Forum says Trump to take part virtually in Davos meeting, days
after inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — U.S. President Donald Trump will take part virtually in the
World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos just days after his
inauguration, the forum president said Tuesday. </p>
<p>Borge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who heads the
Geneva-based organization, noted that Trump had twice attended the elite
gathering of business, government and other leaders in person during his
first term. </p>
<p>“On Thursday afternoon, he will join us digitally, online, live in a
dialogue with our participants,” Brende told reporters Tuesday as he
presented the five-day program that will start Monday — the day of
Trump’s inauguration. </p>
<p>“We think that will be a very special moment,” he added, notably to
help learn the administration’s “policy priorities.” </p>
<p>Brende said he didn’t know whether Elon Musk, the multibillionaire
who is poised to co-lead Trump’s new Department of Government
Efficiency, would attend, but said the forum expects “additional,
high-level representation” from the administration once confirmation
processes for Trump’s nominees get underway in the U.S. Senate as early
as Monday. </p>
<p>Forum organizers say a record of around 900 business leaders,
including from important emerging markets, will take part in the annual
meeting this year, which is expected to draw nearly 3,000 participants
from over 130 countries. </p>
<p>With climate change, war, global tensions, economic uncertainty and
other issues in mind, Brende acknowledged that the 55th annual meeting
of the forum will take place “against the most complicated geopolitical
backdrop in generations.” </p>
<p>“But still in that fragmented and partly polarized world, there are
still areas where we can collaborate and … we have big opportunities and
responsibilities to find those areas where there is a possibility to
improve the state of the world,” he said. The theme of this year’s
edition is “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age” — a nod to the
growing importance of technology in the world. </p>
<p>The WEF has long been derided as a gathering of world elites who plot
the future at a cushy, snow-bound powwow in the Swiss Alps. Critics
often argue the developing world gets less attention than global powers
and big business in the West or Gulf states. </p>
<p>Forum managing director Mirek Dusek insisted that the number of
businesses from developing countries in the “Global South” was growing,
and the attendance of their leaders was “on parity” with the
participation of leaders in the developed world. </p>
<p>Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Union’s executive
commission, plans to attend the opening day of meetings on Tuesday,
after an introductory gala the night before. Other top envoys include
President Javier Milei of Argentina, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South
Africa, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang. </p>
<p>The vast array of topics will include the future of Syria — its new
foreign minister is expected to attend — after the fall of President
Bashar al-Assad last month; the fight against climate change; the
threats and promise of artificial intelligence; global trade and
economic growth; and wars in places like Ukraine, Sudan and beyond. </p>
<p>“We are ready to roll up our sleeves to make the best out of a
situation where we are faced with many, many challenges,” Brende
said.</p>

<li>Supreme Court rejects Utah lawsuit that threatened public lands
</h3>
<p>
On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear a lawsuit brought by Utah
attempting to seize control of the “unappropriated” federal lands in the
state. Opponents argued that the lawsuit, if successful, would have put
public lands across the West on the path to privatization since Utah and
other states likely couldn’t afford to manage them and would have had to
sell off much of them. However, “while the Court’s decision denying
original review of Utah’s claims is welcome news for our shared public
lands, we fully expect Utah’s misguided attacks to continue,” Alison
Flint, the senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, said in a

hold energy companies accountable for causing “a substantial portion” of

issues executive order for building AI data centers on federal land</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>— U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order Tuesday
directing the development of artificial intelligence data centers on six
federal land sites, with a special focus on powering them with clean
energy and upholding high labor standards. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that the United States is the world leader
in AI, but cannot take that lead for granted. </p>
<p>“We will not let America be out-built when it comes to the technology
that will define the future, nor should we sacrifice critical
environmental standards and our shared efforts to protect clean air and
clean water,” Biden said. </p>
<p>The order calls for the Department of Defense and Department of
Energy to each identify three suitable sites where private companies
will lease the land, pay for the construction and operation of the data
centers and ensure the supply of enough clean energy to fully power the
sites. </p>
<p>The developers will also have to buy “an appropriate share” of
semiconductors produced in the United States to help ensure there is a
“robust domestic semiconductor supply chain,” the White House said. </p>
<p>In addition to identifying the sites, the federal government will
also commit under the order to expedite the permitting process for the
data center construction. </p>
<p>Senior administration officials, in a phone call with journalists
previewing the order, highlighted the national security need for the
United States to have its own powerful AI infrastructure, both to
protect it for its own use but also to prevent adversaries such as China
from possessing those capabilities. </p>
<p>“From the national security standpoint, it’s really critical to find
a pathway for building the data centers and power infrastructure to
support frontier AI operations here in the United States to ensure that
the most powerful AI models continue to be trained and stored securely
here in the United States,” an official said. </p>
<p>A senior administration official cited the priority of making sure
the AI industry had an anchor in the United States to avoid repeating
the history of other technologies that moved offshore to areas with
lower labor and environmental standards as well. </p>
<p>AI chip restrictions </p>
<p>Tuesday’s order comes a day after the Biden administration announced
new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial
intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the
interactions of users with AI systems.    </p>
<p>The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments,
comes in response to what administration officials described as a need
to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which
companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging
technology in order to promote innovation.   </p>
<p>“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every
business application in every industry around the world, with enormous
potential for enhanced productivity and societal, health care and
economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters.
“That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national
security become even more intense.”   </p>
<p>A senior administration official said the new rule will not include
any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom
or the United States.   </p>
<p>The rules build on 2023 curbs limiting the export of certain AI chips
to China, a strategic competitor in the production of advanced
semiconductors. Beijing attacked the new U.S. AI edict as a “flagrant
violation” of international trade rules.  </p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Commerce said the Biden administration
announcement “is another example of the generalization of the concept of
national security and the abuse of export control, and a flagrant
violation of international multilateral economic and trade rules.”  </p>
<p>Beijing said it would “take necessary measures to firmly safeguard
its legitimate rights and interests.” </p>
<p>Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to
export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration
official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of
the most powerful closed weight AI models.    </p>
<p>The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from
a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according
to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a
closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open
weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using
to make its decisions.    </p>
<p>Most countries — those not included in the closed partner or arms
embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the
equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available,
nor for any less advanced chips.   </p>
<p>Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face
restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems,
provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior
administration official said.</p>

braces for Trump inauguration with fortress-like fencing, extra
police</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — With 48 km of tall black temporary fencing, 25,000 law
enforcement officers and security checkpoints set up to process hundreds
of thousands of spectators, Washington is braced for President-elect
Donald Trump’s inauguration next week.</p>
<p>The Monday swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and parade to
the White House will follow a weekend featuring protests by Trump’s
opponents and parties and rallies by the Republican’s supporters.</p>
<p>The inauguration follows a campaign marked by two attempts on Trump’s
life — including one from a would-be assassin who nicked his ear with a
bullet — and a pair of New Year’s Day attacks on ordinary Americans. In
one, 14 people were killed and dozens injured when a U.S. Army veteran
rammed a truck into a crowd of New Year’s Eve revelers in New Orleans.
The same day, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier detonated a Tesla
Cybertruck outside a Trump-branded hotel in Las Vegas, killing
himself.</p>
<p>“We are in a higher-threat environment,” said U.S. Secret Service
Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool at a Monday press briefing.</p>
<p>The inauguration itself, when Trump formally takes the oath of office
with members of Congress, the Supreme Court, his incoming administration
and tens of thousands of others looking on, will take place on the
Capitol steps, facing the Washington Monument.</p>
<p>That is the same spot where, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump
supporters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers
running for their lives in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss
to Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2024 election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris,
conceded her defeat in the Nov. 5 contest, unlike Trump who continues to
falsely maintain that his loss was the result of fraud.</p>
<p>Fear of lone wolf</p>
<p>Security officials said they were not aware of any specific,
coordinated threats to the inauguration. What they are worried about is
lone wolves, such as the New Orleans attacker, or two separate incidents
last week. In one, a man was arrested for trying to bring a machete into
the Capitol. In the other, a man was arrested for trying to ignite a
fire near the Capitol, according to U.S. Capitol Police.</p>
<p>“That threat of the lone actor remains the biggest justification for
us being at this heightened state of alert throughout the next week,”
U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told the security briefing.</p>
<p>The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned police
nationwide of the risk of copycat attacks similar to the New Orleans
incident.</p>
<p>A large chunk of downtown Washington — stretching about 3 km from the
White House to the Capitol — will be closed to vehicular traffic, with
entry points blocked with concrete barriers, garbage trucks and other
heavy items.</p>
<p>The 48 km of 2-meters-tall black fencing, designed to be unclimbable,
will be the longest ever erected in Washington, officials said. Some
7,800 National Guard troops and 4,000 officers brought in from other
police departments around the country will reinforce security.</p>
<p>While some residents of the city, where 90% of voters cast ballots
for Harris over Trump, were readying to leave for the holiday weekend or
hunker down at home to avoid the gridlock, tens of thousands of people
were expected to descend upon the city for celebrations and
protests.</p>
<p>About 70% of Washington’s 34,500 hotel rooms were booked for the
night of the inauguration and the night before as of last week,
according to data from Smith Travel Research and shared with Reuters by
Destination DC, Washington’s official tourism organization. Hotel
occupancy was at about 95% for Trump’s 2017 inauguration, and about 78%
for former President Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013.</p>
<p>Marches and rallies</p>
<p>Trump’s 2017 inauguration was marked by massive protests and
counter-protests. His former spokesman, Sean Spicer, famously began his
tenure by claiming — contrary to photographic evidence — that the crowd
on the grassy National Mall was “the largest audience ever to witness an
inauguration — period.”</p>
<p>The Women’s March the following day drew hundreds of thousands of
people onto the streets of Washington — and even more in pop-up
solidarity events that took place around the country.</p>
<p>A far smaller crowd of 25,000 people is expected to take part in the
anti-Trump People’s March on DC on Saturday, Metropolitan Police Chief
Pamela Smith said on Monday.</p>
<p>Thousands are expected to show up for nearly a dozen other protests
or rallies that local officials have permitted between Saturday and
Monday, including a Trump rally at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who served as
a homeland security official during the Obama administration, said
officials appeared to follow standard practice in planning for all
possibilities.</p>
<p>“What you’re planning for is a worst-case scenario, but my suspicion
is you’re not going to get it, which is good,” Kayyem said. “In terms of
planning, it’s always easier to ratchet down than ratchet up.”</p>

id="winners-of-nobel-and-world-food-prizes-seek-new-ways-to-grow-food">153
winners of Nobel and World Food prizes seek new ways to grow food</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — More than 150 recipients of the Nobel and World
Food prizes released an open letter Tuesday calling for a dramatic
increase in research and a commitment to new food distribution efforts
with a goal of producing more crops and avoiding a global hunger crisis
in coming decades.</p>
<p>The letter notes that an estimated 700 million people now are “food
insecure and desperately poor” but that without a “moonshot” effort to
grow more and different kinds of food, far more people will be in dire
need of food because of climate change and population growth.</p>
<p>“As difficult and as uncomfortable as it might be to imagine,
humanity is headed towards an even more food insecure, unstable world by
mid-century than exists today, worsened by a vicious cycle of conflict
and food insecurity,” states the letter, signed by 153 recipients of the
two prizes. “Climate change is projected to decrease the productivity of
most major staples when substantial increases are needed to feed a world
which will add another 1.5 billion people to its population by
2050.”</p>
<p>Corn production in Africa is expected to decline and much of the
world could see more soil degradation and water shortages, the letter
says.</p>
<p>“We are not on track to meet future food needs. Not even close,” it
adds.</p>
<p>The letter grew from a meeting of food accessibility experts last
fall. Despite the potential gloom, it holds out hope for an optimistic
vision of the future if people take needed actions. The letter says that
a dramatic increase in research funding coupled with more effective ways
to share information and distribute food could prevent a hunger
crisis.</p>
<p>Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2011, said the
need to dramatically increase food production in the coming decades is a
huge challenge. He calls it a “destination with destiny,” but one that
can be achieved with proper funding to enhance existing knowledge as
well as global leadership.</p>
<p>“It is an imminently solvable problem. It is a problem that will
affect billions of people in 25 years. It is a problem that to solve it,
there are no losers, only winners,” Schmidt said in an interview. “All
we have to do is do it.”</p>
<p>Schmidt said he hopes governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere
can commit to solving the problem, but he thinks private groups like the
Gates Foundation may need to take the lead in funding initial steps that
will draw attention and prompt action by politicians.</p>
<p>The letter calls for “transformational efforts” such as enhancing
photosynthesis in essential crops such as wheat and rice, developing
crops that are not as reliant on chemical fertilizers and lengthening
the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate research scientist at NASA who won the
World Food Prize in 2022, said in an interview that researchers are
already making progress toward breakthroughs, but their work needs to be
turbocharged with more funding and emphasis from world leaders.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we have to dream up new solutions,” Rosenzweig said.
“The solutions are very much being tested but in order to actually take
them from the lab out into the agriculture regions of the world, we
really do need the moonshot approach.”</p>
<p>The term moonshot refers to an unprecedented effort, stemming from
President John F. Kennedy’s call in 1962 for Americans to rocket to the
Moon. Rosenzweig, noting she works for NASA, said meeting the food needs
of a growing population will take the kind of commitment the U.S. made
in achieving Kennedy’s goal of reaching the Moon.</p>
<p>“Look at how the scientists had to come together. The engineers had
to be part of it. The funding had to come together as well as the
general public,” she said. “That base of support has to be there as
well.”</p>

special counsel report says prosecutors had enough evidence to convict
Trump in 2020 election case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a report to Congress released early Tuesday, special counsel Jack
Smith said his office had sufficient evidence to “obtain and sustain” a
trial conviction of President-elect Donald Trump for efforts to overturn
Trump’s loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Smith said Trump “resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain
power” after it became clear that he had lost and that legal ways to
challenge the results had failed.</p>
<p>“This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote
counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in
seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and
his own Vice President, Michael R. Pence, to act in contravention of
their oaths and to instead advance Mr. Trump’s personal interests; and,
on January 6 , 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol
to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election
and then leverage rioters,” Smith said in his report.</p>
<p>Smith said Trump acted both in his private capacity as an election
candidate, as well as with the help of multiple co-conspirators, and
that Trump tried to use “the power and authority of the United States
Government in furtherance of his scheme.”</p>
<p>The report further says that Trump’s false claims, such as votes
being cast by large numbers of dead people or ineligible voters, or that
voting machines had changed votes for Trump into votes for Biden, were
“demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false.”</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special
counsel’s work as politically motivated.</p>
<p>He responded to the report’s release early Tuesday with a post on his
Truth Social platform calling Smith “a lamebrain prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the
Political Opponent of his ‘boss,’ Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up
writing yet another ‘Report’ based on information that the Unselect
Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED,
because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty
Nancy Pelosi, and others, were,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump is set to be inaugurated for a new term next week after
defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. During the
2024 campaign, Trump denied he lost the 2020 vote, including in a
September debate with Harris. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s report release came a day after U.S. District Judge Aileen
Cannon cleared the Justice Department to make public the portion of
Smith’s report that dealt with Trump’s efforts to cling to power.</p>
<p>Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the
release of Smith’s full report, which also includes an unreleased
section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified
documents after he left office.</p>
<p>Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling
that Smith was illegally appointed.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad
immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s
efforts in the election interference case.</p>
<p>After Trump defeated Harris, the Justice Department dropped both
cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a
sitting U.S. leader.</p>

id="california-winds-increase-posing-new-wildfire-threats">California
winds increase, posing new wildfire threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Winds increased in Southern California Tuesday morning, posing new
challenges for firefighters trying to extinguish raging, out-of-control
blazes in Los Angeles that have killed at least 24 people and left at
least another 24 missing.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service posted an exceptionally rare red flag
warning for “particularly dangerous” weather that could lead to
“explosive fire growth.”</p>
<p>Forecasters said wind gusts in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could
hit about 70 to 110 kilometers an hour, with the fires also boosted by
low humidity. The same conditions are expected to continue into
Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The winds could strengthen parts of the two major blazes that are
still burning in Los Angeles County, undermining the incremental gains
that firefighters have made in controlling the fires or igniting new
ones.</p>
<p>Authorities said one of the blazes, the Palisades fire, was larger
than 9,300 hectares but only 17% contained as of early Tuesday, while
the Eaton fire, containing more than 5,600 hectares, was 35%
contained.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 people have been forced from their homes and whole
neighborhoods flattened, much like the war zones American television
viewers have become accustomed to seeing in Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour
of the affected areas on Monday with Fire Chief Kristin Crowley, saying,
“The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see
it.”</p>
<p>Anish Mahajan, a Los Angeles County public health official, told
residents to wear N95 or P100 masks if they see high winds dispersing
ash. “Ash is not just dirt,” Mahajan said. “It is hazardous fine
dust.”</p>
<p>One concern is that electrical infrastructure could spark new fires,
as has happened in California wildfires in the past. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power said Monday night that it could shut off
power for customers in areas with high fire risk as a precautionary
measure. Another utility, Southern California Edison, said it had
already shut off power to more than 60,000 customers.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Monday that
firefighters were “absolutely better prepared” than when a series of
wildfires rapidly emerged last week, but that the wind gusts could force
authorities to ground aircraft critical to the firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Such restrictions were in place for part of last week as four major
fires burned. Together, those blazes scorched more than 160 square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Firefighters have brought one fire fully under control, while another
north of Los Angeles was 97% contained.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Monday pledged additional federal support and
said during a briefing at the White House, “We’re going to keep doing
everything possible to help you get through this.”</p>
<p>“It was a heartbreaking weekend for a lot of people in Los Angeles,”
Biden said. “Ash was raining down like snow; homes burned to the ground.
Thousands of those homes are gone. And we learned we lost more of our
fellow Americans. So, let’s say again to the people of Los Angeles,
we’re with you.”</p>
<p>The president also praised the work of emergency responders.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is the City of Angels, and you’re now the angels,” Biden
said. “You’re the angels literally saving people’s lives, and we owe
you.”</p>
<p>Biden said the federal government was providing aid to help with
overtime pay for firefighters, debris removal and temporary shelters. He
said the region will need tens of billions of dollars to recover and
called on Congress to “step up” and provide funding.</p>
<p>Some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested federal aid be
given only with conditions, as they criticized Democratic California
leaders for what they allege is mismanaging water and forest
resources.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has said in recent days that the
state has increased its firefighter force and forest management efforts
since he took office in 2019.</p>
<p>On Monday, a lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims
the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire that began January
7.</p>
<p>Edison acknowledged that fire agencies are investigating whether its
equipment may have started a smaller fire in the area that also occurred
that day.</p>
<p>Authorities have not yet determined an official cause for the
fire.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also was sued on
Monday. The suit claims that the utility failed to properly manage water
supplies critical to fighting the Palisades Fire, which has killed at
least eight people and destroyed thousands of structures, according to
the court filing.</p>

Blue Origin calls off New Glenn launch again, eyes Thursday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Jeff Bezos’ rocket company Blue Origin moved
the launch of its New Glenn rocket from Tuesday to Jan. 16, further
pushing back its inaugural attempt to reach orbit and compete with
SpaceX in the satellite launch market.</p>
<p>The company called off its first scheduled launch on Monday after a
technical issue was encountered in the lead-up to its takeoff.</p>
<p>The three-hour launch window opens at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on
Thursday, Blue Origin said in a post on X.</p>
<p>The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and
faced numerous delays as Elon Musk’s SpaceX grew into an industry
juggernaut with its reusable Falcon 9, the world’s most active
rocket.</p>
<p>New Glenn is more than twice as powerful as a Falcon 9 rocket and has
dozens of customer launch contracts collectively worth billions of
dollars lined up.</p>
<p>The rocket would seek to land New Glenn’s first stage booster on a
sea-fairing barge in the Atlantic Ocean 10 minutes after liftoff, while
the rocket’s second stage continues toward orbit.</p>
<p>“The thing we’re most nervous about is the booster landing,” Bezos,
who founded Blue Origin in 2000, told Reuters in a pre-launch interview
on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Clearly on a first flight you could have an anomaly at any mission
phase, so anything could happen.”</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-utahs-push-to-wrest-control-of-public-land-from-the-federal-government">Supreme
Court rejects Utah’s push to wrest control of public land from the
federal government</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned back a push by the
state of Utah to wrest control of vast areas of public land from the
federal government, marking a small victory for land conservation
advocates who worry that similar efforts may escalate in a
Republican-controlled Washington.</p>
<p>The high court refused to let the GOP-controlled state file a lawsuit
seeking to bring the land and its resources under state control. The
decision came in a brief order in which the court did not explain its
reasoning, as is typical. It marks the latest roadblock for states in a
running feud with the U.S. government over who should control huge
swaths of the West and the enormous oil and gas, timber, and other
resources they contain.</p>
<p>Utah’s top state leaders said they have not ruled out taking their
lawsuit to a lower court.</p>
<p>In the Western state known for its rugged mountains popular with
skiers and red-rock vistas that draw throngs of tourists, federal
agencies control almost 70% of the land. Utah argues that local control
would be more responsive and allow the state access to revenue from
taxes and development projects.</p>
<p>The complaint sought control of about half of federal land, which
still amounts to an area nearly as large as South Carolina. The parcels
are used for things like energy production, grazing, mining and
recreation. Utah’s world-famous national parks and national monuments
would have stayed in federal hands.</p>
<p>Monday’s decision by the high court comes as the newly
Republican-controlled Congress adopted a rules package that includes
language allowing lawmakers to more easily transfer or sell off public
lands managed by federal agencies. The rules consider public lands to
have no monetary value, meaning lawmakers will no longer need to account
for lost revenue if they decide to give parcels to states or extractive
industries.</p>
<p>While conservationists applauded the court’s rejection of what they
called a land-grab lawsuit, many remained worried that the efforts will
continue.</p>
<p>Public lands under state control could be vulnerable to
privatization, degradation and oil drilling, said Steve Bloch, legal
director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.</p>
<p>“If successful, Utah’s lawsuit would result in the sale of millions
of acres of public lands in red-rock country to the highest bidder, an
end to America’s system of federal public lands and the dismantling of
the American West as we know it,” Bloch said.</p>
<p>Utah’s Republican Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis criticized the
court’s decision and promised legislative action. Curtis, who campaigned
on being a climate-conscious Republican, said the people of Utah should
be entrusted to manage the land they have lived on for generations.</p>
<p>“Building roads, moving cattle and cleaning up campgrounds all
require navigating a behemothic bureaucracy that’s stacked up against
the average Utahn,” Curtis said.</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Utah’s Republican legislative leaders and
attorney general, Gov. Spencer Cox said he was disappointed in the
court’s decision to turn away the lawsuit.</p>
<p>“Utah remains able and willing to challenge any BLM land management
decisions that harm Utah,” state leaders said. “We are also heartened to
know the incoming administration shares our commitments to the principle
of ‘multiple use’ for these federal lands and is committed to working
with us to improve land management.”</p>
<p>While lawsuits typically start in federal district courts and
eventually work their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, disputes
involving states can start at the nation’s highest court if the justices
agree to hear them.</p>
<p>Utah leaders noted that the high court did not comment on the merits
of their arguments or prevent them from filing the lawsuit in a federal
district court. Conservation groups say they’ll remain ready to
challenge any future lawsuits.</p>
<p>“This lawsuit is an assault on the country’s long-standing and
successful history of safeguarding valuable and vulnerable landscapes in
trust for all Americans,” said Chris Hill, who leads the Conservation
Lands Foundation. “And while the Supreme Court’s decision to not hear
the case is a reprieve, we fully expect this small group of anti-public
lands politicians to continue to waste taxpayer dollars and shop their
bad ideas.”</p>
<p>The federal Bureau of Land Management declined to comment.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
As wildfires continue to burn in Los Angeles, some wealthy residents are
shelling out thousands each day to hire private firefighters to protect
their homes and businesses. But some argue that the market for these
private crews diminishes public firefighting resources. We’ll get into
it. And, renowned science fiction author Octavia Butler predicted many
of our modern problems, including catastrophic wildfires. We’ll explain
how looking to the past helped her write about the future. Plus,

agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public
safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New
Year’s Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people.</p>
<p>The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s
Jan. 20 inauguration.</p>
<p>“The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory
attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for
aspiring violent extremist attackers,” the agencies said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Early on New Year’s Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a
dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a
crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had
pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings
condemning music, drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign “terrorist”
organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using
rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles.</p>
<p>Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to
supplement a vehicle attack, they said.</p>
<p>The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law
enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are
accessible from roadways.</p>
<p>“We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or
retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law
enforcement,” they said.</p>

<h2 id="trumps-offshore-wind-ban-is-coming-congressman-says">Trump’s
Offshore Wind Ban Is Coming, Congressman Says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcwNTQxNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzIwMDk3OH0.wft2_GHYlcqQacJy1St1ECcxMlHuyju9qMBSrPuivME/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
President-elect Donald Trump’s team is drafting an executive order to
“halt offshore wind turbine activities” along the East Coast, working
with the office of Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, the
congressman said in a press release from his office Monday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“This executive order is just the beginning,” Van Drew said in a
statement. “We will fight tooth and nail to prevent this offshore wind
catastrophe from wreaking havoc on the hardworking people who call our
coastal towns home.”
</p>
<p>
The announcement indicates that some in the anti-wind space are leaving
open the possibility that Trump’s much-hyped offshore wind ban may be
less sweeping than initially suggested.
</p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://vandrew.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=4WCDH2I7AJH54" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
press release</u></a>, Van Drew’s office said the executive order would
“lay the groundwork for permanent measures against the projects,”
leaving the door open to only a temporary pause on permitting new
projects. The congressman had
<a href="https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/01/nj-rep-jeff-van-drew-drafts-trump-executive-order-freezing-offshore-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
told</u></a> New Jersey reporters that he anticipates only a six-month
moratorium on offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
The release also stated that the “proposed order” is “expected to be
finalized within the first few months of the administration,” which is a
far cry from Trump’s promise to stop projects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>on
Day 1</u></a>. If enacted, a pause would essentially halt
<em><em>all</em></em> U.S. offshore wind development because the
sought-after stretches of national coastline are entirely within federal
waters.
</p>
<p>
Whether this is just caution from Van Drew’s people or a true moderation
of Trump’s ambition we’ll soon find out. Inauguration Day is in less
than a week.

</p>
<p>
Aerial firefighters don’t have to imagine this terrifying scenario;
they’ve lived it. Last week, a drone punched a hole in the wing of a
Québécois “Super Scooper” plane that had
<a href="https://skiesmag.com/news/quebec-cl-415-super-scooper-may-resume-flying-today-after-drone-strike-repairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traveled

an agonizing half-hour</u></a>. Thirty minutes might not seem like much,
but it is precious time lost when the Santa Ana winds have already
curtailed aerial operations.
</p>
<p>
“I am shocked by what happened in Los Angeles with the drone,” Anna Lau,
a forestry communication coordinator with the Montana Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation, told me. The Montana DNRC has also
had to contend with
<a href="https://www.ypradio.org/wildfire/2022-09-01/drone-complicates-response-to-fire-west-of-helena" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unauthorized
drones grounding its firefighting planes</u></a>. “We’re following
what’s going on very closely, and it’s shocking to us,” Lau went on.
Leaving the skies clear so that firefighters can get on with their work
“just seems like a no-brainer, especially when people are actively
trying to tackle the situation at hand and fighting to save homes,
property, and lives.”

Although the Super Scooper collision was by far the most egregious case,
according to authorities there have been at least 40 “incidents
involving drones” in the airspace around L.A. since the fires started.
(Notably, the Federal Aviation Administration has not granted any
waivers for the air space around Palisades, meaning any drone images you
see of the region, including on the news, were “probably shot
illegally,”
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/los-angeles-firefighters-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Intelligencer</em></em></u><u>
reports</u></a>.) So far, law enforcement has arrested three people
<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5082600-unauthorized-drone-flights-double-in-southern-california-3-arrested-during-la-fires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>connected
to drones flying</u></a> near the L.A. fires, and the FBI is
<a href="https://x.com/FBIMostWanted/status/1878910193259454890" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking
information</u></a> regarding the Super Scooper collision.
</p>
<p>
Such a problem is hardly isolated to these fires, though. The Forest
Service reports that drones led to the suspension of or interfered with
<a href="https://richmondobserver.com/local-news/forest-service-agencies-reminding-residents-across-the-state-to-keep-drones-away-from-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
least 172 fire responses</u></a> between 2015 and 2020. Some people,
including Mike Fraietta, an FAA-certified drone pilot and the founder of
the drone-detection company Gargoyle Systems, believe the true number of
interferences is much higher — closer to 400.
</p>

Law enforcement likes to say that unauthorized drone use falls into
three buckets —
<a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/unauthorized-drone-usage-in-double-digits-amid-socals-firefight/3602131/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clueless,
criminal, or careless</u></a> — and Fraietta was inclined to believe
that it’s mostly the former in L.A. Hobbyists and other casual drone
operators “don’t know the regulations or that this is a danger,” he
said. “There’s a lot of ignorance.” To raise awareness, he suggested law
enforcement and the media highlight the steep penalties for flying
drones in wildfire no-fly zones, which is punishable

up to</u></a> 12 months in prison or a fine of $75,000.
</p>
<p>
“What we’re seeing, particularly in California, is TikTok and Instagram
influencers trying to get a shot and get likes,” Fraietta conjectured.
In the case of the drone that hit the Super Scooper, it “might have been
a case of citizen journalism, like, <em><em>Well, I have the ability to
get this shot and share what’s going on</em></em>.”
</p>
<p>
Emergency management teams are waking up, too. Many technologies are on
the horizon for drone detection, identification, and deflection,
including Wi-Fi jamming, which was used to
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/london-heathrow-appears-jam-drone-signals-stop-climate-protests-2019-9#:~:text=for%20more%20stories.-,London's%20Heathrow%20Airport%20appears%20to%20have%20worked%20out%20how%20to,protesters%20from%20disrupting%20its%20airspace.&text=Activists%20from%20the%20group%20Heathrow,that%20most%20did%20not%20work." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ground
climate activists’ drones</u></a> at Heathrow Airport in 2019. Jamming
is less practical in an emergency situation like the one in L.A.,
though, where lives could be at stake if people can’t communicate.
</p>
<p>
Still, the fact of the matter is that firefighters waste precious time
dealing with drones when there are far more pressing issues that need
their attention. Lau, in Montana, described how even just a 12-minute
interruption to firefighting efforts can put a community at risk. “The
biggest public awareness message we put out is, ‘If you fly, we can’t,’”
she said.
</p>
<p>
Fraietta, though, noted that drone
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/los-angeles-fires-tech" target="_self"><u>technology
could be used positively in the future</u></a>, including on wildfire
detection and monitoring,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/drone-amplified-field-tech-lab-wildfires-drones" target="_self"><u>prescribed
burns</u></a>, and communicating with firefighters
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/new-york-disaster-drones" target="_self"><u>or
victims</u></a> on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to see this turn into the FAA saying, ‘Hey everyone, no
more drones in the United States because of this incident,’” Fraietta
said. “You don’t shut down I-95 because a few people are running drugs
up and down it, right? Drones are going to be super beneficial to the
country long term.”
</p>
<p>
But critically, in the case of a wildfire, such tools belong in the
<em><em>right</em></em> hands — not the hands of your neighbor who got a
DJI Mini 3 for Christmas. “Their one shot isn’t worth it,” Lau said.

id="millions-have-had-student-loans-canceled-under-biden-despite-collapse-of-his-forgiveness-plan">Millions
have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his
forgiveness plan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student
loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation
of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other
president in U.S. history.</p>
<p>In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled
loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden
took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to
their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the
Supreme Court rejected Biden’s plan for a new forgiveness policy.</p>
<p>“My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of
student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of
students across the country,” Biden said in a written statement.</p>
<p>In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in
student loans.</p>
<p>The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald
Trump takes office. Trump hasn’t detailed his student loan policies but
previously called cancellation “vile” and illegal. Republicans have
fought relentlessly against Biden’s plans, saying cancellation is
ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already
repaid their loans.</p>
<p>Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness</p>
<p>The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as
borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if
they’re cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but
rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals
during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers
with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was
created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in
a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments.</p>
<p>Most of Monday’s borrower defense cancellations were for students who
attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in
Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and
Independence University. They are based on past findings that the
schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects
and the terms of private loans.</p>
<p>Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates
who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief.
The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory
power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through
Congress.</p>
<p>As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled
through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration
took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors
by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants.</p>
<p>Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out
they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into
forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those
periods didn’t end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed
for cancellation.</p>
<p>The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules
during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a
result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances
zeroed out through the program.</p>
<p>All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden’s
marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief
for more than 40 million Americans.</p>
<p>But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden
administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing
mechanisms.</p>
<p>Republicans have called for a different approach</p>
<p>Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as
conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power.
Republican states fought off Biden’s later attempts at mass forgiveness,
but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal
challenge.</p>
<p>As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White
House, Biden’s changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it’s
unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the
cancellation spigot.</p>
<p>Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but
Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the
Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and
narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than
existing ones.</p>

<h2 id="elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant">Elon
Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his
brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working
to connect the nervous system to machines.</p>
<p>“We’ve got … three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,”
he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event
streamed on his social media platform X.</p>
<p>Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company
has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and
longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the
experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.</p>
<p>Musk didn’t provide any details about the latest patient, but there
are updates on the previous ones.</p>
<p>The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the
implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the
device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create
3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord
injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.</p>
<p>But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many
other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two
studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how
brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate
better.</p>
<p>Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology?</p>
<p>More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway,
according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at
helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other
uses.</p>
<p>Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately
control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the
Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant
the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible
electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and
control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than
other interfaces.</p>
<p>Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be
shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For
example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and
Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either
less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural
recording with stimulation.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of BCIs?</p>
<p>Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher &amp;
Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with
potential benefits to people with paralysis.</p>
<p>Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the
winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.”</p>
<p>Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research
teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any
money to Neuralink.</p>
<p>“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is
clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be.
We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said.</p>
<p>How are BCIs tested and regulated?</p>
<p>Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S.
regulators to begin testing its device in people.</p>
<p>While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies,
high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an
“investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug
Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University
of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.</p>
<p>Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t
confirm or disclose information about a particular study.</p>
<p>Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from
recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this
regulatory process prioritizes safety.</p>
<p>She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research
involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can
also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics
committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as
someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the
board.</p>
<p>The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and
reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those
before they enroll,” said Redberg.</p>

id="biden-defends-foreign-policy-record-despite-ongoing-crises">Biden
defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his
foreign policy record on Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker
than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that
remain unresolved.</p>
<p>A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden
addressed U.S. diplomats at the State Department and touted his
administration’s backing for Ukraine against Russia’s 2022 invasion and
for Israel’s wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Biden said the United States was “winning the worldwide competition”
and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted,
while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S.
involvement.</p>
<p>“Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are
stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,” Biden said. “We
have not gone to war to make these things happen.”</p>
<p>While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials
hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can
be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free
hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the
Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>“So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have
been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace, a right to determine
their own futures. Israel deserves peace and real security. The hostages
and their families deserve to be reunited,” Biden said. “And so we’re
working urgently to close this deal.”</p>
<p>Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and
diplomatic support, since the latest bloodshed in the decades-old
Israeli Palestinian conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked
Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to
Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Israel’s subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 46,000
Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also drawing
accusations of genocide in a World Court case brought by South Africa
and of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the International
Criminal Court. Israel denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The assault has displaced nearly Gaza’s entire 2.3 million population
and drawn the concern of the world’s main hunger monitor.</p>
<p>Protesters shouting “war criminal” greeted Biden outside the State
Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid
intended to look like blood.</p>
<p>Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries including Hamas in
Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president
also hailed Washington’s support for Israel during two Iranian attacks
in 2024.</p>
<p>“All told, Iran is weaker than it’s been in decades,” he added,
noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. “There’s no question
that our actions contributed significantly.”</p>
<p>Authoritarian alliance</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged that authoritarian states China, Iran, North Korea
and Russia were now more closely aligned with one another, but he said
that was more “out of weakness than out of strength.”</p>
<p>Ukraine, with U.S. backing, had thwarted Russian President Vladimir
Putin’s goal of wiping the country off the map, Biden said, touting his
2023 visit to Kyiv as the first by a sitting president to a war zone
outside the control of U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he (could) conquer Kyiv in a
matter of days. Truth is, since that war began, I’m the only one that
stood in the center of Kyiv, not him,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, writing on
Telegram, said Biden’s address amounted to an acknowledgement “that U.S.
support for Kyiv created the risk of triggering a nuclear confrontation
with Russia.”</p>
<p>“Today’s statement by Biden is an admission of a deliberately
executed provocation,” Zakharova wrote. “The Biden administration knew
it was pushing the world toward the brink and still chose to escalate
the conflict.”</p>
<p>Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan,
saying there was nothing adversaries like China and Russia would have
liked more than seeing the United States continue to be tied down there
for another decade.</p>
<p>Biden said when he entered the White House, experts predicted it was
inevitable that China would surpass the United States in economic terms.
Now, he predicted, that will never happen. He said the U.S. economy was
moving forward, but there was still work to do.</p>
<p>“Now, make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States
must continue to deal with,” Biden said, including in Ukraine, the
Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. He said the Biden administration was
leaving the next administration “a very strong hand to play.”</p>

id="baltimore-prosecutors-back-adnan-syeds-request-to-have-his-sentence-reduced-to-time-served">Baltimore
prosecutors back Adnan Syed’s request to have his sentence reduced to
time served</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting
Adnan Syed’s recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served,
which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further
court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large
following from the hit podcast “Serial.”</p>
<p>Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge
to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school
ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee’s family later led
to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme
Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about
vacating the conviction.</p>
<p>Last month, Syed’s attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence
to be reduced under Maryland’s relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act,
which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as
minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was
passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open
to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive
development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when
Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.</p>
<p>Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on
Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>In it, State’s Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed’s request is “in the
interest of justice.”</p>
<p>“I truly believe Mr. Syed’s case is precisely what legislators
envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act,” Bates said
in a statement Monday. “We have an individual who has served over 20
years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed
tremendous personal growth and reform.”</p>
<p>But attorneys for the Lee family argue it’s premature to consider a
sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in
the air.</p>
<p>“That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be
resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed’s sentence can be
considered,” attorney David Sanford said in a statement. “Currently
Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed
has ever presented calls that fact into question.”</p>
<p>The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more
recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of
crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a
growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as
systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.</p>
<p>Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown
University’s Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his
aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October
after a long illness.</p>
<p>“He cares so much about our family,” his mother wrote in a recent
letter to the court. “He is married and tries to be the best husband he
can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried
hard to become a positive member of his community.”</p>
<p>Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many
questions about the case remain unanswered even after the “Serial”
podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and
interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of
listeners who became armchair detectives.</p>
<p>Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed,
43, has shown he doesn’t pose a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>“In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the
seriousness of the crime in this case,” the motion says. “The State,
however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a
crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have
been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society.”</p>
<p>But the motion doesn’t present a position on Syed’s conviction
itself.</p>
<p>The Maryland Supreme Court’s 4-3 ruling in August called for a new
hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim’s
relatives didn’t receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the
original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom.</p>
<p>Bates, who took office as state’s attorney a few months after the
2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court’s
decision. But if Syed’s motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he
would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.</p>

interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a
court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is
set to take office again.</p>
<p>But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the
report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it’s unlikely Judge Aileen
Cannon’s order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may
seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing
the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigations
into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon’s latest
order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump’s
2020 election interference case.</p>
<p>She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to
lawmakers the volume on Trump’s classified documents case. The
department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as
criminal proceedings against two of Trump’s co-defendants remain
pending.</p>
<p>Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report
to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in
a footnote in a court filing over the weekend.</p>
<p>The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn
additional details in the coming days about Trump’s frantic but
ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6,
2021, insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election
interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing
with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump’s
hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach,
Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect’s two co-defendants,
Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De
Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them
given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form
of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon’s dismissal of charges.</p>
<p>As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make
that document public but would instead share it with select
congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted
those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>“All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns
this criminal proceeding,” she wrote. “All parties also appear to agree
that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair
trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of
Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency
of criminal proceedings.”</p>

designates extreme right-wing ‘Terrorgram’ network as terrorist
group</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme
right-wing online network, designating the “Terrorgram” collective a
terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white
supremacy. </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated
the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site,
and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. </p>
<p>The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated
attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting
outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy
facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in
Turkey. </p>
<p>“The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on
perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials
on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical
infrastructure and government officials,” the State Department
said. </p>
<p>The action freezes any of the group’s U.S. assets and bars Americans
from dealing with it. </p>
<p>The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil,
Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. </p>
<p>In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two
alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit
attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of
inciting a race war. </p>
<p>Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as
a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in
the country to belong to or promote the group. </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in
office. </p>
<p>In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for
Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and
prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining
dangerous groups.</p>

Los Angeles?</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
As Los Angeles continued to battle multiple big blazes ripping through
some of the most beloved (and expensive) areas of the city on Friday, a
question lingered in the background: What caused the fires in the first
place?
</p>
<p>
Though fires are less common in California during this time of the year,
they aren’t unheard of. In early December 2017, power lines sparked the
Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, which burned through to
mid-January. At the time it was the largest fire in the state since at
least the 1930s. Now
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s
the ninth-largest</u></a>. Although that fire was in a more rural area,
it ignited for some of the same reasons we’re seeing fires this week.
</p>
<p>
Read on for everything we know so far about how the fires started.
</p>
<h3>
How many fires are burning in Los Angeles County and where are they?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Six major fires started during the Santa Ana wind event last week:
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades, which has burned nearly
24,000 acres, started on Tuesday, January 7, around 10:30 a.m. Pacific
time.
</li>
<li>
The Eaton Fire, north of Pasadena, which has burned more than 14,000
acres, started on Tuesday just after 6:00 p.m.
</li>
<li>
The Hurst Fire, in the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley, which
has burned about 800 acres, started on Tuesday night around 10:30 pm.
</li>
<li>
The Lidia Fire, in Acton, California, just north of Angeles National
Forest, which has burned roughly 400 acres, started on Wednesday
afternoon around 1:00 p.m. As of Saturday morning it was declared 100%
contained.
</li>
<li>
The Sunset Fire, in the Hollywood Hills, which has burned about 43
acres, started on Wednesday night around 5:30 p.m. Evacuation orders
lifted early Thursday morning, when the fire’s “forward progress has
been stopped,” and crews were working to “put out hotspots within the
fire perimeter and keep the wind from spreading embers,”
<a href="https://x.com/PIOErikScott" target="_blank"><u>according to Los
Angeles Fire Department Public Information Officer Erik Scott</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
The Kenneth Fire, in the hills above Calabasas, which burned a little
over 1,000 acres, started on Thursday around 3:30 p.m. As of Sunday
morning it was declared 100% contained.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How did the fires start?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Officials are investigating the cause of the fires and have not made any
public statements yet.
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Early
eyewitness accounts</u></a> suggest that the Eaton Fire may have started
at the base of a transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison.
So far, the company has maintained that an analysis of its equipment
showed “no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until
more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.” A
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/palisades-fire-origin-new-years-eve-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Washington
Post</em></em></u><u> investigation found</u></a> that the Palisades
Fire could have risen from the remnants of a fire that burned on New
Year’s Eve and reignited.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday morning, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from
the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, told me it was unlikely they had
even begun looking into the root of the biggest and most destructive of
the fires in the Pacific Palisades. “They don’t start an investigation
until it’s safe to go into the area where the fire started, and it just
hasn’t been safe until probably today,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It can take years to determine the cause of a fire. Investigators did
not pinpoint the cause of the Thomas Fire until March 2019, more than
two years after it started.
</p>
<p>
But Nordskog doesn’t think it will take very long this time. It’s easier
to narrow down the possibilities for an urban fire because there are
typically both witnesses and surveillance footage, he told me. He said
the most common causes of wildfires in Los Angeles are power lines and
those started by unhoused people. They can also be caused by sparks from
vehicles or equipment.
</p>
<h3>
How do these fires compare to past fires in California?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
At more than 40,000 acres burned total, these fires are unlikely to make
the charts for the
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" target="_blank"><u>largest
in California history</u></a>. But because they are burning in urban,
densely populated, and expensive areas, they could be some of the most
devastating. With an
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated
9,000 structures damaged</u></a> as of Friday morning, the Eaton and
Palisades fires are likely to make the list for
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=9e4974c273274858880c2dd28292a96f&hash=29E21CBFCE8D9885F606246607D21CEB" target="_blank"><u>most
destructive wildfire events</u></a> in the state.
</p>
<p>
And they will certainly be at the top for costliest. The Palisades Fire
has already been declared a likely contender for the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-09/the-costliest-fire-on-record-not-just-for-california" target="_blank"><u>most
expensive wildfire in U.S. history</u></a>. It has destroyed
<a href="https://lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5,000</u></a> structures in some of the most expensive zip codes in
the country. Between that and the Eaton Fire, Accuweather estimates the
damages could reach
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$57
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these fires so bad? Is it climate change?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
While we don’t know the root causes of the ignitions, several factors
came together to create perfect fire conditions in Southern California
this week.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa
Ana winds</u></a>, an annual phenomenon in Southern California, when
very dry, high-pressure air gets trapped in the Great Basin and begins
escaping westward through mountain passes to lower-pressure areas along
the coast. Most of the time, the wind in Los Angeles blows eastward from
the ocean, but during a Santa Ana event, it changes direction, picking
up speed as it rushes toward the sea.
</p>
<p>
Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the US Geological Survey and an
adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles told me
that Santa Ana winds typically blow at maybe 30 to 40 miles per hour,
while the winds this week hit upwards of 60 to 70 miles per hour. “More
severe than is normal, but not unique,” he said. “We had similar severe
winds in 2017 with the Thomas Fire.”
</p>
<p>
Second, Southern California is currently in the midst of extreme
drought. Winter is typically a rainier season, but Los Angeles has seen
less than half an inch of rain since July. That means that all the
shrubland vegetation in the area is bone-dry. Again, Keeley said, this
was not usual, but not unique. Some years are drier than others.
</p>
<p>
These fires were also not a question of fuel management, Keeley told me.
“The fuels are not really the issue in these big fires. It’s the extreme
winds,” he said. “You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have
essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.” As far as he can
tell,
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/b71f526e-4b91-4cdc-99cd-f5e19c80105f" target="_blank"><u>based
on information from CalFire</u></a>, the Eaton Fire started on an urban
street.
</p>
<p>
While it’s likely that climate change played a role in amplifying the
drought, it’s hard to say how big a factor it was. Patrick Brown, a
climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct professor at
Johns Hopkins University, published a long
<a href="https://x.com/PatrickTBrown31/status/1877134442839310573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post
on X</u></a> outlining the factors contributing to the fires, including
a
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/pcp/3/2/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1991&endbaseyear=2020&trend=true&trend_base=10&begtrendyear=1975&endtrendyear=2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a>
of historic rainfall during the winter in Los Angeles that shows
oscillations between wet and dry years over the past eight decades.
</p>
<p>
But climate change is expected to make dry years drier and wet years
wetter, creating a “hydroclimate whiplash,” as Daniel Swain, a
pre-eminent expert on climate change and weather in California puts it.
In a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lfdot3l5dm2o" target="_blank"><u>thread
on Bluesky</u></a>, Swain wrote that “in 2024, Southern California
experienced an exceptional episode of wet-to-dry hydroclimate whiplash.”
Last year’s rainy winter fostered abundant plant growth, and the
proceeding dryness primed the vegetation for fire.

<li>EV leases are booming

<p>
Affordable EV leases are “the car market’s hottest deal,”

to</a> <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em>. Car companies are
changing the way they pitch EVs to buyers, offering short-term leases
with low monthly payments. These deals are attractive to first-time EV
shoppers who are still a little bit hesitant to commit, as well as
people on a tighter budget. Roughly 45% of EV transactions at the end of
2024 were leases, much higher than the auto industry as a whole. And a
provision in the Inflation Reduction Act means leased cars can more
easily qualify for the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit. “The
proliferation of lease deals has made EVs more accessible to buyers who
couldn’t afford their higher sticker prices,” the
<em><em>Journal</em></em> said. “For the automakers, it is helping get
more EVs into customers’ hands after a choppy start for their
electric-car operations.”

<li>Wind power generation could surpass coal in EU
</h3>
<p>
Wind power could overtake coal in Europe for electricity generation for
the first time this year, according to the energy think tank Ember. At
the end of 2024, wind power was closing in on coal, coming in at just 4%
below the fossil fuel in power generation as the continent’s coal plants
close. “That output gap could easily be made up over the course of 2025
by an increase in regional wind generation capacity or by higher average
wind speeds at turbine level, or by some combination of both,”

<p class="drop-caps">
A week ago, forecasters in Southern California warned residents of Los
Angeles that conditions would be dry, windy, and conducive to wildfires.
How bad things have gotten, though, has taken everyone by surprise. As
of Monday morning, almost 40,000 acres of Los Angeles County have burned
in six separate fires, the biggest of which, Palisades and Eaton, have
yet to be fully contained. The latest red flag warning, indicating fire
weather, won’t expire until Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
Many have questions about how the second-biggest city in the country is
facing such unbelievable devastation (some of these questions, perhaps,
being
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
politically motivated</u></a> than others). Below, we’ve tried to
collect as many answers as possible — including a bit of good news about
what lies ahead.
</p>
<h3>
What is the forecast for the week ahead?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
A
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>second
Santa Ana wind event</u></a> is due to set in Monday afternoon. “We’re
expecting moderate Santa Ana winds over the next few days, generally in
the 20 to 30 [mile per hour] range, gusting to 50, across the mountains
and through the canyons,” Eric Drewitz, a meteorologist with the Forest
Service, told me on Sunday. Drewitz noted that the winds will be less
severe than last week’s, when the fires flared up, but he also
anticipates they’ll be “more easterly,” which could blow the fires into
new areas. A new red flag warning has been issued through Wednesday,
signaling increased fire potential due to low humidity and high winds
for several days yet.
</p>
<p>
If firefighters can prevent new flare-ups and hold back the fires
through that wind event, they might be in good shape. By Friday of this
week, “it looks like we could have some moderate onshore flow,” Drewitz
said, when wet ocean air blows inland, which would help “build back the
marine layer” and increase the relative humidity in the region,
<em><em>decreasing</em></em> the chances of more fires. Information
about the Santa Anas at that time is still uncertain — the models have
been changing, and the wind is tricky to predict the strength of so far
out — but an increase in humidity will at least offer some relief for
the battered Ventura and Orange Counties.
</p>
<h3>
What areas have been affected so far?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The Palisades Fire, the biggest in L.A., ripped through the hilly and
affluent area between Santa Monica and Malibu, including the Pacific
Palisades neighborhood,
<a href="https://patch.com/california/pacificpalisades/pacific-palisades-named-2nd-most-expensive-real-estate-market-la" target="_blank"><u>the
second-most expensive zip code</u></a> in Los Angeles and home to many
celebrities. Structures in Big Rock, a neighborhood in Malibu, have also
burned. The fire has also encroached on the I-405 and the Getty Villa,
and destroyed at least two homes in Mandeville Canyon, a neighborhood of
multimillion-dollar homes. Students at nearby University of California,
Los Angeles,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-wildfires-palisades-eaton-california-01-11-25#cm5rwz9p400003b6nxcjozpgn" target="_blank"><u>were
told</u></a> on Friday to prepare for a possible evacuation.
</p>
<p>
The Eaton Fire, the second biggest blaze in the area, has killed 16
people in Altadena, a neighborhood near Pasadena,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises" target="_blank">according
to the
</a><em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises">Los
Angeles Times</a>,</em> making it one of the deadliest fires in the
modern history of California.
</p>
<p>
The 1,000-acre Kenneth fire is 100% contained but still burning near
Calabasas and the gated community of Hidden Hills. The Hurst Fire has
burned nearly 800 acres and is 89% contained and is still burning near
Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood in L.A. Though there are no
evacuation notices for either the Kenneth or the Hurst fires, residents
in the L.A. area should monitor the current conditions as the situation
continues to be fluid and develop.
</p>
<p>
The 43-acre Sunset Fire, which triggered evacuations last week in
Hollywood and Hollywood Hills,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-09/firefighters-make-big-gains-battling-sunset-fire-which-forced-evacuations-in-hollywood" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned
no homes</u></a> and is 100% contained.
</p>
<p>
The Lidia Fire, which ignited in a remote area south of Acton,
California, on Wednesday afternoon, burned 350 acres of brush and is
100% contained.
</p>
<h3>
How did the fires start?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
It can take years to determine the cause of a fire, and investigations
typically don’t begin until after the fire is under control and the area
is safe to reenter, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from
the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1:~:text=How%20did%20the%20fires%20start%3F" target="_self"><u>told
Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</u></a>. He also noted, however, that urban
fires are typically easier to pinpoint the cause of than wildland fires
due to the availability of witnesses and surveillance footage.
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of wildfires, 85%,
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation.htm" target="_blank"><u>are
caused by humans</u></a>.<strong> </strong>So far, investigators have
ruled out lightning — another common fire-starter — because there were
no electrical storms in the area when the fires started. In the case of
the Palisades Fire, there were no power lines in the area of the
ignition, though investigators are now looking into an electrical
transmission tower in Eaton Canyon as
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/la-me-eaton-fire-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
possible cause</u></a> of the deadly fire in Altadena. There have been
rumors that arsonists started the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>fires</u></a>,
but investigators say that scenario is also
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/wildfires/are-arsonists-responsible-los-angeles-wildfires-rcna186949" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty
unlikely</u></a> due to the spread of the fires and how remote the
ignition areas are.
</p>
<h3>
How many people have died?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Officially,
<u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/13/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" target="_blank">24
people have died</a></u>, but that tally is likely to rise. California
Governor Gavin Newsom said Sunday that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/12/los-angeles-fires-california-updates-palisades-eaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
expects “a lot more” deaths</u></a> will be added to the total in the
coming days as search efforts continue.
</p>
<h3>
Why has it been so challenging to put out these fires?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Incoming President Donald Trump slammed the response to the L.A. fires
in
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849" target="_blank"><u>a
Truth Social post</u></a> on Sunday morning: “This is one of the worst
catastrophes in the history of our Country,” he wrote. “They just can’t
put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?”
</p>
<p>
Though
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-wind-forecast" target="_self"><u>there
is much blame</u></a> going around —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation" target="_self"><u>not
all of it founded in reality</u></a> — the challenges facing
firefighters are immense. Last week, because of strong Santa Ana winds,
fire crews could not drop suppressants like water or chemical retardant
on the initial blazes. (In strong winds, water and retardant
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-3349461/Challenging-conditions-crews-wind-takes-fire-retardant-drop.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>will
blow away</u></a> before they reach the flames on the ground.)
</p>
<p>
Fighting a fire in an urban or suburban area
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>is
also different</u></a> from fighting one in a remote, wild area. In a
true wildfire, crews don’t use much water; firefighters typically
contain the blazes by creating breaks — areas cleared of vegetation that
starve a fire of fuel and keep it from spreading. In an urban or
suburban event, however, firefighters can’t simply hack through a
neighborhood, and typically have to use water to fight structure fires.
Their priority also shifts from stopping the fire to evacuating and
saving people, which means putting out the fire itself has to wait.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, the L.A. area faced dangerous fire weather going into last
week — with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour and dry air — and the
persistence of the Santa Ana winds during firefighting operations
through the weekend made it extremely difficult for emergency managers
to gain a foothold.
</p>
<h3>
Is there enough water to fight the fires?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Trump and others have criticized Los Angeles for being unprepared for
the fires, given
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/us/los-angeles-fire-water-hydrant-failure.html" target="_blank"><u>reports</u></a>
that some fire hydrants ran dry or had low pressure during operations in
Pacific Palisades. According to
<a href="https://www.ladwpnews.com/pacific-palisades-fire-correcting-misinformation-about-ladwps-water-system/" target="_blank"><u>the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power</u></a>, about 20% of hydrants
were affected, mostly at higher elevations.
</p>
<p>
The problem isn’t a lack of preparation, however. It’s that the L.A.
wildfires are so large and widespread, the county’s preparations were
quickly overwhelmed. “We’re fighting a wildfire with urban water
systems, and that is really challenging,” Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones said in a news conference last
week. When houses burn down, water mains can break open. Civilians also
put a strain on the system when they use hoses or sprinkler systems to
try to protect their homes.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, Judy Chu, the Democratic lawmaker representing Altadena,
confirmed that fire officials had told her there was
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judy-chu-eaton-fire-altadena-response/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough
water</u></a> to continue the battle in the days ahead. “I believe that
we’re in a good place right now,” she told reporters. Newsom, meanwhile,
has responded to criticism over the water failure by
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-10/newsom-water-fires-investigation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordering
an investigation</u></a> into the weak or dry hydrants.
</p>
<p>
So-called “super soaker” planes have had no problem with water access;
they’re scooping
<a href="https://www.foxla.com/video/1572766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly
from the ocean</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Have aerial firefighting operations resumed?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Yes. Although aerial support was grounded in the early stages of the
wildfires due to severe Santa Ana winds, flights resumed during lulls in
the storms last week.
</p>
<p>
There is a misconception, though, that water and retardant drops “put
out” fires; they don’t. Instead, aerial support suppresses a fire so
crews can get in close and use traditional methods, like cutting a fire
break or spraying water. “All that up in the air, all that’s doing is
allowing the firefighters [on the ground] a chance to get in,” Bobbie
Scopa, a veteran firefighter and author of the memoir
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781641608060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Both
Sides of the Fire Line</em></em></u></a>, told me last week.
</p>
<p>
With winds expected to pick up early this week, aerial firefighting
operations may be grounded again. “If you have erratic, unpredictable
winds to where you’ve got a gust spread of like 20 to 30 knots,” i.e. 23
to 35 miles per hour, “that becomes dangerous,” Dan Reese, a veteran
firefighter and the founder and president of the International Wildfire
Consulting Group, told me on Friday.
</p>
<h3>
Should I be worried about the smoke?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because of the direction of the Santa Ana winds, wildfire smoke should
mostly blow out to sea. But as winds shift, unhealthy air can blow into
populated areas,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-fires-smoke" target="_self"><u>affecting
the health of residents</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Wildfire smoke is unhealthy, period, but urban and suburban smoke like
that from the L.A. fires can be particularly detrimental. It’s not just
trees and brush immolating in an urban fire, it’s also cars, and
batteries, and gas tanks, and plastics, and insulation, and other nasty,
chemical-filled things catching fire and sending fumes into the air.
PM2.5, the inhalable particulates from wildfire smoke, contributes to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-mortality" target="_self"><u>thousands
of excess deaths annually in the U.S.</u></a>

<h3>
When will it rain?
</h3>
<br/>

“The bad news is, I’m not seeing any rain chances,” Drewitz, the Forest
Service meteorologist, told me on Sunday. Though the marine layer will
bring wetter air to the Los Angeles area on Friday, his models showed
it’ll be unlikely to form precipitation.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Though some forecasters have signaled potential rain
<a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/01/11/santa-ana-winds-fires-in-la-ventura-county-weather/77635046007/#:~:text=NWS%20Los%20Angeles%20also%20predicts%20a%2020%25%20chance%20of%20light%20rain%20during%20the%20weekend." target="_blank"><u>at
the end of next week</u></a>, the general consensus is that the odds for
that are low, and that any rain there may be will be
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/increasing-winds-bring-new-fire-dangers-across-l-a-county-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
light or short-lived</u></a> to contribute meaningfully to extinguishing
the fires.
</p>
<h3>
What is the relationship between the L.A. fires and climate change?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The chaparral shrublands around Los Angeles are supposed to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-controlled-burns" target="_self"><u>burn
every 30 to 130 years</u></a>. “There are high concentrations of
terpenes — very flammable oils — in that vegetation; it’s made to burn,”
Scopa, the veteran firefighter, told me.
</p>
<p>
What <em><em>isn’t</em></em> normal, though, is the amount of rain Los
Angeles got ahead of this past spring — 52.46 inches in the preceding
two years,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-01/another-wet-winter-set-record-water-year-second-in-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
wettest period in the city’s history</u></a> since the late 1800s —
which was followed by a blisteringly hot summer and a delayed start to
this year’s rainy season. Since October, parts of Southern California
have
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received
just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a>
</p>
<p>
This “weather whiplash” is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>caused
by a warmer atmosphere</u></a>, which means that plants will grow
explosively due to the influx of rain and then dry out when the drought
returns, leaving lots of dry fuels ready and waiting for a spark. “This
is really, I would argue, a signature of climate change that is going to
be experienced almost everywhere people actually live on Earth,” Daniel
Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles,
who authored a new study on the pattern,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/09/california-fires-wet-dry-weather-conditions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>The Washington Post</em></em></u></a>.
</p>
<p>
We know less about how climate change may affect the Santa Anas, though
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self"><u>experts
have some theories</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
What does this mean for L.A.’s housing crisis?
</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/california-windstorm-fuels-pacific-palisades-wildfire-as-residents-flee-live-updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>At
least 12,000 structures</u></a> have burned so far in the fires, which
is already exacerbating the strain on the Los Angeles housing market —
one of the country’s tightest even before the fires — as thousands of
displaced people look for new places to live. “Dozens and dozens of
people are going after the same properties,” one real estate agent
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-11/their-houses-burned-down-now-they-are-fighting-for-the-few-homes-left-on-the-market" target="_blank"><u>told

gouging</u></a> — including raising rental prices more than 10% — during
an emergency is against the law.
</p>
<p>
Los Angeles had a shortage of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/09/business/la-fires-housing-shortage.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
370,000 homes before the fires</u></a>, and between 2021 and 2023, the

than two years</u></a> for even the first Housing and Urban Development
Disaster Recovery Grants’ expenditures to go out.
</p>
<p>
My colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/los-angeles-fires-cost" target="_self"><u>wrote
for Heatmap</u></a> that the economic impact of the Los Angeles fire is
already much higher than that of other fires, such as the 2018 Camp
fire, partly because of the value of the Pacific Palisades real estate.
</p>
<h3>
What does this mean for insurance rates in California?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The wildfires may “deal a devastating blow to [California’s] fragile
home insurance market,” Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>wrote
last week</u></a>. In recent years, home insurers have left California
or declined to write new policies, at least partially due to the
increased risk of wildfires in the state.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the extent of the damage from the fires, the coffers of
California’s FAIR Plan — which insures homeowners who can’t get
insurance otherwise, including many in Pacific Palisades and Altadena —
could empty, causing it to seek money from insurers, according to the
state’s regulations. As Zeitlin writes, “This would mean that
Californians who <em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance —
because they don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have
abandoned — could be on the hook for massive wildfire losses.”
</p>
<h3>
What’s the best way to keep up with evacuation orders?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
First and foremost,

up for all relevant emergency alerts</u></a>. Make sure to turn on the
sound on your phone and keep it near you in case of a change in
conditions. Pack a “go bag” with essentials and consider filling your

How can I help?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
There are many scams in the wake of disasters as crooks look to take
advantage of desperate people — and those who want to help them. To play
it safe, you can use a hub
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/act/wildfire-relief/california" target="_blank"><u>like
the one established by GoFundMe</u></a>, which is actively vetting
campaigns related to the L.A. fires. If you’re looking to volunteer your
time, make a donation of clothing or food, or if you’re able to foster
animals the fire has displaced, you can use
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMk34XY5dsvVJjAoD2mQUVHYU_Ib6COz6jcGH5uJWDY/htmlview?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><u>this
handy database</u></a> from the Mutual Aid Network L.A. There are also
many national organizations, such as the Red Cross, that you can connect
with if you want to help.
</p>
<p>
The City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Fire Department have asked
that do-gooders not bring donations directly to fire stations or
shelters; such actions can interfere with emergency operations. Their
website provides more information about how you can help — productively

<h2
id="us-forecasters-warn-of-explosive-fire-growth-conditions-amid-deadly-california-wildfires">US
forecasters warn of ‘explosive fire growth’ conditions amid deadly
California wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters in Southern California are battling Monday to bring
multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control as forecasters
warned of renewed strong winds that could cause “explosive fire
growth.”</p>
<p>The new wind threat, with the biggest concern extending from late
Monday through Wednesday morning, is expected to bring sustained winds
of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service
warned.</p>
<p>Forecasters called it a “particularly dangerous situation” and
designated it as a red flag warning.</p>
<p>Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received
significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires
that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of
dollars in damage since they began a week ago.</p>
<p>A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters
aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in
bringing the blazes under control.</p>
<p>Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said
Monday the Palisades Fire was 14% contained and has burned 96 square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the
Pacific Palisades area, officials said.</p>
<p>Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in
North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 33% contained by Monday morning
and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Sixteen more people have been reported missing in the areas of the
two fires, with officials warning that the number of fatalities is
likely to increase.</p>
<p>Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained,
Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers.</p>
<p>The ongoing blazes, along with other fires that have been contained,
together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. President Joe Biden said, “Our hearts ache for
the 24 innocent souls we have lost in the wildfires across Los Angeles.
Jill and I pray for them and their loved ones. We are deeply saddened by
the devastation caused by the unprecedented ongoing wildfires across
Southern California.”</p>
<p>Biden said he is being updated frequently on the fires and directed
federal agencies to dispatch any help and equipment California
authorities need.</p>
<p>“To the brave firefighters and first responders working day and night
to suppress these fires and save lives: our nation is grateful,” Biden
said. “You represent the best of America, and we are in your debt.”</p>
<p>About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday,
with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk
areas while the new wind warnings were still in place.</p>
<p>Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming
operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles
Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games
Monday after canceling games due to the fires. But a key National
Football League playoff game involving the Los Angeles Rams set for
Monday night was moved to the neighboring state of Arizona.</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned
artworks, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on
Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S.
history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the
scale and scope.”</p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country.</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’”</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds [160 kph] determinative and
there was really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense Department said more than 1,800 California National
Guard personnel have been activated to assist with the firefighting
efforts and aircraft deployed to drop water and fire retardants over the
raging fires.</p>

id="philadelphia-76ers-wont-build-disputed-1.3b-downtown-stadium">Philadelphia
76ers won’t build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not
to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes
just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial
project from the city council.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council
members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal
with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city’s sports stadium district,
the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not
been released.</p>
<p>The 76ers, the mayor’s office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the
Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond
Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast
Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also
play there.</p>
<p>The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after
more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners
of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by
2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby
Chinatown residents and other activists.</p>
<p>“I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,” Jimmy Harrity,
an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who
supported the team’s move, said, “I feel as though I was used as a
pawn.”</p>
<p>Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has
said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic
game-changing economic development project.” Supporters had hoped the
18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called
Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has
struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.</p>
<p>The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, had
pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target
opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction
funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds.
Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in
annual payments in lieu of taxes.</p>
<p>Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well
as gentrification and rising rents to the area.</p>
<p>The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments
since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a
highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in
1991.</p>

burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County’s
Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both
her and her daughter during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires
around Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid’s adventure group
called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for
preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would
spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like
Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near
Altadena, now destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to
glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path
that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn’t stop talking about it for
days.</p>
<p>For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not
just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are
mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and
learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the
pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every
type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based
preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more.</p>
<p>“It’s about so much more than what she’s been learning,” Contreras
said. “I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me,
personally.”</p>
<p>The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey
Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana’s children attend.</p>
<p>“The community has been devastated by the fire,” said Ordenana,
senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. “It’s
been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help
them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their
homes. And we don’t know the impact to school staff, like their
teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost
their homes.”</p>
<p>Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air
quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been
affected by the end of the week but it’s not clear when the air quality
there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who
was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that
gained fame under the name P-22.</p>
<p>Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families
from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is
uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures
already extending through next week.</p>
<p>All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s
second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over
the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials
said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several
of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle
School.</p>
<p>The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday
saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura,
and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be
closed Monday.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen.
She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but
her daughter’s outdoor education helped her better understand the value
of stepping away from the grind.</p>
<p>Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although
it’s unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like
Eaton Canyon.</p>
<p>“The nature center is gone,” Richard Smart, superintendent of the
Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. “The wildflowers,
the shrubs are gone.” The park hosted dozens of school field trips a
year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited
yearly.</p>
<p>“Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was
nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a
friendly, safe environment,” he said.</p>
<p>Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left
standing, he said.</p>
<p>“For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their
backyard, and now they won’t be able to use it for the foreseeable
future,” he said. “The park is such a touchstone for people in the
community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the
right word. It feels indescribable.”</p>
<p>Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where
to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles,
said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural
History Museum and author of “Wild L.A,” a field trip and nature
guidebook.</p>
<p>A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers
heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention
deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>“For children’s cognitive development, time in nature and time spent
connecting with nature is so important,” Higgins said. Outdoor spaces
also can help children learn how to develop relationships through
connections with animals, understand orientation through space by
following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on
wildlife.</p>
<p>“A lot of the places that we’re talking about are really popular with
homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips,
certainly places like Eaton Canyon,” said Greg Pauly, co-author of “Wild
L.A.” and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. “I
do think it’s safe to say that people are going to continue to be
interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field
trip destination in the future. But it’s certainly going to be a while
before that happens.”</p>
<p>“This is the reality of modern Southern California,” he said. “Fire
changes the landscape and people’s lives shockingly often.”</p>

wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie
landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring
through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie
stars. </p>
<p>But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows
that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of
Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They
have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many
people own their own homes. </p>
<p>Some now fear the most destructive fires in California’s history have
altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for
many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. </p>
<p>Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly
Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the
wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends
UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class
neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. </p>
<p>“We don’t have like, ‘Oh, I’ll just go to my second home and stay
there,’” Santoro said. </p>
<p>The landlord of their family’s two-bedroom house with a pool had
never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to
affordably raise their daughters. Now, they’re temporarily staying with
a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much
else. </p>
<p>“I think it’s hard to believe that you have nothing,” Santoro said,
through tears, thinking of her parents. “Everything that they ever
worked for was in that house.” </p>
<p>Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions.
The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists,
entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of
residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a
fifth Black, according to Census data. </p>
<p>During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of
opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the
discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept
homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black
home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national
rate. </p>
<p>That’s impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in
Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American
Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of
residents live in poverty. </p>
<p>Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the
fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. </p>
<p>“Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And
that is going to change the character of Altadena,” Knapp said, adding
that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. </p>
<p>The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able
to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden
bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. </p>
<p>He is challenging state and federal officials to help all
fire-affected communities fairly because “your $40 million home is no
different than my $2 million home.” </p>
<p>Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest.
“Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,” he said. “If you
can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion
dollars to help us get back where we were at.” </p>
<p>Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school
she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners
who might be tempted with offers for their property: “I would tell them
to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African
Americans.” </p>
<p>She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise
money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. </p>
<p>But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the
bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. </p>
<p>The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than
10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance
and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to
gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the
congregation, paying the price. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to
move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too
expensive for them,” he said. </p>
<p>The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two
jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the
wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost
everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography
gear. </p>
<p>She did not have renter’s insurance. “Obviously now I’m thinking
about it. Wish I had it,” she said. </p>
<p>Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and
regroup. But she likely won’t be returning to Altadena.</p>

id="den-of-thieves-2-is-no.-1-at-box-office-as-better-man-flops">‘Den of
Thieves 2’ is No. 1 at box office as ‘Better Man’ flops</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of
Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los
Angeles, Lionsgate’s “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera” debuted atop the box
office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly
exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the
country’s top box-office market.</p>
<p>A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, “Den of Thieves 2”
performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by
STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson
Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American
theaters.</p>
<p>Butler’s films are becoming something of a regular feature in
January. He also starred in “Plane,” which managed $32.1 million after
launching on Jan. 13 in 2023.</p>
<p>“Den of Thieves 2,” made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly
to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a “B+” CinemaScore.
Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it
counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since “The Hunger Games: The
Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in November 2023.</p>
<p>Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams
movie “Better Man,” one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic
in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton
John (“Rocketman”) or Elvis Presley (“Elvis”), the British popstar is
portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film.</p>
<p>The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and
acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than
Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1
million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature,
2017’s “The Greatest Showman” ($459 million worldwide), fared far better
in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for “Better Man.”</p>
<p>It was bested by “The Last Showgirl,” the Las Vegas drama starring
Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870
theaters and collected $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Also outdoing “Better Man” was Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” Coming
off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic
grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand
wider in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The weekend’s lion share of business went to holiday holdovers,
including “Mufasa: The Lion King,” “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” “Nosferatu”
and “Moana 2.”</p>
<p>In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins “Mufasa” continued to do
well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million
worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” padded its
$384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’
“Nosferatu,” the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8
million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million
domestically.</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” in its seventh week of release,
added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the
coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to
notch $1 billion, joining “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool and
Wolverine.”</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $15.5 million.</p></li>

Jan. 6 participants who committed violence ‘obviously’ shouldn’t be
pardoned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible
for the violence during the Capitol riot “obviously” should not be
pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his
clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to
overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. </p>
<p>Vance insisted in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that the pardon
question is “very simple,” saying those who “protested peacefully”
should be pardoned and “if you committed violence on that day, obviously
you shouldn’t be pardoned.” He later said there was a “bit of a gray
area” in some cases. </p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming
from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent
lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe
Biden’s 2020 victory. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were
charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the
Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for
beating police officers.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were
convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as
plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump,
the Republican incumbent, to Biden. </p>
<p>In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the
Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all
convicted. “I’ve been defending these guys for years,” he said. </p>
<p>“The president saying he’ll look at each case (and me saying the
same) is not some walkback,” Vance said. “I assure you, we care about
people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it
includes people who got a garbage trial.”</p>

<h2 id="los-angeles-fires-death-toll-rises-to-at-least-24">Los Angeles
fires death toll rises to at least 24</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles
area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more
bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods
that have been leveled by the blazes. </p>
<p>Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California
as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could
pose new threats in the coming days.</p>
<p>“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne
Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way
they’re going.”</p>
<p>Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could
endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key
landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art
works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top
public U.S. universities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the
devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There
are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”</p>
<p>“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the
wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms
of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and
scope.” </p>
<p>A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic
losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so
high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground
is among the costliest in the country. </p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on,
with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the
blazes as they quickly spread out of control.</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply
overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was
really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?”</p>
<p>“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don’t want to wait
because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I
want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may.
This is not about finger pointing.”</p>
<p>The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on
the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What
happened to the water system?’</p>
<p>Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a
440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run
dry.</p>
<p>Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most
destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and
grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes
are forecast to return. </p>
<p>“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz
told reporters at a Saturday briefing. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday
night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112
kph.</p>
<p>Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than
16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures.
About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700
people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes
remain under investigation.</p>
<p>Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the
other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11%
contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405,
into a more heavily populated area.</p>
<p>Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that
firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent
control” of the flames.</p>
<p>Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of
the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and
more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from
Mexico.</p>

id="court-ruling-will-help-new-mexico-stay-a-go-to-state-for-women-seeking-abortions">Court
ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking
abortions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday
struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties,
helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from
other states with bans.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney
General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state’s position as having some of
the most liberal abortion laws in the country.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and
Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal “anti-vice”
law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local
abortion ordinances.</p>
<p>But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said
state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or
regulating abortion clinics.</p>
<p>“The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the
Legislature’s authority to regulate access to and provision of
reproductive healthcare,” she wrote. “We hold the ordinances are
preempted in their entirety.”</p>
<p>New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court’s ruling
Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws
preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that
would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure
in New Mexico,” he said. “It’s enshrined in law by the recent ruling by
the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico
Legislature.”</p>
<p>New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care
a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take a genius to understand the statutory framework that
we have. Local governments don’t regulate health care in New Mexico. It
is up to the state,” the Albuquerque Democrat said.</p>
<p>Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the
border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New
Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to
shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to
abortion.</p>
<p>In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute
that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to
abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.</p>
<p>And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed
a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access
and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from
investigations by other states.</p>
<p>In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive
health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to
local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.</p>
<p>The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide
services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception,
cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s opinion, justices said they “strongly admonish”
Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have
allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than
$100,000 for violations of the county’s abortion ordinance.</p>
<p>The provision would have created “a private right of action and
damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct,” the
court said in its opinion.</p>
<p>Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an
Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued
on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized
the court’s decision and emphasized its limitations.</p>
<p>“Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to
enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of
their citizens,” said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of
Missouri. “We’re grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not
abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state
constitution.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in
federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act
restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion
explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its
decision solely on state provisions.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas
solicitor general and architect of that state’s strict abortion ban,
said he looked forward “to litigating these issues in other states and
bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of
the United States.”</p>

hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break
after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18
Celsius January morning.</p>
<p>She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a
Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities
among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great
outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.</p>
<p>“They understand my lifestyle. I don’t have to explain myself,” said
Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose
family hails from Yemen. “My religion is everything. It’s my survival
kit.”</p>
<p>As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often
attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the
headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol
of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics,
devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in
finding accommodations for religious practices.</p>
<p>Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head
covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression,
Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group
three years ago.</p>
<p>From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown
to more than 700 members. There’s a core group for Muslim women only —
for “more sisterhood and modesty,” Habib says — as well as a group for
families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and
education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge
for many migrant communities — to health and environmental
sustainability from the perspective of Islam.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and
rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation,”
Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty
chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. “How can we be more
sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change,
especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?”</p>
<p>Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States
from Somalia as children about two decades ago.</p>
<p>They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s,
growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly
vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first
lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis
was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call
to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.</p>
<p>Even though she feels “safe and accepted” in her hijab, Hirsi joined
the group for extra support.</p>
<p>“I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more
comfortable to participate,” she said on the tubing hill, where she had
convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever done,” Mahamud
gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister’s as
their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.</p>
<p>The sisters said it’s important to include love for the outdoors and
physical activity in their children’s religious upbringing.</p>
<p>“Taking care of one’s health is part of our faith,” Hirsi said.</p>
<p>Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports
participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who
studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders
mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families
who might frown on it.</p>
<p>Groups like Habib’s tackle empowering women in their communities as
well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex
spaces or locations for prayer.</p>
<p>“The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to
spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty
and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be
in mixed spaces without covering up,” Habib said.</p>
<p>She appears to have tapped into a great demand.</p>
<p>“When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get
sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I’ve been looking
for for a very long time,” Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing
hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat.
“I didn’t really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already
around me.”</p>
<p>Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as
much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described “homebody” she had
largely avoided since college days.</p>
<p>“It’s a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone,” she said of
the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences
but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.</p>
<p>“We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as
well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we’re walking,”
Mohamed added.</p>
<p>Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill,
Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up
their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the
group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.</p>
<p>“With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through,
even with the clothing and hijabs,” Latifi said. “It feels way, way more
like, you know, where you are with family.”</p>

honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest
civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was “a light
of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.”</p>
<p>Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person
on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his
presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the
wildfires in California.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a
phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and
alleviate suffering around the world.</p>
<p>It’s the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction
during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with
distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President
Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only
time in Obama’s two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.</p>
<p>The citation for the pope says “his mission of serving the poor has
never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions
about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and
protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different
faiths.”</p>
<p>Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors
to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent
weeks.</p>

<h2 id="blue-origin-set-for-1st-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket">Blue Origin
set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff
Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a
brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space
race.</p>
<p>The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due
to “unfavorable” sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.</p>
<p>Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first
American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters)
tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast
off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that
opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.</p>
<p>“Pointy end up!” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside
photos of the gleaming white behemoth.</p>
<p>With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world’s second-richest man,
is taking direct aim at the world’s wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company
SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and
Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA —
including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International
Space Station.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game
in town and so having a competitor… this is great,” G. Scott Hubbard, a
retired senior NASA official, told AFP.</p>
<p>SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship —
its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of
high-stakes rivalry.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt
to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor
of Bezos’ mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange
in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will
be Blue Origin’s first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rocket’s upper stage will fire its engines toward
Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship
called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test
flight.</p>
<p>Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while
successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome “bonus.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets —
used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on
terra firma rather than a ship at sea.</p>
<p>Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes
aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project
Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with
Starlink.</p>
<p>Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk
dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry
off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, “humanity’s
blue origin.”</p>
<p>He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX
— but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival’s “fail
fast, learn fast” philosophy.</p>
<p>“There’s been impatience within the space community over Blue
Origin’s very deliberate approach,” Scott Pace, a space policy analyst
at George Washington University and former member of the National Space
Council, told AFP.</p>
<p>If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government
“dissimilar redundancy” — valuable backup if one system fails.</p>

id="trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-from-us-justice-department">Trump
prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against
Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat
and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican
president-elect prepares to return to the White House. </p>
<p>Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a
court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking
her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final
report.  </p>
<p>Notice of Smith’s resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which
said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final
confidential report on January 7, and “separated” from the Justice
Department on January 10.  </p>
<p>A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four
criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a
halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S.
Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that
former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official
acts. Neither case went to trial. </p>
<p>After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the
November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding
Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In
asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith’s team defended the merits
of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump’s impending
return to the White House made them untenable.  </p>
<p>Smith’s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal
cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for
the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his
political comeback. </p>
<p>Smith’s resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump,
who has frequently called Smith “deranged” had said he would fire him
immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he
may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him
once he returns to office. </p>
<p>Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to
face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with
trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016
presidential campaign. Smith’s charges followed, accusing Trump of
illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of
trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6,
2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged
Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that
state. </p>
<p>Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically
motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in
campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to
drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed
against him and his supporters. </p>
<p>The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by
career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.</p>
