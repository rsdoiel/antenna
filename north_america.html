(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>The federal shutdown is already having intense effects on unpaid federal workers. But we could be approaching a tipping point. In a memo, the USDA says about 42 million people will not get their SNAP benefits, starting Saturday. We'll hear more. Also, even if we don't get an inflation report, consumers are still pinched by rising prices. And, will Canada's transportation systems be ready for the FIFA World Cup next year?</p>

      <p>Price increases are price increases, and consumers will bemoan inflation no matter the cause, right? Maybe not so much. Research shows that consumers tend to view inflation brought on by tariffs in a different light.

But first, Louisiana will be building the first “rare earths separation facility” in the U.S.</p>

      <h1>US and China agree ‘framework’ for trade deal ahead of Xi-Trump meeting | First Thing</h1>

      <p>
      <p>US treasury secretary anticipates tariff truce with China will be extended, and that Beijing will revive substantial purchases of US soybeans. Plus, is Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales the last decent tech baron?</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p>
<p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p>
<p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p>

      <h1>Southeast Asian countries strike trade deals with U.S.</h1>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit is underway in Malaysia. So far, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia have all struck a series of trade agreements with President Donald Trump. Then, the party of Argentinian President Javier Milei saw major wins in Sunday's midterm elections, despite widespread discontent with deep austerity measures. And we'll learn about preparations for next summer’s FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted jointly by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in 16 different cities.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)

      <p>The four-time MVP faced his old team on Sunday night and put in a respectable performance. But it was Jordan Love who was able to control the game</p>
<p>It all started so well. And then it fell apart.</p>
<p>For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers">and a lone Super Bowl</a>. But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.</p>

<p>The Canadian Environmental Law Association is recommending that all cities pass bylaws to make it mandatory for property owners to replace lead pipes on their side of the property line. Hamilton has a bylaw aimed at preventing partial lead service-line replacements, and some Quebec and Saskatchewan have similar rules. Here's what people in Thunder Bay, Ont., have to say about the idea as the city faces a $350-million class-action lawsuit.</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>The arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gambling</p>
<p>The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.</p>
<p>Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims">were arrested Thursday</a> in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james">who allegedly provided</a> “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.</p>

It prompted hundreds of protesters to mobilize outside the Coast Guard base</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

      <h1>'Stupid political stunt': Vance criticises Knesset vote to annex West Bank – video</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>US vice-president has criticised Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling the move a 'stupid political stunt' after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv’s international airport before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, JD Vance insisted that 'the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren't happy about it,' adding:'I personally take some insult to it'</p>

      <h1>Beef prices and the beef of tomorrow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

How does that work? What’s in it for the U.S.? Later in this episode: AI firms juice the stock market, an economist explains Trump’s flavor of state capitalism, and sports betting sites push the boundary between state and federal regulation.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Tesla unveiled cheaper versions of some of its most popular cars. Other automakers are also promising to discount EVs or roll out more affordable models. This all comes following the end of federal tax credits that knocked as much as $7,500 off the price of a new EV. Also: a proposal that could grant crypto firms access to Fed infrastructure and a check-in with Cuba's tourism minister.</p>

      <p>Netflix is trying a new strategy to make more money: It's worked out a deal to stream some podcasts from Spotify, which have both audio and video. The deal means access to more consumer data and a new audience. And it's a move against a common competitor: YouTube. Also on the show: a change in tune on crytpo from a Federal Reserve leader and OpenAI's very own web browser.</p>

<p>But, as with all applications of AI tools, data security concerns loom. And some nations are adopting the new technology quicker than others. For an overview, Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Savannah Peters, who covers Indigenous communities for Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration has moved to axe many Biden-era green initiatives. One project impacted is in Middletown, Ohio — the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled.

      <p>Silver hit an all-time high last week. Helping fuel that rally is a physical shortage; global demand for silver has been outstripping supply since 2020. We'll hear about the supply of silver, which has more industrial uses than its flashier cousin, gold. Also, a Brazilian oil giant will start drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River.

But the conservative leader, who models herself after former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will have to tackle a range of economic challenges: a falling population, a rise in the cost of living, and sluggish growth.

      <p>Agriculture is notoriously susceptible to the whims of the elements.

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>California has enacted a law requiring rideshare giants Uber and Lyft to collectively bargain with their drivers. Because the drivers are technically independent contractors, they otherwise would not have federally-protected labor rights like full-time employees. The new state law could be a game changer.</p>

(date: 2025-10-17)

      <p>Two midsize U.S. lenders claimed they were victims of loan fraud this week, sending bank stocks into a tailspin. But by close Friday, markets evened out — and for good reason: Regional banks, overall, are actually doing well. In this episode, we dispel the midsize bank sector doomsayers. Plus: Rising auto loan delinquencies could be a consumer debt canary in the coal mine, American culinary sensibilities have moved beyond “foodie” culture, and goats are the star employees in one family's landscaping business.</p>

      <p>Rates on 30-year mortgages fell again this week to an average of 6.27%, according to FreddieMac. That could boost consumer spending on home improvements in 2026, new research finds — and be driven by homeowners locked in with lower rates who recognize that an addition or coat of paint is less daunting than starting over in this housing market.

      <h1>Time for another supply chain slowdown</h1>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. retail and supply chain sectors are slowing down — September’s Logistics Managers’ Index hits its lowest point since March. Many retailers are stopping shipments after stocking up early to avoid tariffs. Ongoing trade uncertainty and rising costs have companies fretting about the long term. Also in this episode: Gen Z plans to spend less this holiday season, tariffs muddle international library lending, and Colorado colleges partner with the private sector to expand skilled jobs training.</p>

      <p>
      <p>It’s a big week for bank earnings. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported quarterly results on Tuesday; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag. We'll unpack. Also on the show: a major cryptocurrency scam and the economics of Broadway contract negotiations.</p>

      <p>Joel Mokyr is a professor at Northwestern University, who — along with Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt — won the Nobel prize in economics earlier this week. Today, Mokyr joins the program to discuss how major technological changes can boost economic growth — that is, if politics and institutions can adapt quickly enough. Plus, why the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings are raising questions about private credit markets and big banks’ exposure to them.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Greece's government is voting on a bill authorizing private sector employees to work up to 13 hours a day, if both employee and employer agree. Labor unions have called mass strikes in protest, paralyzing the public sector. This comes as Greece faces high debt, rising inflation, and lower wages than much of the European Union.

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab. Marketplace’s Savannah Peters joins Kimberly to explain how tribal communities get caught up in the federal government’s dysfunctional budget process and why tribal leaders argue this needs to change.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education.

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles.

      <p>Wanna put a wager on, well, just about anything? Try a prediction market. Competing industry giants Kalshi and Polymarket both saw major investment this week, and for good reason. Though they don’t look it on paper, both function as (extremely lucrative) sports betting platforms but don't face the regulations of sports betting platforms. In this episode, we bet on where that legal loophole is headed. Plus: Expect car sales to sputter as the EV tax credit ends and tariffs drive up costs, and the case for replacing subsidized air travel with a more robust rural bus system.</p>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>Federal programs and funding play an important role in Indian Country, because of the government’s trust responsibility to provide or fund services to tribal nations in exchange for ceded land that now comprises the United States. That relationship also means that shutdowns hit tribal nations particularly hard. We'll learn what that means for services like health care and food distribution programs. Then, a lifelong Las Vegas resident reflects on the city's economic slowdown.</p>

      <p>The value of the U.S. dollar has been on the rise after months of decline. Political turmoil abroad has hurt other currencies, while easing rates and resilience at home have helped stabilize the dollar. However, investors are still cautious. Also in this episode: the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ “birth-death” model suggests the economy may be weakening, silver prices surpass a 45-year record, and Delta posts solid Q3 results by catering to the upper class.</p>

      <h1>An economic vocab lesson for the Trump era</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today we’re all getting smarter about some of the economic and political terms dominating the headlines these days.

      <h1>Could airport slowdowns end the shutdown?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

He also hinted that there could be an imminent deal between India and the U.S. on tariffs; India is currently suffering under 50% duties. Also, China has tightened export controls on rare earth metals, which are vital to a range of electronic devices, including military hardware.</p>

      <p>A recent study of nearly 20,000 University of California, San Diego Health workers found cybersecurity training reduced the likelihood of successful phising attacks by just 2%.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Ariana Mirian, senior researcher at the cybersecurity firm Censys and co-author of the study, who explained that many workers are just not taking those training programs seriously enough.</p>

      <h1>Our economic future is a black box</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>Know how the government shutdown put the kibosh on federal data distribution, like last week’s cancelled September jobs report? Well experts haven’t just had a tough week of interpreting this economy — they’ve had a tough year. In this episode, the Trump administration’s policies have uniquely muddied traditional economic forecasting. Plus: Adjustable-rate mortgages grow in popularity, the food and beverage industry adapts to GLP-1 proliferation, and an American furniture manufacturer discusses Trump’s tariffs.</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>Just two months ago, the World Trade Organization predicted global trade would grow by nearly 2% next year. Now, it’s revised that forecast down to just 0.5% as the impact of the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs sinks in. We'll hear what's been propping up trade so far and what's on the road ahead. Then, &quot;Marketplace Tech&quot; shares tips for spotting job scams. And later, we'll hear how other countries' &quot;gold card&quot; visa programs fared.</p>

      <h1>Using tariffs to help farmers ... harmed by tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

What's driving the surge? Then, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is attending a two-day summit in India focused on trade, but he's insisting the U.K. won't issue more visas to Indian workers.

      <h1>AI "workslop" is hurting coworker dynamics</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Later this week, we’ll learn more about how the Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates when the Federal Open Market Committee releases the minutes of its most recent meeting. The document will give us clues about what's ahead and where FOMC members' priorities lie. Also on this morning's show: the IRS will now have a CEO, renewable energy becomes the world's largest electricity source, and OPEC producers decide to expand output.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Energy thinktank Ember says that for the first time, solar and wind met all new global electricity demand in the first half of this year. Could this be a turning point for the global energy system? Then, London police dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen cell phones. And, Zimbabwe is on a quest to become Africa’s blueberry capital after it signed a tariff-free export protocol with China.</p>

      <h1>Online job scams are a growing problem</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Mark Anthony Dyson, author of the Job Scam Report newsletter, about how to spot scams.</p>

      <p>OpenAI announced it will invest big time in chipmaker AMD, potentially in exchange for a stake in the firm. As AI investment has ramped up, similar deals have become common. Do these partnerships signal a strengthening sector? Or are they a symptom of an AI bubble headed toward a burst? Also in this episode: Regional banks merge under Trump appointees’ relaxed regulatory rule, retailers are optimistic about the upcoming holiday shopping season, and Houston’s housing market experiences knock-on effects of deportation duress.</p>

      <h1>A shutdown, layoffs, and yet the market keeps surging</h1>

(date: 2025-10-06)
      <p>
      <p>Over the weekend, the White House threatened more layoffs if negotiations between Democrats and Republicans continue to go nowhere. Meanwhile, 100,000 earlier federal layoffs and buyouts finally took effect last week. But stocks hit a record on Friday. What gives? We'll discuss with Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. Plus, a lack of trust in artificial intelligence is hampering its adoption among small and mid-sized businesses.</p>

      <p>The nonprofit One Earth has been tracking $400 billion worth of private investment in climate change solutions. Thing is, the amount of money being invested in climate causes is both not enough and unevenly distributed. This morning, we'll find out what’s driving the gap and what can be done about it. But first, Costco members will soon be able to buy discounted weight-loss drugs, and beer makers are struggling with tariffs and changing consumer demand.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Nikkei 225 stock index in Japan rose sharply on the first day of trading after Sanae Takaichi won the contest to lead the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Then, Jaguar Land Rover plans to resume vehicle production in the U.K. today, six weeks after a cyberattack forced a production pause. And, although the artificial intelligence industry is worth close to $250 billion, some businesses are rejecting its use altogether. We'll hear from them.</p>
