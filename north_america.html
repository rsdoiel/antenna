      <h1>Trump administration says it will partially fund Snap food aid benefits– live</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Trump administration says in court filing it plans to use emergency funds to partially cover November Snap benefits for millions of Americans</p>
<p>Looking ahead, on Wednesday, <strong>the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.</strong> It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.</p>
<p>My colleague, <strong>Eduardo Porter</strong>, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.</p>
<p>Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf">levy a tariff</a> – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.</p>
<p>IEEPA <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701">gives the president</a> authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.</p>

<p>Children splash gleefully in the river as adults cast fishing lines or head into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska">Alaska</a> tundra to hunt. It’s a scene that has characterized summer days for centuries among the Yup’ik people who have long lived in south-western Alaska, where the village of Nunapitchuk stands. But, with temperatures in Alaska warming nearly four times faster than most parts of the globe, that way of life is about to change.</p>
<p>Homes in Nunapitchuk have been sinking into the <a href="https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/frozen-ground-permafrost">permafrost</a>, and residents have decided their only choice is to move the entire village to higher ground.</p>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>That's the question before the Supreme Court this week. President Donald Trump has been declaring an emergency and then using emergency authority to impose many of these tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is among those who've said they expect to prevail in the high court, but if they don't, there are other ways to apply taxes on goods from other countries. Also: BP shale asset sales and a dark side of the drug rehab industry.</p>

      <p>This past weekend, as the shutdown stretches on, funds for SNAP benefits began to dry up. The Treasury Secretary says payments could restart this week, and a federal court said the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds to get this done. Today, we'll check in with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance for a snapshot of food insecurity there. Plus, Trump says he wants to fix Obamacare, and U.S. auto production could be hampered by a looming chip shortage.</p>

<p>Dr George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave on Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) office of general counsel were notified of the issues, the HHS press secretary, Emily Hilliard, said in an email.

      <p>Oxfam says Trump policies risk driving inequality to new heights while noting Democrats have also exacerbated wealth gap. Plus, why Salman Rushdie’s therapist has called him a ‘badass’</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The collective wealth of the top 10 US billionaires has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/wealth-billionaires-increase-trump">soared by $698bn in the past year</a>, according to a report from Oxfam America on the growing wealth divide.</p>
<p><strong>How have Trump’s policies affected the figures?</strong> Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in May, has been one of the “single largest transfers of wealth upwards in decades”, according to the report, by cutting tax for the wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The system, which launched more than a year ago, rewards soldiers who achieve strikes with points that can be exchanged to buy more weapons in an “Amazon-for-war” online store called Brave1 filled with more than 100 different drones, autonomous vehicles and other drone war material.</p>

      <p>The president’s wife is reported to have ‘privately raised concerns about’ the destruction of the White House East Wing. If so, they were ignored</p>
<p>From Eleanor Roosevelt to Melania Trump, the East Wing of the White House served as a base for first ladies.

<p>“It was a place where first ladies could carry out the important work that they do,” said Katherine AS Sibley, a professor of history at St Joseph’s University.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is serving 25 years in federal prison for fraud. His company collapsed and went bankrupt in 2022. Investigators found that billions of dollars in customer funds had been borrowed without permission to help shore up Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.</p>
<p>But throughout the last three years, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence, and he's filed an appeal. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Jonathan Jones, a reporter and producer for the investigative podcast “Reveal,” who spent hours talking to the former CEO, FTX insiders and customers.</p>

      <h1>At the World Series the Blue Jays belonged to Canada – and large parts of the US too</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>One baseball win was never going to bind Canada – and sympathetic fans south of the border – together for ever. But it was sweet while it lasted</p>
<p>The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.</p>
<p>This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball">a heartbreaking Game 7</a>, missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.</p>

      <h1>The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad game</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Buffalo extended their regular season domination over Kansas City. But they know that the playoffs are another matter altogether</p>
<p>Of course Josh Allen didn’t take a breath in the final seconds of the latest Chiefs-Bills classic. “You never know with Pat [Mahomes],” Allen told reporters after Buffalo eked out a 28-21 win on Sunday. Bills kicker Matt Prater had earlier missed a 52-yard field goal with 27 seconds remaining that would have sealed the win for Buffalo. Even the miss was dramatic, with Prater doinking his kick off the right upright. Allen wasn’t alone in thinking Mahomes could lead the Chiefs 58 yards down the field with 22 seconds left and no time outs. One Chiefs fan in Buffalo certainly <a href="https://x.com/TrainwreckSprts/status/1985030484615721042">reminded the home crowd</a> of Buffalo’s 2021 divisional round collapse in which Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill and then Travis Kelce with 13 seconds remaining to set up a game-tying field goal and eventual overtime win.</p>
<p>Are these two teams capable of a producing a boring contest when they meet? Sunday had looked like it would go down that route, given the statement made by Buffalo’s defense, before the Chiefs threatened a comeback in the fourth quarter. The Bills had responded to questions about their depleted defense by stymying Mahomes for most of the game. This <a href="https://x.com/NFL/status/1985126243839488080">sandwich sack</a> by Greg Rousseau and Michael Hoecht showed the tenacity of Buffalo’s defensive line. They needed it: Mahomes converted on fourth and 17 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, a reminder that no matter the situation, he is always capable of tormenting the Bills.</p>

      <h1>Talking Horses | Willie Mullins eyes Melbourne and Breeders’ Cup double after shock triumph</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>The dominant jumps racing trainer has another huge Flat prize in sight after Ethical Diamond’s sparkling success</p>
<p>If five wins from the seven turf events, one short of the record, felt like a standard return for European runners at the 2025 Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar, then the identity of the biggest winner of all was a huge, and very refreshing, surprise.</p>
<p>Willie Mullins blew into Del Mar with Ethical Diamond, his first ever runner at the meeting, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/01/breeders-cup-2025-day-two-live">left with the $2m first prize in the Turf</a>, nearly five times as much as he banked when Nick Rockett landed the Grand National in April. And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/ethical-diamond-shines-bright-to-hand-william-buick-a-first-success-in-the-ebor">Ebor Handicap winner</a> leave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.</p>

Instead, Harris was nominated by a virtual vote of party delegates.</p>

      <h1>John F Kennedy grandson says Julia Fox’s bloody Jackie Halloween costume ‘disgusting’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>Jack Schlossberg says ‘dangerous’ to evoke grandfather’s assassination; Fox says it’s a ‘statement’ of Jackie’s ‘bravery’</p>
<p>Political writer and commentator Jack Schlossberg has said it was “disgusting, desperate and dangerous” for actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/julia-fox">Julia Fox</a> to wear a Halloween costume evoking the assassination of president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy">John F Kennedy</a>, his grandfather.</p>
<p>Fox, however, has defended her controversial decision to wear a replica of the blood-stained, pink suit that former first lady Jackie Kennedy was seen wearing when her husband was shot dead by a sniper while the couple rode in a motorcade in Dallas in 1963. The Uncut Gems star has said she dressed as Jackie Kennedy as “a statement” about the poise and “extraordinary bravery” she showed when subjected to unimaginable “brutality”.</p>

But when Texas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/texas-democrats-california-electoral-maps-redistricting">moved ahead</a> with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat.</p>
<p>Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state’s governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>, who have cast it as a chance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/california-prop-50-trump-redistricting">to check Trump’s power</a>.</p>

      <h1>If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>The repeat champions’ vast wealth means they can stockpile talent unimaginable to other teams. But it’s undeniable that the results are hugely entertaining</p>
<p>A unicorn led off the game with a single and then trotted out to the mound to pitch the bottom of the first. Another pitcher won Games 2, 6, and 7 of the World Series, throwing 17.2 innings along the way. A catcher set a record, squatting behind the plate for 74 Fall Classic frames and ultimately ended the series by hitting the final go-ahead home run.</p>
<p>Just as everyone feared or sneered, the Los Angeles Dodgers are champions. Again. In what some forecasted as a harbinger of doom, the sinister strategy of employing the best baseball player on the planet along with a generous number of his nearly equal peers proved effective. <em>It’s not fair,</em> some people will say in the coming months about the fact that the team broadly believed to be the best ultimately won it all.</p>

Will Smith then hit the winning home run in the 11th inning off Shane Bieber, the first time the Dodgers had led all night.</p>

<p>Donald Trump thrives on emergencies. He cried havoc on the very first day of his second term, declaring a national emergency caused by an “invasion” of “ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/">illegal aliens</a>” from Mexico.

<p>Next Wednesday, he faces another of his own making, as the US supreme court hears oral arguments on whether his globe-shaking signature economic policy – tariffs – is legally valid.</p>

<p>Republicans and Democrats have entered a war in legislatures and courts to narrow the political battlefield of 2026 before a single vote is cast.</p>
<p>Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.</p>

      <p>Schmoozing the super-rich to fund a $300m ballroom while cutting food aid for those on low incomes threw the president’s architectural folly into sharp relief</p>
<p>It was a feast fit for a king – and any billionaire willing to be his subject. From gold-rimmed plates on gold-patterned tablecloths decorated with gold candlestick holders, they gorged on heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice-cream.</p>
<p>On 15 October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom-9c5f582e5c0fbde2bee67f86b22898c5">for a dinner at the White House</a> to reward them for their pledged contributions to a vast new ballroom now expected to cost $300m. That the federal government had shut down two weeks earlier scarcely seemed to matter.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning</strong></p>
<p>A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.</p>
<p>George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.</p>
<p>Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.</p>
<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.</p>
<p>Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.</p>
<p>Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.</p>
<p>Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.</p>
<p>Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won their second consecutive title in stunning fashion in the early hours of Sunday morning, depriving the Toronto Blue Jays of a first World Series in 32 years in a stomach-churning, epic Game 7. Will Smith’s solo home run with two outs at the top of the 11th inning off Shane Bieber gave LA a 5-4 lead before Yoshinobu Yamamoto, pitching in relief just a day after throwing 96 pitches, got Alejandro Kirk to ground out into a World Series-ending double play, bringing a ninth title to the Dodgers organization.</p>
<p>“Man, they’re a special group of guys,” Smith said after the game. “We just never gave up, kept fighting, pitching our asses off, hitting, taking great at-bats. Finally punched through there. Man, that was a fight for seven games. That’s a really good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> team. I’m just excited. There’s nothing better than this.”</p>

If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”</p>

<p>After last year’s election, when Republicans made significant inroads in the state, New Jersey voters will cast ballots in an off-year, unpredictable gubernatorial race that voters and experts say feels different from any in recent memory.</p>
<p>Democrat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/mikie-sherrill-new-jersey-governor-democratic-primary">Mikie Sherrill</a>, a former navy pilot and federal prosecutor who represents New Jersey’s 11th congressional District, is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, who is making his third bid for governor, this time with Donald Trump’s endorsement.</p>

      <p>Trump, the warmonger who once laughably vowed to stop 'endless wars,' will not stop waging war on this South American nation. He’s got the target list to prove it.</p>

<p>When Clint Curtis was appointed to oversee voting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a>’s Shasta county earlier this year, the Florida-based lawyer and election skeptic pledged to “fix” the voting process.</p>
<p>Curtis had never before administered an election and didn’t live in this rural northern California region. But he was well-known to followers of the US election denialism movement, who believe the voting system is not secure and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> won the 2020 presidential election. Curtis, a former congressional candidate, described himself as an expert in elections law and had long argued that voting machines could be hacked and that the government could manipulate the results of elections.</p>

<p>A spectre is haunting the NBA – the spectre of Victor Wembanyama.</p>
<p>All the powers of the old guard have entered into a tenuous alliance to contain this unicorn: rivals Luka Dončić and Anthony Edwards, the Oklahoma City radicals, and the one with the most to lose, Nikola Jokić.

<p>The New York City Marathon, like the city it takes over each fall, is as vast as it is vibrant; as loud as it is chaotic; and more than a little daunting, too.</p>
<p>No marathon is easy. But an air of unpredictability lingers over the five boroughs, with hopefuls humbled, and favorites frustrated, as they embark on a challenging 26.2-mile tour of the city.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stayed alive on Friday night, getting to Toronto Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman for three runs in the third inning to win 3-1 and even the World Series at three games apiece. Baseball fans around the world will be treated to a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday, with the Dodgers looking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since 2000. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, will try to play spoiler and complete the upset to win their first World Series since 1993.</p>
<p>After the Dodgers offense struggled in the first four games of the series, slashing just <a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/news/dodgers-offense-questions-world-series-game-6">.201/.296/.354</a> as a team, manager Dave Roberts shuffled his lineup ahead of Game 5. But it failed, as the Dodgers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/blue-jays-yesavage-dodgers-game-5-report-world-series">managed just four hits</a> and one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.</p>

      <h1>How the economy went "K-shaped"</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. economy is increasingly “K-shaped.” That means the gap between the wealthiest companies and consumers, and ... everyone else, is growing. Big Tech companies rake it in while smaller firms struggle. Similarly, the economy is increasingly dependent on the wealthiest consumers as everyone else pinches pennies. Economists warn these imbalances make the economy more fragile. Also in this episode: Farmers experiment with agrivoltaics, a Chicago tour guide showcases the city’s architectural history, and we recap the week's economic headlines.</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3m4iico77ou2p">Speaking</a> to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on.

That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”</p>

<p>The statement from Ro Khanna, a California Democratic representative, who serves on the investigative House oversight committee, comes after the UK trade minister, Chris Bryant, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/31/ex-prince-andrew-should-answer-us-questions-on-epstein-if-asked-uk-minister-says">suggested</a> that since Mountbatten Windsor had been stripped of his royal titles, he should answer demands for information about his dealings with Epstein, an alleged sex trafficker who died by suicide while in federal custody six years ago.</p>

And later, is 9 to 5 looking more like 7 to 7? We'll learn about the rise of the work trend known as &quot;microshifting.&quot;</p>

      <p>Bhuwan Pyakurel and Kamal Subedi’s story charts a Bhutanese refugee community’s rise – and its growing political divide</p>
<p>Almost 32 years ago, in a refugee camp in eastern Nepal, children sat cross-legged around a small blackboard propped on the dirt, repeating the alphabet in sing-song rhythm. Among them was Bhuwan Pyakurel, a fourth-grader, and his teacher, Kamal Subedi, barely 18.</p>
<p>“He was tall, thin, and very talkative,” Subedi said, now 52. “We didn’t know what would happen tomorrow. So we went hut to hut, gathering kids to learn.” In the early 1990s, <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/prm/policyissues/issues/protracted/countries/157400.htm">thousands of Bhutanese refugees had arrived across seven</a> camps in the region, each day bringing more families, more children, and more uncertainty.</p>

      <h1>‘He’s a true legend’: what now for Frankie Dettori as racing’s biggest name leaves the stage?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>The last person who transcends the sport could make more headlines at the Breeders’ Cup</p>
<p>It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.</p>
<p>Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does. In a world that has been fragmented by social media and the internet, Dettori may well be the last racing figure who will ever enjoy such instant name-recognition across a broad swathe of the British population.</p>

      <p>At least two people died on Thursday in flooded basements after record rainfall in parts of New York City that also deluged some streets and subway stations. Preliminary reports showed 45.7mm (1.8in) of rain fell in Central Park, which exceeded its record of 41.7mm set in 1917, the National Weather Service said. LaGuardia airport recorded 50mm of rain, which broke the hub's 1955 record of 30mm</p>

      <p>Deeming universities too leftwing, outside donors and state governments are sponsoring curricula that center the classics, Christianity and the ‘great books’ of western civilization</p>
<p>A small conservative revolution has swept the humanities at some US colleges and universities. Its vanguard are new programs, called centers or institutes, that have begun cropping up at schools in recent years. Often funded by outside donors or earmarks from state governments, the programs tend to bear names featuring words such as “civic”, “freedom” or “classical”.</p>
<p>These centers do credible teaching and research, and are usually not explicitly political. But their goal, to counter what conservatives see as hegemonically leftwing teaching, arguably is.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans">restrict the number of refugees</a> it admits into the US next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.</p>
<p><strong>What reason has been given for prioritizing white South Africans?</strong> The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law. The South African government has called the claims false.</p>
<p><strong>What was the other shooting by ICE agents in LA recently?</strong> Last week, federal agents shot an LA man who livestreams immigration enforcement operations on social media. Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following, had attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car.</p>

<p>The historic shifts in US immigration under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> have been dictated by a relentless voice over a telephone line: Stephen Miller, the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> czar, who in recent months has turned the state department’s visa and refugee operations into what some current and former diplomats have described as a personal fiefdom.</p>
<p>Each morning, usually at 10am, a small circle of conservative diplomats allied with Miller, including those who have assumed control of the state department’s consular and refugee operations, dial in for what some have termed the “Stephen Miller call”, an interagency discussion of immigration measures led by Miller, the White House’s homeland security adviser.</p>

<p>But each year at Halloween the police shut down the street as thousands of visitors flock to the area. It’s all due to two ageing brothers who spent 40 years working together in secret at a laboratory in the CIA.</p>

      <h1>My friend Pancho’s long life is a gift. Most racehorses never get that chance | Elizabeth Banicki</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>On Breeders’ Cup weekend the thoroughbred is celebrated. My aging friend reminds me that the same industry too often steals dignity from the young horses who run for our entertainment</p>
<p>My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.</p>
<p>As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.</p>

      <p>Uncertainty surrounds the signing of this week’s trade deals amid the failure to secure reciprocity from the US to cut tariffs</p>
<p>On Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of Asia – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia">which involved stops in Malaysia, Japan and Korea</a> – the US president triumphantly collected new trade deals from countries hoping for a reduction in the tariffs he slapped on them earlier this year.</p>
<p>However – China aside – analysts were left asking just how much Asian nations got out of it.</p>

<p>Lamar Jackson threw for 204 yards and four touchdowns, showing little rust in his return from a hamstring strain, and the Baltimore Ravens routed the Miami Dolphins 28-6 on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Jackson completed 18 of 23 passes in his first start since Week 4 against Kansas City, and the Ravens won their second straight as they attempt to make a run in <a href="https://www.nfl.com/standings/">the wide-open AFC North</a>. The Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3) top the division ahead of the Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals, who have 3-5 records. The Ravens <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/schedule/">have a favorable schedule</a> going forward, and will face only one team currently over .500 – the Steelers – in their next six games. They hope to become only the fifth team in NFL history to make the playoffs after losing five of their first six games.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have pulled U.S.-China relations back from the brink. China says both sides will suspend plans to expand export controls — the U.S. on advanced tech and China on rare earths — and Trump will reduce tariffs on China’s exports by 10%. Plus, Meta stocks are down in the dumps, and the Netherlands is experiencing growing pains in the clean energy transition.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Ballydoyle squadron is at the heart of the European challenge in California this weekend</p>
<p>Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.</p>

<p>Novo Nordisk has launched a surprise $9bn (£6.9bn) offer for the US obesity-focused biotech firm Metsera that could gazump an existing bid from Pfizer as the pharmaceutical giants fight for dominance in the weight-loss market.</p>
<p>The bid comes weeks after Metsera agreed to a $7.3bn takeover from the US group Pfizer. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, which owns the weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, lost out in a competitive auction processin September.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade">Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths</a> after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>What else was agreed?</strong> Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.</p>
<p><strong>Was Taiwan discussed?</strong> No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.</p>
<p><strong>When did the U</strong> <strong>S</strong> <strong>last hold a full nuclear weapons test?</strong> In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.</p>

      <p>If nothing changes before the weekend, most of the 42 million people on food stamps, or SNAP, will not get their November benefits as scheduled. The interruption for people who rely on SNAP to buy food would be significant but could also have broader ripple effects across the economy, as SNAP generates jobs, wages, and taxes. Also: the track record of past New York City rent freezes and the likelihood of future rate cuts this year.</p>

<p>A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.</p>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>The US started off badly with a loss to Portugal, recovered a bit with a win against the same team, and finished with a romp over New Zealand</p>
<p>More than three months after their last match, the US women’s national team returned to the pitch in October, playing three games with varied results. In the first, an impressive Portugal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/23/uswnt-portugal-friendly-alex-morgan-farewell">broke down the Americans</a> in a 2-1 win for the visitors. Emma Hayes played an almost entirely different, much younger lineup in the rematch, and the Americans returned the favor, 3-1. A somehow even younger lineup in the third game <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/29/uswnt-emma-sears-hat-trick-new-zealand-friendly">steamrolled a limp New Zealand</a>, 6-0. The Portugal games offered many lessons; the Football Ferns were less scary than 11 jack-o’-lanterns would be, so that third match was more of a fun romp than a true test.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the window:</p>

      <p>With ticket sales phases under way and prices reaching eye-watering levels, my experience raised a crucial question: who is this World Cup for?</p>
<p>For months, people in my life had been asking me when and where to get World Cup tickets. In the absence of any actionable information from Fifa before the first round of the pre-sale opened up, they hoped, I guess, that I had inside knowledge.</p>

      <h1>Revealed: ICE violates its own policy by holding people in secretive rooms for days or weeks</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.</p>
<p>These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.</p>
<p>ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.</p>
<p>Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.</p>
<p>In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.</p>
<p>In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.</p>
<p>The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.</p>

      <p>Soumaya Hamdi says she has barely spoken to Sami Hamdi since he was taken over his pro-Palestinian advocacy</p>
<p>The wife of a British political commentator who was detained by immigration authorities while on a speaking tour of the US said she had only been able to speak with him for “30 seconds” since he was taken into custody on Sunday over his pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>
<p>Soumaya Hamdi told the Guardian she first learned her husband, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/ice-detains-british-muslim-journalist-laura-loomer">Sami Hamdi</a>, was detained at San Francisco international airport when a friend asked her to confirm rumors he had been “abducted by ICE”. When he was finally able to briefly call her, Hamdi only had enough time to say he had been taken to an immigration detention center in McFarland, California, where he remains.</p>

      <h1>California's public GPU infrastructure experiment</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>Graphics processing units are essential to training and deploying artificial intelligence models, but they don’t come cheap. Big Tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and xAI have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-xai-memphis-tennessee-power-dec4c70d?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh8TMJVebO4VkgnG02PFQHAGob4d-6ZCUAtiOp9-ymc1LpnDbGcp4ztR5di56s%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68e831df&amp;gaa_sig=RE-tFHO-41Hh_JS6gSRQDxI7vYowYsu3rUDmiK2hbCvCjIU3t8R_R1CXrBru2E-5JieZT-Ejr1IFapOlxpNrYQ%3D%3D">spent billions</a>, amassing hundreds of thousands or even millions of them.</p>
<p>For those without such deep pockets, access to this kind of computing power has gotten out of reach. Recently, the state of California launched an initiative called <a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260sb53">CalCompute</a> to look into building its own public GPU cluster for startups and non-profit researchers to use. There are similar public compute pilots in <a href="https://www.empireai.tech/">New York state</a> and at the <a href="https://nairrpilot.org/about">federal level</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Quarterbacks such as Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield have gone from busts to MVP candidates. The Chargers backup is in the ideal place to make a similar journey</p>
<p>The development path for young NFL quarterbacks is brutal. They get lobbed in at the deep end as franchises try to figure out if their investment was worth it, before being tossed overboard if things go wrong. The league eats its young. The path from potential franchise starter to career backup – or out of the league – has never been shorter.</p>
<p>And that path has been expedited almost by design. In part, that’s due to the rookie pay scale, which allows teams to move on from perceived misfires early. It’s also down to a shift in evaluations. Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson broke the mold for everyone. They redefined what a starting quarterback could look like, the skills needed, and the speed of development.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Nvidia's market valuation surged to $5 trillion Wednesday, breaking records. The chipmaker is on fire, and it’s using its glut of resources to invest in other tech firms that need those chips. But if companies are using Nvidia money to buy Nvidia chips … should investors fret about a bubble? Also in this episode: We unpack Trump’s trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, more families skip paid child care altogether, and the Fed cuts rates for the second time this year.</p>

      <p>Tech company brings in record quarterly revenue but major tax bill dampens earnings per share</p>
<p>Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025. The company brought in record quarterly revenue but reported a major tax bill that dampened earnings per share, the company announced on Wednesday. The financial results come as Meta ends a multibillion-dollar hiring spree focused on artificial intelligence talent.</p>
<p>The tech giant earned <span class="math inline">\(51.24bn in quarterly revenue, beating Wall Street expectations and the company’s own projections for third-quarter sales. However, it reported earnings per share (EPS) of \)</span>1.05, far below Wall Street expectations of <span class="math inline">\(6.70 in EPS. The major drop was due to a one-time non-cash income tax charge of \)</span>15.93bn. The EPS would have been $7.25 without this one-time charge, the company said.</p>

      <p>President’s effort to win $230m in damages from Mar-a-Lago and Russia investigations criticized as ‘frivolous’</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.</p>
<p>Trump has asked the justice department to pay him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html">$230m in damages</a>, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>In November 2015, in the midst of what was then considered a long-shot campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump released a book called Crippled America. In it, Trump set out his ideas about what was wrong with the US: immigrants, mostly, but also Barack Obama, the “often pathetic” media, and the “total losers” in Congress.</p>
<p>The book, the 18th in <a href="https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order">the Trump canon</a>, is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.</p>

<p>The memo, signed on 8 October by Maj Gen Ronald Burkett, the director of operations for the Pentagon’s national guard bureau, sets thresholds for the size of the quick reaction force to be trained in each state, with most states required to train 500 national guard members, for a total of 23,500 troops nationwide.</p>

<p>Pro-Palestinian students are threatening to sue George Mason University in Virginia after the school cited a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/23/antisemitism-redefinition-jewish-safety-christian-nationalism-democracy">contentious definition of antisemitism</a> it recently adopted to demand the removal of a social media post in which they described Israel as a “genocidal Zionist state” and the US as “the belly of the beast”.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to the public university’s administrators on Wednesday, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter argued that the video amounted to “political expression on a matter of public concern, and thus the very speech the first amendment is meant to protect”.</p>

      <p>Researchers figure livestock herds contribute between 12% and 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's mostly methane from the digestive process. But a study from UC Davis finds that, when fed seaweed early on, cattle’s microbiome can be altered, reducing the amount of methane emissions. But first, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point — though they have limited data to go off of.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>The Dodgers star pitched in Game 3 just 18 hours after setting records with the bat. It’s a reminder of how he makes the miraculous seem mundane</p>
<p>Even Shohei Ohtani’s teammates struggle to find the right adjectives to describe him; ones that express how good he is while emphasizing how unlikely his existence is in the first place.</p>
<p>After Monday’s Game 3, when Ohtani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/28/world-series-game-3-freeman-walkoff-ohtani-dodgers">became the first player</a> in postseason history to reach base nine times in a World Series game, Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman opted for “unicorn,” one of the more common Ohtani descriptors. Starting pitcher Blake Snell, meanwhile, put things simple and plain.</p>

<p>The 777X was central to Boeing’s long-term widebody strategy, previously dominated by its 747 and 777 jets. But repeated certification and production delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than $15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.</p>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Bankruptcies appear to be mounting in the subprime auto lending business. This all comes as auto loan delinquencies are rising, and the price of new and used cars stays stubbornly high. Amid all this, the Trump administration is quietly exploring a rollback of federal supervision of subprime auto lenders. Then, could federal law override state law that prevents medical debt from affecting your credit score? Plus, OpenAI goes from non-profit to for-profit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Correction (Oct. 29, 2025):</em></strong> <em>The introduction for the story about Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight of auto loan lenders in this episode contained an error that has been corrected. The threshold for which companies the CFPB can investigate involves how many loans those companies originate.</em></p>

Indeed, statistics show that the number of long throw-ins per match has more than doubled from last season, pointing to a very real and meaningful trend.</p>

      <h1>“China’s H-1B” talent visa gets praise abroad and backlash at home</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>Beijing is making it easier for global science and tech talent to visit or do business in China. Chinese officials opened a new K visa for graduates in science, technology, engineering and math to do research and start companies. This comes as the U.S. is cutting research grants and choking H-1B talent visas. Overseas, analysts say America’s loss could be China’s gain. But within China, there is a lot of anger over the K visa. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak explains from Shanghai.</p>

<p>Ahead of Thursday’s long-awaited first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/trump-and-xi-talks-what-will-be-on-the-agenda-when-us-president-meets-chinas-leader">meeting</a> between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping since the US president’s return to office, officials from both sides have been hammering out the contours of what a trade deal between Washington and Beijing might look like, an agreement that could bring an end to months of global economic chaos caused by the US-China trade war.</p>
<p>The two leaders have not met in person since 2019. Since then, the war in Ukraine and increasing concern in Washington about China’s technological advances, as well as longstanding issues about the imbalanced US-China trade relationship, have strained the bonds between the two superpowers.</p>

Farah Nasser says Grok asked her 12-year-old son to send it nude photos during an innocent conversation about soccer. Tesla and xAI didn't respond to CBC's questions about the interaction, sending what appeared to be an auto-generated response stating, &quot;Legacy media lies.&quot;</p>

      <p>Republicans break ranks as vote passes 52-48 in rare bipartisan rebuke of US president’s trade policies</p>
<p>The US Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would terminate Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president’s trade war.</p>
<p>The legislation passed in a 52-48 vote, with five Republicans – senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky – joining all Democrats in favor. The vote took place on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/government-shutdown-senate-vote-fails">day 28</a> of the federal government shutdown with both sides at loggerheads over spending legislation.</p>

      <p>Amazon and Chegg both announced layoffs this week; Chegg says AI competition was a factor, and Amazon’s CEO alluded to AI-related job cuts earlier this year. History tells us when a new technology comes along and totally overhauls society (think, the steam engine), we end up with new, better jobs. So … why have we only heard about AI-related job elimination?

      <p>
      <p>Federal food assistance benefits for low-income families set to expire on 1 November due to government shutdown</p>
<p>A coalition of more than two dozen states on Tuesday sued the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> over its decision to suspend food stamps during the government shutdown.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, co-led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a>, California and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, asks a federal judge to force the US Department of Agriculture to tap into emergency reserve funds to distribute food benefits to the nearly 42 million families and children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). The USDA has said no benefits will be issued on 1 November.</p>

      <h1>What a homeowners insurance bill of rights could do</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>More than half of homeowners say their insurance premiums went up in the last year, according to Consumer Reports. The biggest culprits? Inflation, construction costs, and extreme weather. In response, Consumer Reports has drawn up what it calls a &quot;Homeowners Insurance Bill of Rights,&quot; which it hopes will be adopted by states around the country. Today, we'll hear more. But first, Elon Musk has released an artificial intelligence-powered rival to Wikipedia.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Six NFL teams played in London this month. The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experience</p>
<p>It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving. Welcome to the International Series.</p>

      <p>Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office</p>
<p>US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a>’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. Nonetheless, Republicans maintained their findings cast doubt on Biden’s actions in office. And they sent a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, urging a full investigation – after Donald Trump had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/joe-biden-dismisses-donald-trump-inquiry-into-his-cognitive-decline-as-a-distraction">previously ordered a similar inquiry</a>.</p>

She opened the business next to a Haitian restaurant in 2023, having spotted a gap in the market for Caribbean and Latin foods – the neighborhood’s Haitian population was booming at the time.</p>
<p>But over the past year, she says her business, which includes an international money transfer kiosk, has taken a major hit.</p>

      <p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Co-founder accuses ice-cream brand’s parent of taking part in ‘corporate butt kissing’ of Donald Trump</p>
<p>The co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s has accused its owner of being part of a movement of “corporate butt kissing” of Donald Trump and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza.</p>
<p>Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago.</p>

      <h1>Does the central bank have enough data to go off of?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on interest rates today. Most of the government data the Fed usually considers when voting on rates isn’t available because of the shutdown. We did get a tardy consumer price index report last Friday, though, and the Fed also produces some data itself. But can that paint a clear enough economic picture? Also: why workplace insurance premiums are likely to climb.</p>

The ripple effects of his Ponzi scheme — one of the biggest frauds in Wall Street's history — are still being felt today. Now, banking giant HSBC has put aside over $1 billion for litigation related to Madoff. And later, we'll learn more about India's hard-hit carpet industry and a sports betting scandal in Turkey.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The former Raiders quarterback’s career was shortened by off-field issues. In his new book, he looks back at a complicated life</p>
<p>Marcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.</p>
<p>Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school. When Marinovich reached the NFL, it wasn’t just marijuana he was abusing.</p>

But his inclusion of alleged AI &quot;hallucinations&quot; as part of a self-represented bid to cut his property's assessed value in half may end up costing him money.</p>

<li>
<p>LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.</p>
<p>When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.</p>

<p>People who lived at Ontario Training Schools are suing the province, alleging abuse was rampant at the children's detention centres. Nearly eight years after a class action was launched, the case is still stuck in the civil system. Lawyers say it’s another casualty of underfunded courts.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has given conflicting answers to whether he will attempt to run for a third term in 2028. At first he said he hadn't really thought about it, but then went on to say he would be allowed to run as vice-president in 2028 if he wanted to. When pressed by a reporter asking whether he would rule out running for a third term, he said cryptically: ‘I mean you'll have to tell me.’ Later in the interview, however, he said he would rule out running as vice-president, saying: 'I think it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that'</p>

</ul>
<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the president has openly expressed interest in finding a way to stay in power beyond the two terms allowed in the US constitution. But his remarks on Monday provided more details into some MAGA minds’ thought process about how to pull it off.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)

</ul>
<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said: “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>

<p>The party of Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei, has won Sunday’s midterm elections after a campaign in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/argentina-president-javier-milei-polls-economic-crisis-trump">Donald Trump announced a $40bn bailout</a> for the country and made continued aid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/trump-threatens-to-cut-us-aid-to-argentina-if-milei-loses-election">conditional on the victory</a> of his Argentinian counterpart.</p>
<p>With more than 99% of ballots counted, La Libertad Avanza secured 40.8% of the nationwide vote, in an election widely seen as a de facto referendum on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/who-is-javier-milei-argentina-new-president-far-right-what-does-he-stand-for">self-styled anarcho-capitalist’s</a> nearly two years in power.

      <p>The federal shutdown is already having intense effects on unpaid federal workers. But we could be approaching a tipping point. In a memo, the USDA says about 42 million people will not get their SNAP benefits, starting Saturday. We'll hear more. Also, even if we don't get an inflation report, consumers are still pinched by rising prices. And, will Canada's transportation systems be ready for the FIFA World Cup next year?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.</p>
<p>“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">trade war truce</a> with the Chinese president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>Price increases are price increases, and consumers will bemoan inflation no matter the cause, right? Maybe not so much. Research shows that consumers tend to view inflation brought on by tariffs in a different light. Today, University of Chicago economist Alex Imas joins the program and uses behavioral economics to help make sense of it. But first, Louisiana will be building the first “rare earths separation facility” in the U.S.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p>
<p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p>
<p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p>

      <h1>Southeast Asian countries strike trade deals with U.S.</h1>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit is underway in Malaysia. So far, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Malaysia have all struck a series of trade agreements with President Donald Trump. Then, the party of Argentinian President Javier Milei saw major wins in Sunday's midterm elections, despite widespread discontent with deep austerity measures. And we'll learn about preparations for next summer’s FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted jointly by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in 16 different cities.</p>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>The four-time MVP faced his old team on Sunday night and put in a respectable performance. But it was Jordan Love who was able to control the game</p>
<p>It all started so well. And then it fell apart.</p>
<p>For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers">and a lone Super Bowl</a>. But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.</p>

<p>The Canadian Environmental Law Association is recommending that all cities pass bylaws to make it mandatory for property owners to replace lead pipes on their side of the property line. Hamilton has a bylaw aimed at preventing partial lead service-line replacements, and some Quebec and Saskatchewan have similar rules. Here's what people in Thunder Bay, Ont., have to say about the idea as the city faces a $350-million class-action lawsuit.</p>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gambling</p>
<p>The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.</p>
<p>Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims">were arrested Thursday</a> in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james">who allegedly provided</a> “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.</p>

The Bay Area region had been on edge after reports emerged the Trump administration was poised to send more than 100 Customs and Border Protection and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city in the East Bay, as part of a large-scale immigration-enforcement plan. It prompted hundreds of protesters to mobilize outside the Coast Guard base</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

      <h1>'Stupid political stunt': Vance criticises Knesset vote to annex West Bank – video</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>US vice-president has criticised Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling the move a 'stupid political stunt' after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv’s international airport before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, JD Vance insisted that 'the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren't happy about it,' adding:'I personally take some insult to it'</p>

      <h1>Beef prices and the beef of tomorrow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Tesla unveiled cheaper versions of some of its most popular cars. Other automakers are also promising to discount EVs or roll out more affordable models. This all comes following the end of federal tax credits that knocked as much as $7,500 off the price of a new EV. Also: a proposal that could grant crypto firms access to Fed infrastructure and a check-in with Cuba's tourism minister.</p>

      <p>Netflix is trying a new strategy to make more money: It's worked out a deal to stream some podcasts from Spotify, which have both audio and video. The deal means access to more consumer data and a new audience. And it's a move against a common competitor: YouTube. Also on the show: a change in tune on crytpo from a Federal Reserve leader and OpenAI's very own web browser.</p>

We'll do the numbers. And later in the program, tourism has long played a central part in Cuba’s economy. So what impact have the Trump administration’s new sanctions had?</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for tribal nations — as a force multiplier for hard-to-staff departments, a tool to better serve tribal citizens, and even to aid in the revitalization of Indigenous languages and culture.</p>
<p>But, as with all applications of AI tools, data security concerns loom. And some nations are adopting the new technology quicker than others. For an overview, Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Savannah Peters, who covers Indigenous communities for Marketplace.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration has moved to axe many Biden-era green initiatives. One project impacted is in Middletown, Ohio — the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled. Also on the show: collective bargaining rights for Uber and Lyft drivers in California and a U.S.-Australia alliance concerning rare earth metals.</p>

      <p>Silver hit an all-time high last week. Helping fuel that rally is a physical shortage; global demand for silver has been outstripping supply since 2020. We'll hear about the supply of silver, which has more industrial uses than its flashier cousin, gold. Also, a Brazilian oil giant will start drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River. And coming soon to a convenience store near you: individual mini Coke cans.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan elected its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high. But the conservative leader, who models herself after former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will have to tackle a range of economic challenges: a falling population, a rise in the cost of living, and sluggish growth. Plus, a federal green tech funding pullback in the U.S. is hitting Vice President JD Vance’s hometown.</p>

      <p>Agriculture is notoriously susceptible to the whims of the elements.

      <h1>China's leaders meet to draw up an economic blueprint</h1>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> As members of China's ruling Communist Party gather to discuss the country's economic plans for the next five years, news that growth has slowed to a one-year low hangs over proceedings. Then, Bolivia's next president has said a priority will be tackling his country’s economic crisis. And as Diwali — the Hindu festival of light — begins, we'll ask how consumers in India are dealing with the rising price of gold, which is central to gift-giving there.</p>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>California has enacted a law requiring rideshare giants Uber and Lyft to collectively bargain with their drivers. Because the drivers are technically independent contractors, they otherwise would not have federally-protected labor rights like full-time employees. The new state law could be a game changer.</p>

(date: 2025-10-17)
      <p>
      <p>Two midsize U.S. lenders claimed they were victims of loan fraud this week, sending bank stocks into a tailspin. But by close Friday, markets evened out — and for good reason: Regional banks, overall, are actually doing well. In this episode, we dispel the midsize bank sector doomsayers. Plus: Rising auto loan delinquencies could be a consumer debt canary in the coal mine, American culinary sensibilities have moved beyond “foodie” culture, and goats are the star employees in one family's landscaping business.</p>

      <h1>Thousands in the UK take Johnson & Johnson to court</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A major legal claim has been filed in the United Kingdom against pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, accusing the firm of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos. The case mirrors American litigation, where billions of dollars in damages have been awarded to plaintiffs. Plus, President Donald Trump says India will stop buying Russian oil. And, how can countries outside the biggest players — the U.S. and China — get plugged into AI infrastructure?</p>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement wants to set up an around-the-clock social media surveillance network, according to public documents reviewed by WIRED magazine.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, ICE would partner with private contractors to monitor platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for information and leads that can be passed on to officers in the field.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Dell Cameron, senior writer at WIRED who broke the story, about the proposed structure of this new surveillance program.</p>

      <p>The U.S. retail and supply chain sectors are slowing down — September’s Logistics Managers’ Index hits its lowest point since March. Many retailers are stopping shipments after stocking up early to avoid tariffs. Ongoing trade uncertainty and rising costs have companies fretting about the long term. Also in this episode: Gen Z plans to spend less this holiday season, tariffs muddle international library lending, and Colorado colleges partner with the private sector to expand skilled jobs training.</p>

Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag.

      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab.

      <h1>Fewer Chinese international students at American universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>
