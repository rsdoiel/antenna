<h2 id="our-tribute-to-cherry-blossom-season">Our tribute to cherry
blossom season</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-21, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
It’s almost peak bloom in Washington, D.C., which means it’s time for
our annual cherry blossom celebration! But first, some federal funding
news: Columbia University will give in to far-reaching demands by
President Donald Trump to restore threatened federal funding. We’ll get
into what kind of precedent the move sets for higher education. And, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture will cancel
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/21/food-banks-funding-cuts-usda-trump/">$500
million</a> in food deliveries. Rural food banks could be impacted most.
Plus, we’ll play a blossom-themed round of Half Full/Half Empty!

Not totally sure how tariffs work, who pays for them and how they’re
collected? Look no further. In today’s episode, Kai and Nova answer
these questions and more. We’ll explain how tariffs are applied and what
they’re based on, as well as what happens when a good crosses a border
multiple times. Plus, what’s the point of a country retaliating with
tariffs if its citizens have to pay for them? We’ll get into it.

President Donald Trump’s tariff fight with the European Union just got a

Apple of breaching antitrust rules. Could this escalate the EU-U.S.
trade war? We’ll also talk about the erasure of Black history and why
Elon Musk is about to be back in the money. Finally, Nova makes us smile

<em>Hey Smarties! Today we’re revisiting an episode from earlier this
year that might help you make sense of all the tit for tat tariff fight
from the past few weeks. It unpacks some tariff history and the
potential economic consequences of President Trump’s ongoing trade
war.</em>

If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping
tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn’t be the first time the U.S. has
done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930?
Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States
deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks
different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump’s
protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show
today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign
Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light
on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs
in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the
U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the
1980s film “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and Roomba vacuum cleaners!

<p>
On today’s episode, Kai Ryssdal and Kimberly Adams discuss the Donald
Trump administration’s disregard for the courts. The White House has
ignored a judge’s order to turn around a pair of deportation flights and
failed to rehire federal workers. A constitutional crisis has arrived.
Plus, get ready for a three-bleep Kai rant. And how anime helps explain
the GOP’s attempt to get around the real cost of its $4 trillion tax
cut.

A Republican-written spending bill is being backed by some Senate
Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to avoid a
government shutdown. Other Democrats — and much of the voter base —
aren’t happy. We’ll get into it. Then, we’ll close out the week with a
round of Half Full/Half Empty, weighing in on Southwest Airlines’ new
checked bag policy and $19 strawberries. Plus, in the wake of a certain
duchess’ foray into television, what are your thoughts on celeb cooking
shows?
