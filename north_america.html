<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Five years ago, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a
pandemic. Since then, there have been lockdowns, a recession, two
presidential elections and more than a million American lives lost from
the disease. In many ways, life feels like it’s back to normal, but
David Wallace-Wells, a writer for The New York Times, argues that the
pandemic still has a grip on American life, from our faith in public
health institutions to the way consumers feel about the economy. On the
show today, Wallace-Wells walks us through how Americans neglected to
process the seismic impact of the pandemic in the rush to recover from
it, and how it’s left us more self-interested and less empathetic. Plus,
how this can help explain disgruntled consumers and a growing appetite
for risk-taking in the economy.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Then, we’ll get into how responses to public health emergencies have
shifted to the realm of the private sector. And, we’ll hear listeners’
reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic, five years on.

On today’s episode, Kai and Kimberly discuss the future of Biden-era
clean energy tax credits under Trump 2.0. A group of GOP lawmakers want
them to stay. Meanwhile, the administration is rescinding memos that
pushed for climate change-resilient infrastructure. Plus, the hosts
weigh in on the arrest of a Palestinian activist and Columbia University
student by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Is this the first
arrest of “many to come?” Finally, we’ll smile as the cherry blossoms in
Washington, D.C., get closer to full bloom.
