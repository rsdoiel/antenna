calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in
Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an
immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with
French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv “would like to make a deal”
to end the more than 1,000-day war. </p>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and
Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that
“should never have started.” </p>
<p>“There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should
begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families
destroyed,” he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to
act to bring the fighting to an end. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel
Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as “constructive”. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any
peace deal “should be just” for Ukrainians, “so that Russia and Putin or
any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.” </p>
<p>In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that
Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow’s all-out invasion on
Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. </p>
<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official
casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few
months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant
record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded
each month.</p>

oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe
age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials
said. </p>
<p>The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to
Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the
Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg,
the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said in a
Facebook post this week. </p>
<p>Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the
Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate
for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for
several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she
returned last week, officials said. </p>
<p>“We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,” Jonathan Plissner,
supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge,
said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the
refuge to nest and raise their young. </p>
<p>Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months.
Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They
spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and
fish eggs. </p>
<p>Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as
30 chicks, Plissner said. </p>
<p>The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

id="as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows">As
data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the
rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia.
He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes
and neighbors wave hello.</p>
<p>But now, as he’s approaching 60, he’s considering selling his Fairfax
County home and moving away. That’s because he’s getting a new neighbor:
Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical
substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds
and a community center.</p>
<p>Newman feels helpless to stop it.</p>
<p>“I planned on staying here until I died,” he said, “until this came
up.”</p>
<p>The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed
servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and
computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape,
popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.</p>
<p>Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid
growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local
governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.
But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas,
abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents
are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over
concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their
communities.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight
against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough
to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to
homes.</p>
<p>“All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in
this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn’t
run residents away from their homes,” he said.</p>
<p>Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia</p>
<p>In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling
hills of the area’s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular
Washington &amp; Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data
centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation’s
capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.</p>
<p>Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on
neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners
association in the community.</p>
<p>The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm
founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials
promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent
positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction
and electrical jobs to build the facility.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022,
hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green
space.</p>
<p>But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping
out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for
the Plaza 500 project.</p>
<p>When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held
protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to
their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were
largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in
September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter
zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under
the old rules.</p>
<p>Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the
already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia
in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by
2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates
also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every
day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray
also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help
power the data centers’ hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this
story.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how a general resident, even someone who has been
engaging intently on an issue,” Ray said, “has any chance to go up
against the data center industry.”</p>
<p>Local leaders say data centers a financial boon</p>
<p>For local governments, attracting data centers to their
municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said
in 2024 that Virginia’s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in
tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech
companies that own them in 2023.</p>
<p>For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of
direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently
that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000
residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center
advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction,
technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In
that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730
indirect jobs.</p>
<p>Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her
estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax
County should reap the benefits.</p>
<p>“I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the
big picture,” Smith said. “Data centers are not going away.”</p>
<p>Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon </p>
<p>On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon
Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the
4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland
flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia
river.</p>
<p>Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in
property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a
$66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in
two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another
$1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.</p>
<p>That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and
bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a
new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras,
and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.</p>
<p>Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals.
Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials
allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a
company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the
data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics
complaint against them.</p>
<p>Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the
relationships between the company and local officials, and raised
eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an
estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build
five new data centers.</p>
<p>Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS
officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant
in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.</p>
<p>The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a
commissioner. “They said, ‘Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what
you need. Tell us what we can do for you,’” Doherty recalled. Other
former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS
didn’t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.</p>
<p>“We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate
around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a
community’s goals,” said Kevin Miller, AWS’ Vice President of global
data centers. “This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve
those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good
neighbors.”</p>
<p>Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said
they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new
data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to
negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of
AWS-suited lawyers.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to blow it up. We didn’t want to run them off,” said
Lindsay. “But there were better deals to be made.”</p>
<p>Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their
direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.</p>
<p>“This road right here? Wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t for AWS,” said
Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe’s cruiser, pointing out
the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.
Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to
authorize tax breaks for AWS.</p>
<p>“These companies would not be here if they weren’t getting some kind
of incentive,” Stokoe said. “There wouldn’t be any money to talk
about.”</p>

id="white-house-on-guard-against-islamic-state-resurgence-in-syria">White
House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in
Syria now are to ensure the country’s conflict does not encourage a
resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a
“humanitarian catastrophe.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the
“extraordinary events in Syria” are in touch with regional partners, the
White House said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the
extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with
regional partners,” the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Spillover “is a concern,” said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also
known as ISIS.</p>
<p>In previous phases of Syria’s long-running civil war, “at its worst,
we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,” he said at a conference in
Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum.</p>
<p>The main priority is to ensure “that the fighting in Syria not lead
to a resurgence of ISIS,” Sullivan said. “We are going to take steps
ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the
Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working
with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the
AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would
affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. “It’s still too
early to tell,” he said.</p>
<p>What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in
Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the
Reagan event.</p>
<p>Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they
have begun to encircle Syria’s capital, Damascus.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies
Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, “who would potentially
face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we’re in
touch with them every day.”</p>
<p>Washington is also alert to stopping a “humanitarian catastrophe,
both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in
terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,”
Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to
take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying … to reconstitute to
a certain extent.”</p>
<p>So the United States will seek to “contain the potential violence and
instability,” protect allies and ensure that ISIS not “get new oxygen
out of this” that could lead them to threaten US or allies’ interests,
Sullivan added.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of
power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated
Biden in November’s election.</p>
<p>Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement
in Syria, saying the country is “a mess” and “not our friend.”</p>
<p>“THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Sullivan, addressing Trump’s remarks, agreed, saying “the United
States is not going to… militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian
civil war.”</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms
equipment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next
week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for
U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms
firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to
address security risks.</p>
<p>The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other
provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese
efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence
assessment of the current status of China’s biotechnology
capabilities.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure
equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously
only approved $1.9 billion for the “rip and replace” program.</p>
<p>Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and
other Chinese gear from their wireless networks.</p>
<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S.
Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to
replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion
shortfall “putting both our national security and the connectivity of
rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.”</p>
<p>She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural
networks shutting down, which “could eliminate the only provider in some
regions” and could threaten 911 service.</p>
<p>Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised
the announcement, saying “funding is desperately needed to fulfill the
mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while
maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that
receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms
equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the
program.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the
program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by
funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced
wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising
spectrum demands of wireless consumers.</p>

id="pearl-harbor-survivors-ages-104-and-102-return-to-hawaii-for-attack-anniversary">Pearl
Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack
anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira “Ike” Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor
attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a
remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that
thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six
weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his
right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a
submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him
from either side.</p>
<p>“I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,” he
said afterward. “I’m getting old, you know.”</p>
<p>Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who
made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National
Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor
had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health
issues.</p>
<p>The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen.
Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS
Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900
Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.</p>
<p>Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has
declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living,
according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state
chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military
historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000
military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.</p>
<p>Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to
salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans.</p>
<p>“He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,” said his daughter
Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their
Beaverton, Oregon, home. “He wanted to be able to stand for that.”</p>
<p>Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack,
serving as the tuba player in the ship’s band. He had showered and put
on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party.</p>
<p>He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS
Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of
sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside.</p>
<p>Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the
ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due
to health issues.</p>
<p>Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time
the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation
flew overhead shortly after.</p>
<p>Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he
lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as
the attack began.</p>
<p>“When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,”
Fernandez said. “We didn’t even know we were in a war.”</p>
<p>Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was
to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast.
Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a
plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly
by.</p>
<p>Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and
other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing
12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to
the ship’s guns.</p>
<p>He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow
sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.</p>
<p>“I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going
on,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>The ship’s guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its
cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into
the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on
fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.</p>
<p>Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its
sailors were injured.</p>
<p>Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t
view himself that way.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hero,” he said. “I’m just nothing but an ammunition
passer.”</p>

id="garlands-ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-auctioned-for-28m">Garland’s
ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ auctioned for $28M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy
Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades
ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or
more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55
million, or $1.91 million including the buyer’s premium, a commission
that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the
Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the
slippers, and the company’s web page for the auction had hit nearly
43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it,
the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen “more twists
and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.”</p>
<p>They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of
Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to
smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case.</p>
<p>Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in
2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota,
wasn’t publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023.
He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on
supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served
because of his poor health.</p>
<p>His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin,
who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was
attempting to pull off “one last score” after an old associate with
connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real
jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person
who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass,
DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn’t
specify how.</p>
<p>The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis
suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair
and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He’s scheduled to
go on trial in January and hasn’t entered a plea, though his attorney
has said he’s not guilty.</p>
<p>The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael
Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs
that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to
have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to
click her heels three times and repeat, “There’s no place like
home.”</p>
<p>Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand
Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival
to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to
help the museum purchase the slippers.</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with
the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway
musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
<p>The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz,
such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>

<h2 id="us-announces-nearly-1-billion-in-military-aid-for-ukraine">US
announces nearly $1 billion in military aid for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Saturday announced a new $988
million military assistance package for Ukraine as Washington races to
provide aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes
office. </p>
<p>It nearly halves the available $2.21 billion remaining in Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) as the Biden administration works
to commit to buying weapons from industry, rather than pull from U.S.
weapons stocks. </p>
<p>Trump’s victory in the November election has cast doubt on the future
of American aid for Ukraine, providing a limited window for billions of
dollars in already authorized assistance to be provided before he is
sworn in next month.  </p>
<p>The package features drones, ammunition for precision HIMARS rocket
launchers, and equipment and spare parts for artillery systems, tanks
and armored vehicles, the Pentagon said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has often used Presidential Drawdown
Authority, which authorizes President Joe Biden to transfer excess
articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval
during an emergency. </p>
<p>The USAI funds are separate and will go to purchase new weapons from
the defense industry or partners rather than drawn from American stocks,
meaning it will not immediately arrive on the battlefield. </p>
<p>It follows a $725 million package announced Monday that included a
second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor
weapons. </p>
<p>The outgoing U.S. administration is working to get as much aid as
possible to Ukraine before Trump — who has repeatedly criticized U.S.
assistance for Kyiv and claimed he could secure a ceasefire within hours
— takes over. </p>
<p>Trump’s comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the
future of U.S. aid, and Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian attacks
in the absence of further American support. </p>
<p>The United States has spearheaded the push for international support
for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia
launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and coordinating aid from
dozens of countries. </p>
<p>Ukraine’s international supporters have since then provided tens of
billions of dollars in weapons, ammunition, training and other security
aid that has been key to helping Kyiv resist Russian forces. </p>
<p>The Biden administration still has about $6 billion of
congressionally granted presidential drawdown authority, including funds
authorized in 2024 and funds discovered by the Pentagon after
overestimating the value of arms shipped to Ukraine. </p>
<p>Since the Russian invasion in February 2022 the U.S. has committed
more than $62 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine. </p>

id="net-is-tightening-on-man-suspected-of-shooting-executive-says-official">‘Net
is tightening’ on man suspected of shooting executive, says
official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York’s mayor said Saturday “the net is tightening” on
the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive
before fleeing the city. </p>
<p>Mayor Eric Adams said detectives knew the name of the fresh-faced
suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators Thursday and who
has now been on the run for almost four days. </p>
<p>Adams praised “the manner in which (investigators) were able to
follow his footsteps to recover evidence — some of it is known, some of
it is unknown — but the net is tightening and we’re going to bring this
person to justice,” he said, the New York Post reported. </p>
<p>Adams was quoted by the Post as saying the police were withholding
the suspect’s name for now. </p>
<p>“We don’t want to release that,” the mayor said. “If you do, you are
basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking, and we do not want
to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can
hide behind the mask.” </p>
<p>“We revealed his face,” the mayor continued, referring to numerous
security camera photos and video released after Brian Thompson, CEO of
UnitedHealthcare was gunned down. And eventually, “we’re going to reveal
who he is and we’re going to bring him to justice,” Adams said. </p>
<p>The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a
northern neighborhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday’s slaying,
but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police
spokesperson confirmed to Agence France-Presse. </p>
<p>“They believe he’s not in New York City,” the spokesperson
added. </p>
<p>The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel
where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with
media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist. </p>
<p>The FBI, which said it was assisting the New York police, offered a
reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his capture. </p>
<p>‘Delay’ and ‘deny’ </p>
<p>The gunman on Wednesday sprayed Thompson of United Healthcare — one
of the country’s largest medical insurers — with bullets in front of
bystanders, in an audacious attack captured by a surveillance camera and
now seen by millions. </p>
<p>Thompson was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business
district. </p>
<p>Police have yet to suggest a motive and would not confirm media
reports that the words “delay” and “deny” — often used by insurance
companies to reject claims — were written on shell casings found at the
scene. </p>
<p>Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York
Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, his lower face covered,
approaches from behind, then fires several shots at his 50-year-old
victim, who crumples to the ground. </p>
<p>Camera footage showed the suspect fleeing on foot, before getting on
a bicycle, with police revealing he headed to Central Park. </p>
<p>Officers have confirmed that a cell phone as well as DNA from a
coffee cup were recovered from near the murder scene. </p>
<p>In the absence of an arrest, speculation has been rife that the
gunman may have sought revenge for adverse medical coverage decisions
made by the insurer. </p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare is a major player in the lucrative American health
care market; the parent group had revenues of $100.8 billion in the
third quarter of the year.</p>

id="macron-welcomes-trump-to-paris-with-presidential-pomp-joined-by-zelenskyy">Macron
welcomes Trump to Paris with presidential pomp, joined by Zelenskyy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to
Paris on Saturday with a full dose of presidential pomp as the two held
a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before
celebrating the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>
<p>On a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global
problems, the once and future American president was warmly embraced by
Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years
later,” Macron told Trump. “Welcome back again.”</p>
<p>Trump said it was a “very great honor” to be there, while hinting at
challenges ahead.</p>
<p>“It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now.
And we’ll be talking about that,” Trump said.</p>
<p>An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the
kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American
presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican
Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump
doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European
leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as
America’s representative on the world stage.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame
ceremony, five years after a devastating fire, with the White House
citing a scheduling conflict. First lady Jill Biden was the official
U.S. representative in his place.</p>
<p>Macron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the
president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against
Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in
the Mideast, would be discussed.</p>
<p>As Trump arrived at the official residence of the French president,
Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, offering
handshakes and plenty of back-patting for the cameras.</p>
<p>In a video posted later on X, Macron could be heard asking Trump:
“You remember?” as both men entered a reception room.</p>
<p>“I remember,” Trump answered.</p>
<p>Trump spent about 90 minutes inside, meeting first with Macron before
they were joined by Zelenskyy for about 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Macron had long planned to meet separately with Zelenskyy. The French
president’s office said the three-way talks were proposed by Macron and
arranged shortly before Trump’s arrival. Trump has pledged to end the
war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in
Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.</p>
<p>A person familiar with Trump’s plans had said before the meeting was
announced that while Trump and Zelenskyy were attending the cathedral
ceremony and surrounding events and probably would interact, Trump’s
transition team had not worked with the Ukrainians to schedule formal
talks.</p>
<p>After the place meeting, a Trump senior transition official did not
push back on the idea that it had come together at the last minute, but
said it had been “discussed fully and agreed to” and that Trump had been
“fully briefed” ahead of time.</p>
<p>The three leaders spoke in English, and translator was in the room,
according to a French official.</p>
<p>Accompanying Trump to Paris was a small contingent of advisers that
included incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with Steve Witkoff,
a longtime friend and real estate investor whom Trump has tapped as his
special envoy to the Middle East, and Massad Boulos, who is the
father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and will serve as senior
adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. </p>
<p>The group did not appear to include anyone with expertise on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“United States, Ukraine and France. Together on this historic day.
United for Notre-Dame. Let’s continue to work together for peace and
security,” Macron wrote on X afterward.</p>
<p>Trump’s victory last month threw into doubt the Biden
administration’s flow of money and arms to Ukraine — aid bolstered even
more on Saturday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s announcement
of a $988 million package that brings American military support to more
than $62 billion since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.</p>
<p>Trump has characterized Zelenskyy as “the greatest salesman on Earth”
for winning billions in U.S. aid. Trump also has said he work out a
peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within a day of taking office and
has promoted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>In an effort to build trust with the incoming U.S. administration,
Zelenskyy’s top aide Andriy Yermak met key members of Trump’s team on a
two-day trip to the U.S. earlier this week.</p>
<p>Macron has argued that Ukraine’s defeat or a cease-fire with Russia
on unfavorable terms to Ukraine would be viewed as a loss for the U.S.
and even Trump himself, according to two European officials familiar
with the matter.</p>
<p>After arriving at Notre Dame for the ceremony, Trump was greeted by
Macron and his wife, Brigitte. He was given prime seating at the service
right between them — a better location than Jill Biden, who sat on
Brigitte Macron’s other side — and many current heads of government and
state. </p>
<p>Inside, Trump also greeted Zelenskyy as well as Britain’s Prince
William, who Trump met with later at the British ambassador’s residence
in Paris. Trump was greeted in the foyer, shook the royal’s hand and
said “good man, this one.”</p>
<p>Trump told reporters the Prince of Wales was doing “a fantastic job”
before the two went to sit down and talk in a private room reserved for
high-profile figures in the residence that once was the Paris town home
of Princess Pauline Borghese, the youngest sister French Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Prince William was also scheduled to meet separately with Jill Biden,
according to the British royal palace.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and X who has spent
considerable time with Trump since the election and spent millions to
elect him, was also in attendance at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made
a point of cultivating their bond since the Republican defeated Democrat
Kamala Harris. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the
significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in
office had been invited as well.</p>
<p>Trump was invited as president-elect of a “friendly nation,” Macron’s
office said, adding, “This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it
before.” </p>
<p>Trump is known to revel in pomp and circumstance. One of his first
trips as president his first term was to Paris, where Macron made him
the the guest of honor at Bastille Day events. Trump later said he
wanted to replicate the grand military parade back in the United
States.</p>
<p>Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began
warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.</p>
<p>Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and
Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered
after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and
raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual defense
pact.</p>
<p>During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump often mocked Macron,
imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and
champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American
companies.</p>
<p>But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump
last month after the election.</p>
<p>When he accepted the invitation to travel to Paris, Trump said Macron
had done “a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to
its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day
for all!” Trump was president in 2019, when a fire nearly destroyed the
861-year-old landmark.</p>

id="trump-says-that-us-should-not-get-involved-in-conflict-in-syria">Trump
says that US should ‘not get involved’ in conflict in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday the U.S.
should not be involved in the conflict in Syria, where rebel forces are
threatening the government of President Bashar Assad.</p>
<p>“Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY
OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!,” Trump said in a post on his social media
platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump said because Russia, an Assad ally, is tied up fighting a war
with Ukraine, it “seems incapable of stopping this literal march through
Syria, a country they have protected for years.”</p>
<p>If Russia were forced out of Syria, it “may actually be the best
thing that can happen to them” because “there was never much of a
benefit in Syria for Russia,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments appeared to reflect his opposition to the presence
of some 900 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly of them in the northeast, where
they have backed a Syrian Kurd-led alliance in preventing a resurgence
of Islamic State militants.</p>
<p>Trump announced in 2018 during his first term that he wanted to
withdraw the U.S. troops because he said Islamic State was near
defeat.</p>
<p>But he held off as advisers warned that a pullout would leave a void
that would be filled by Iran and Russia.</p>

<h2 id="us-to-observe-83rd-anniversary-of-attack-on-pearl-harbor">US to
observe 83rd anniversary of attack on Pearl Harbor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor “changed the future of the world,” U.S. President Joe
Biden said at a White House event for veterans and their families on
Friday, the eve of the anniversary of Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl
Harbor.</p>
<p>The president recalled that he “heard so much” about Pearl Harbor
when he was growing up and talked about his uncles who enlisted in the
military after the attack.</p>
<p>“During World War II, we stood at an inflection point,” the president
said.  “We still stand at an inflection point. The decisions we make now
in the next four to five years will determine the course of our future
for decades to come. … We owe it to the next generation to set that
course on a more free, more secure and more just path.”</p>
<p>Saturday, December 7, marks the 83rd anniversary of Japan’s surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor, a U.S. naval base on the island of Oahu, Hawaii,
near Honolulu.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Japanese fighter planes unleashed bombs, bullets and
aerial torpedoes on America’s Pacific Fleet in the Sunday morning
attack.</p>
<p>More than 2,400 U.S. sailors, soldiers and civilians were killed that
day. About half of them died on the USS Arizona battleship.</p>
<p>The Japanese succeeded in sinking four of the eight U.S. battleships
at Pearl Harbor and damaging the remaining four.</p>
<p>According to the Naval History and History Command website, “That
more Japanese aircraft were not shot down had nothing to do with the
skill, training or bravery of our Sailors and other servicemembers.</p>
<p>“Rather, U.S. antiaircraft weapons were inadequate in number and
capability, for not only had the Japanese achieved tactical surprise,
they achieved technological surprise with aircraft and weapons far
better than anticipated — a lesson in the danger of underestimating the
enemy that resonates to this day.”</p>
<p>The day after the attack, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt appeared
before a joint session of Congress, seeking a declaration of war. After
he delivered his famous “Day of Infamy” speech, the Senate unanimously
supported the declaration. In the House, there was one dissenter,
Montana’s Representative Jeanette Rankin, a pacifist.</p>
<p>Roosevelt signed the declaration Monday afternoon. The United States
had now been officially drawn into World War II.</p>
<p>Before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had
imposed economic sanctions on Japan as a way of stopping Japan’s
expansion goals in Asia. The sanctions affected Japan’s access to
aircraft exports.</p>
<p>The attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was part of
Japan’s plan to prevent any challenges to those goals in Asia.</p>
<p>There is now a USS Arizona Memorial that expands over the hull of the
sunken vessel without touching it.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 104-year-old survivor of Pearl Harbor returned
to Hawaii to participate in this year’s commemorations. Ira “Ike” Schab
Jr. of Portland, Oregon, who was a Navy musician, was greeted at the
airport in Honolulu with a water cannon salute and music from the U.S.
Pacific Fleet Band.</p>
<p>When asked what he remembers about that day, Schab told the Hawaii
News Now website, “Being scared, more than anything else.” Schab said he
made the trip because he is one of the Pacific Fleet’s “very few”
survivors remaining from that day.</p>
<p>He said, “They deserve to be recognized and honored.”</p>

<h2
id="maternal-mortality-review-panels-are-in-the-spotlight.-heres-what-they-do">Maternal
mortality review panels are in the spotlight. Here’s what they do</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Efforts to reduce the nation’s persistently high maternal mortality
rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from
each mother’s death.</p>
<p>The panels — called maternal mortality review committees — usually do
their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that’s not been the
case recently in three states with strict abortion laws.</p>
<p>Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after
information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization
ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas’
committee won’t review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years
after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its
panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year.</p>
<p>“They’ve become more of a lightning rod than they were before,” said
epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health
and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia.</p>
<p>Here’s what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do
and what might happen next:</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>“Maternal mortality review committees are important because they are
the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality
that we have,” said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality
prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</p>
<p>The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year
after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes
of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses
to traffic accidents.</p>
<p>The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help “decide
what we can do about them.”</p>
<p>All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their
membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine
doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members
of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas
of expertise, which the CDC recommends.</p>
<p>How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit
letters of interest or be invited to serve.</p>
<p>The selection shouldn’t be politically motivated, Kramer said,
because “if there’s a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain
perspectives” it’s difficult to truly understand what’s happening.</p>
<p>How do they look at deaths?</p>
<p>First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and
epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by
examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a
related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and
fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media
reports and obituaries.</p>
<p>Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as
possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service
records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members.
Professional “abstractors” distill all this into case narratives, which
committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process
developed by the CDC — and all panels can get help and guidance from the
agency.</p>
<p>They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related?
What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors
contributed?</p>
<p>States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members
and people who provide information on the deaths.</p>
<p>The groups then issue public reports that don’t name moms or
hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some
come out a couple of years or more after the deaths.</p>
<p>Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from
those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical
professionals and policymakers.</p>
<p>What about Georgia, Texas and Idaho?</p>
<p>Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process,
the state public health commissioner said.</p>
<p>Texas’ committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on
2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health
Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>“Reviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for
more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will
allow us to provide that in the next report,” Anton said, adding that
maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and
publish data for 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the
state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state’s
health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said
Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the

YouTuber moves millions of followers to donate millions for charity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sean McLoughlin wears a lot of hats: YouTuber. Voice
actor. Coffee entrepreneur. But McLoughlin, better known by his
pseudonym Jacksepticeye, likes to say he would be a therapist if he
wasn’t posting video game playthroughs for his nearly 31 million
subscribers. </p>
<p>The 34-year-old Irish creator finds that gaming enthusiasts aren’t
just drawn by his expressive reactions to the latest action role-playing
games; fans also resonate with his candid discussions of mental health.
The supportive responses from his niche but passionate following make
McLoughlin feel “less alone,” he said, forging the same camaraderie that
brought him to online gaming communities as a lonely 20-something living
at his family’s remote home. </p>
<p>That shared connection is also central to his annual fundraiser,
“Thankmas.” The charity livestream is one of many online specials
emerging as a modern spin on the classic telethon. Total donations have
increased more than 50% over the last year on Tiltify, a digital
platform that integrates giving tools into streams. The spaces are
credited for allowing more authentic interactions between nonprofits and
young donors — and encouraging benevolence in a corner of the web marked
by incendiary rhetoric. </p>
<p>“If you want to do good things, the people are there, and they’ll
listen,” McLoughlin said. “They’re already following you for what you do
for a reason. So they’ll follow you to help out people as well.” </p>
<p>Follow they have. His streams have raked in more than $26 million,
according to partner Tiltify. This year’s goal is to collect $6 million
for two nonprofits supporting mental health: Crisis Text Line and
Samaritans. </p>
<p>A seven-figure target would have seemed a longshot when McLoughlin
entered the space. The initial idea was to hold monthly fundraisers. He
hosted seven charitable streams in 2018, Tiltify records show, for
causes including pediatric cancer and clean water. The year culminated
in the inaugural “Thankmas,” which pulled over a quarter of a million
dollars. </p>
<p>But McLoughlin said the pace became “a bit much.” That same year he
announced a brief break from YouTube, in part due to unhappiness from
the demands he felt for high content volumes. He resolved to focus on
one big holiday event at the end of the year, when he said people are “a
bit more giving and heartfelt.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2020 that Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman said the two
began working closely to maximize the streams’ reach. McLoughlin reached
out, according to Wasserman, and said he wanted something “more
impactful.” With communities worldwide reeling from the pandemic, they
put together the #HopeFromHome campaign: a peer-to-peer event where
multitudes could simultaneously rally around the same cause. McLoughlin
served as a tent pole supporting the other streamers. </p>
<p>Their first effort together yielded $1.9 million for United Way
Worldwide and more than one-third came from McLoughlin’s stream alone.
The following “Thankmas” generated more than $4.7 million. Wasserman
said he’d never seen his technology used so collaboratively. </p>
<p>“That’s what really made this a regular, multimillion-dollar event,”
Wasserman said. “Not just making it, ‘Hey I’m going to fundraise and
just watch me,’ but, ‘We as a community can do this and get involved
together.’” </p>
<p>Specials feature calls, celebrities</p>
<p>This year’s “Thankmas” will be performed before a live audience in
Los Angeles but broadcast online. Recent specials have seen McLoughlin
make surprise calls into streams that are also pooling contributions.
Comedic segments sometimes feature traditional celebrities; actor Jack
Black played a life-sized game of Jenga in 2022. </p>
<p>The idea resembles the star-studded telethon pioneered last century
by comedian Jerry Lewis. But new technologies and web cultures enable
more engaging experiences. Wasserman said charitable livestreams like
McLoughlin’s are not a “passive watching experience.” </p>
<p>It’s “a much more personable approach to giving,” according to Yvette
Wohn, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies
human-computer interaction. </p>
<p>A streamer’s audience “cares about them,” Wohn said, and donors flock
to their content because “they really like that person.” Social media
and chat boxes allow fans to feel seen by hosts in ways television
viewers could never expect. Followers might get shoutouts by name upon
contributing. McLoughlin has previously shared fan art submitted through
specific hashtags. </p>
<p>Fandoms also develop subcultures. McLoughlin’s gaming catchphrases
are especially popular among his circles. Jacksepticeye content often
starts with him shouting, “Top of the morning to ya, laddies!” and fans
have uploaded video compilations of the expression. Members then form
friendships with others in the fandom. That creates a “positive social
pressure” to donate, according to Wohn, helping new generations “dip
their toes into building an identity as somebody that gives.” </p>
<p>“Giving habits are things that build over time,” Wohn said. “If
younger people start to engage in this culture of giving, I feel like
the general culture of giving might expand in ways that cannot be done
from a top-down perspective.” </p>
<p>Online communities offer kinship</p>
<p>Still, McLoughlin describes online communities as a “double-edged
sword.” The “monetization of hate,” he said, is “bigger than it’s ever
been.” And the desire for acceptance can introduce lonely people to dark
pockets of the internet that nevertheless provide kinship. </p>
<p>“Thankmas” aims to prove it’s easy to do good online. Yes, he
acknowledged, charity work is “quite intimidating.” Where is the line
between promoting the fundraiser and promoting himself? McLoughlin
doesn’t know. He just hopes people trust it’s coming from the right
place. </p>
<p>At least one longtime follower was drawn by McLoughlin’s ties to this
year’s cause. Jack Worthey, a 20-year-old from Texas, said McLoughlin
brought much comfort growing up with “similar family troubles.” It had
been several years since he watched Jacksepticeye content, he said, but
he was pulled back by an October video where McLoughlin detailed his
journey finding mental health treatment. </p>
<p>Worthey said he wouldn’t have looked into “Thankmas” had McLoughlin
had not made the promotion so personal. He now plans to raise awareness
through digital art. For Worthey, returning to the channel as an adult
and seeing the “positive product” has been “really amazing.” </p>
<p>“It makes you see what I was enjoying when I was younger in a
different light,” Worthey said. “It brings a different type of joy.”</p>

<h2 id="appeals-court-upholds-law-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-us">Appeals
court upholds law that could ban TikTok in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday upheld a law
requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be sold to a
non-Chinese owner or face closure in the United States by next month.
The court cited “persuasive” and “compelling” arguments presented by the
federal government that TikTok poses a risk to national security.</p>
<p>The ruling could leave the 170 million Americans who regularly use
TikTok without access to a social media platform that has enjoyed
explosive global growth in recent years. It could also mean that the
millions of Americans who create content for TikTok — some of whom rely
on monetizing that content for their livelihood — could be cut off from
their audiences.</p>
<p>The government has argued that TikTok presents a unique danger to
national security because it collects vast amounts of information about
its users, and because the Chinese government ultimately exercises
control over its parent company, ByteDance, and over the algorithm that
determines what content TikTok users see.</p>
<p>Because ByteDance is in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) it is
subject to that country’s laws, including measures requiring private
companies to cooperate with government intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit found that the government has a compelling interest
in taking steps “to counter the PRC’s efforts to collect great
quantities of data about tens of millions of Americans” and “to limit
the PRC’s ability to manipulate content covertly on the TikTok
platform.”</p>
<p>TikTok signals an appeal</p>
<p>TikTok immediately signaled that it would appeal the circuit court’s
ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to its website, the company said, “The Supreme
Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’
right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this
important constitutional issue.”</p>
<p>The company said that the law underlying the case “was conceived and
pushed through based on inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information,
resulting in outright censorship of the American people,” and warned
that it “will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in
the U.S. and around the world.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is not obligated to hear the company’s appeal, and
it was not immediately clear that it would do so. If the high court
accepts the case, it is possible that it would block the government from
enforcing the law until the case is decided.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a TikTok ban before
changing his mind during the recent presidential election, has suggested
that he will act to save the app when he takes office. However, it is
unclear what options he might have for doing that.</p>
<p>Lack of trust</p>
<p>In April, President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from
Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act into law. The measure gave
TikTok 270 days to find a way to separate itself from ByteDance before a
ban on the application would kick in on January 19, 2025.</p>
<p>The federal government made it clear that the only kind of
divestiture that it would accept was a complete separation of TikTok
from its Chinese parent. The company offered alternatives, and
established TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc. (TTUSDS) as a subsidiary in
Delaware, to wall off U.S. user data from ByteDance.</p>
<p>However, the government cited instances in which U.S. user data that
the company claimed to have shielded from the PRC was, in fact,
accessible to ByteDance employees in mainland China. It told the court
that it lacked “the requisite trust” that “ByteDance and TTUSDS would
comply in good faith” with any arrangement other than complete
separation of TikTok and ByteDance.</p>
<p>In Friday’s ruling, the judges wrote, “The court can neither fault
nor second-guess the government on these crucial points.”</p>
<p>First Amendment concerns</p>
<p>TikTok and its supporters have claimed that severing TikTok from
ByteDance is both practically impossible for technological reasons and
legally impossible because the Chinese government will block the sale of
the company. Therefore, they claim, the law constitutes a de facto ban
and a violation of the guarantee of free speech enshrined in the First
Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>In a sign of how seriously the court took the First Amendment
arguments, the panel of judges agreed that the law should be subject to
“heightened scrutiny,” which the Supreme Court has applied to measures
restricting fundamental rights.</p>
<p>In the end, the panel determined that the law satisfies even the most
stringent form of “strict scrutiny,” which requires that the government
“prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is
narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.”</p>
<p>Free speech advocates respond</p>
<p>The decision came under immediate criticism from free speech
advocates.</p>
<p>“Although we’re still analyzing the decision, we find it deeply
disappointing,” David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, said in a statement emailed to VOA. “The court
appropriately applied strict scrutiny as we have urged it to. But the
strict-scrutiny analysis is lacking, relying heavily on speculation
about possible future harms.</p>
<p>“Restricting the free flow of information, even from foreign
adversaries, is fundamentally undemocratic,” Greene said. “Until now,
the U.S. has championed the free flow of information and called out
other nations when they have shut down internet access or banned online
communications tools like social media apps.”</p>
<p>George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute
at Columbia University, told VOA that the court accorded “a shocking
amount of deference” to the government’s claims about the danger TikTok
poses to national security.</p>
<p>“We should be really wary whenever we allow the government to use
vague national security arguments as a justification to shut down
speech,” Wang said. “That’s a tactic of authoritarian regimes, not
democracies. It’s usually the job of courts to stand up to the
government when it infringes on the constitutional rights of millions of
Americans, and I think the D.C. Circuit really didn’t do that
today.”</p>
<p>‘A victory for the American people’</p>
<p>Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the senior Democrat on the House
Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States
and the Chinese Communist Party, and one of the original sponsors of the
law requiring TikTok’s divestiture or ban, released a statement Friday
praising the court’s decision.</p>
<p>“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached
the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist
Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat
that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,”
Krishnamoorthi said.</p>
<p>“Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s
control is a day that our security is at risk,” Krishnamoorthi
added.</p>
<p>Representative John Moolenaar, the committee’s Republican chairman,
said in a statement that the ruling was “a victory for the American
people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party,
which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance’s control over TikTok
to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens and threaten our
national security.”</p>
<p>Moolenaar also held out hope to the app’s users that access to it
may, in the end, be preserved under a Trump presidency.</p>
<p>“I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American
takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I
look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,”
Moolenaar said.</p>

id="former-police-officer-denies-leaking-information-to-proud-boys-leader">Former
police officer denies leaking information to Proud Boys leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A retired Washington, D.C., police officer charged with
lying about his private communications with former Proud Boys national
leader Enrique Tarrio testified Friday that he never leaked sensitive
police information to the far-right extremist group leader. </p>
<p>Taking the witness stand at his federal trial, former Metropolitan
Police Department Lieutenant Shane Lamond said he was upset that a
prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys “sympathizer” who acted as a
“double agent” for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives
Matter banner in December 2020. </p>
<p>“I don’t support the Proud Boys, and I’m not a Proud Boys
sympathizer,” said Lamond, whose bench trial started Monday and
continues next week. </p>
<p>Tarrio, who testified Thursday as a witness for Lamond’s defense, is
serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in a plot to use force to
keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election. Tarrio
previously was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning
the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington
and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the
district. </p>
<p>Lamond said Tarrio never confessed to him that he burned the banner.
He also denies tipping off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been
signed before he arrived in Washington on January 4, 2021 — two days
before other Proud Boys joined a mob’s attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>
<p>Lamond’s indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the
January 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger
of being charged in the attack. </p>
<p>“Of course I can’t say it officially, but personally I support you
all and don’t want to see your group’s name and reputation dragged
through the mud,” Lamond wrote. </p>
<p>Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he
said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain
his trust. </p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to other
messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with “real-time updates” on
the police investigation of the December 12, 2020, banner burning. </p>
<p>Lamond is charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three
counts of making false statements. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman
Jackson will decide the case after hearing testimony without a
jury. </p>
<p>Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence
branch of the police department’s Homeland Security Bureau. He was
responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to
Washington. </p>
<p>The men exchanged hundreds of messages across several platforms, with
Lamond frequently greeting Tarrio as “brother.” However, Lamond
acknowledged that he only sent encrypted messages to Tarrio or met him
in person after the banner burning.  </p>
<p>On the day of his arrest, Tarrio posted a message to other Proud Boys
leaders that said, “The warrant was just signed.” Tarrio testified
Thursday that he didn’t confess to Lamond or receive any confidential
information from him. </p>
<p>After the banner burning but before Tarrio’s arrest, Lamond told him
that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service was “all spun up” by chatter that
Proud Boys planned to dress up as supporters of President Joe Biden for
the Democrat’s inauguration in January 2021. </p>
<p>“I’m just going to let them get all freaked out. They’re idiots,”
Lamond wrote of his federal colleagues. </p>
<p>“Lol,” Tarrio responded. </p>
<p>Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, retired in May 2023 after 23
years of service to the police department.</p>

id="us-state-seeks-47.8m-fine-for-air-pollution-by-natural-gas-processor">US
state seeks $47.8M fine for air pollution by natural gas processor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — New Mexico environmental regulators issued a
$47.8 million fine Friday on allegations of excess air pollution at a
natural gas processing facility in a prolific oil production region near
the Texas state line.</p>
<p>The state Environment Department issued the sanctions including a
cease-and-desist order against Houston-based Targa Resources at its
processing plant near Jal, New Mexico, alleging permit violations and
excess emissions of gases known to cause respiratory issues or
contribute to climate change including ozone-producing pollutants.</p>
<p>Representatives for Targa could not immediately be reached for
comment. Regulators say Targa has 30 days to respond and comply or
request a hearing with the agency secretary.</p>
<p>Regulators also have ordered a series of corrective actions and
improvements to the facilities that process gas for transmission by
pipeline.</p>
<p>The sanctions are based on allegations of two permit violations, late
reporting of emissions and an incomplete requirement for a root cause
analysis of excess pollution.</p>
<p>The proposed air-pollution fine against Targa would be the largest in
state history by the Environment Department, if upheld. The case also
was referred to federal regulators.</p>
<p>Separately, the New Mexico Court of Appeals last month upheld
regulations aimed at crushing air pollution in one of the nation’s
top-producing oil and gas states.</p>
<p>Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration has
advanced new restrictions on ozone-precursor pollutants along with

<h2 id="austin-tice-is-alive-family-of-american-journalist-says">Austin
Tice is alive, family of American journalist says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — American journalist Austin Tice is still alive, more
than 12 years after he was detained in Syria, his mother, Debra Tice,
said Friday, citing a source vetted by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>“Austin is alive and being treated well, and I can tell you he is
waiting to come home,” Debra Tice told VOA. “We have a very reliable
source that is totally verified.”</p>
<p>A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Austin Tice is an
award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for
outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy.</p>
<p>Austin Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus in August 2012.
Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been seen or
heard of him since.</p>
<p>“He is so ready. And he has known from the very first day that he was
detained that he was going to walk free again,” Debra Tice told VOA.
“And so, we want to see him on the tarmac. We want to see that
happen.”</p>
<p>Austin Tice’s father, Mark, characterized the source as
“unimpeachable” but said the family could not share more details because
the intelligence was classified.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to VOA’s request
for comment.</p>
<p>The revelation comes as the Tice family met with White House
officials on Friday to push for the U.S. government to do more to secure
Austin Tice’s release. The meeting occurred amid renewed clashes in
Syria, as insurgent fighters who have already captured the northern city
of Aleppo, one of the country’s largest, are pressing their march
against President Bashar Assad’s forces.</p>
<p>At a press conference following the White House meeting, the Tice
family criticized Biden administration officials for not providing any
updates during their meeting.</p>
<p>Debra Tice told VOA she hopes President Joe Biden uses his final
weeks in the White House to do everything he can to secure her son’s
release.</p>
<p>The family’s update comes the same week that President-elect Donald
Trump announced that he would select Adam Boehler to serve as special
presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The former chief executive
officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation,
Boehler was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords.</p>

prisoner swap reunites Uyghur families as work continues to secure
others’ freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Lost in much of the debate over “hostage diplomacy”
after last week’s rare prisoner swap between the U.S. and China is that
in addition to the three Americans, three Uyghurs were on the flight
from China. The exchange highlights Beijing’s persecution of ethnic
minorities prompting renewed international scrutiny.</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to VOA that the three
Uyghurs were on the flight but declined to provide additional details
“out of respect for their privacy.”</p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration has continuously advocated for cases
of humanitarian concern, including Uyghurs,” the spokesperson told VOA.
“We are pleased that these [Uyghur] individuals are home with their
families.”</p>
<p>Among those freed was 73-year-old Ayshem Mamut, the mother of
prominent Uyghur rights advocate and Uyghur American lawyer Nury
Turkel.</p>
<p>According to Turkel, the last time he saw his mother was 20 years
ago, when she traveled to Washington for his graduation from American
University.</p>
<p>“Her last trip to the U.S. was in the summer of 2004, when she came
to D.C. with my late father for my law school graduation,” Turkel told
VOA.</p>
<p>Turkel’s parents stayed in the U.S. for about five months before
returning to China. Since then, his mother had been barred from leaving
the country.</p>
<p>“The Chinese authorities never specifically said why my parents
couldn’t leave the country,” Turkel said. “However, I believe a travel
ban was imposed on my parents because of my decadeslong advocacy work
and my U.S. government service from 2020 to 2024.”</p>
<p>Turkel served as a commissioner and chair of the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom from 2020 to 2024. In response to his
advocacy for religious freedom for oppressed communities, he was
sanctioned by China in 2021 and Russia in 2022.</p>
<p>Turkel described the reunion with his mother as a profoundly
emotional moment, crediting years of persistent advocacy by individuals
and institutions across multiple U.S. administrations.</p>
<p>“This reunion is a testament to the U.S. government’s steadfast
commitment to human rights and justice for the Uyghur people,” Turkel
said. “I am so proud of our country and leadership at the highest level
— President [Joe] Biden, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,
Secretary [Antony] Blinken and countless national security professionals
invested so much time and energy over the years.”</p>
<p>He added that the reunion has been transformative for his mother.</p>
<p>“For my mother, this moment represents a rebirth of joy and
humanity,” Turkel said.</p>
<p>“After decades apart, she can finally experience the love and
laughter of her grandchildren — a connection that transcends the pain of
separation and reminds us of the enduring power of family. She is
profoundly grateful to those who made this reunion possible, especially
Ambassador Nick Burns, whose compassionate actions reflect the best of
humanity.”</p>
<p>Advocates push for continued U.S. action</p>
<p>Rayhan Asat, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and a Uyghur lawyer
whose brother, Ekpar Asat, remains imprisoned in China, welcomed the
release but called for continued efforts to secure freedom for other
Uyghurs.</p>
<p>“I urge President Biden to secure Ekpar’s release and bring him home
during the remainder of his presidency. His continued imprisonment sends
a chilling message that participating in U.S. programs comes with grave
risk,” Asat told VOA.</p>
<p>Ekpar Asat was sentenced to 15 years in prison after participating in
a U.S.-China cultural exchange program organized by the State
Department.</p>
<p>“As the ambassador emphasized today, the state of U.S.-China
relations hinges on the choices China makes, including its support for
unjust wars. One of those choices must be to end the ongoing genocide
against the Uyghur people,” Asat added.</p>
<p>Ferkat Jawdat, another Uyghur American advocate, expressed mixed
emotions about the release. Jawdat has lobbied U.S. administrations to
secure the freedom of his mother, whom he has not seen since 2006. She
has been barred from leaving China for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>“While I’m very happy for <span class="citation"
data-cites="nuryturkel">@nuryturkel</span> and his family’s reunion with
their mother, I’m very sad that my mom was excluded from this,” he
wrote. “I’ve been asking the U.S. government for years for the same when
I met with former Secretary of State <span class="citation"
data-cites="mikepompeo">@mikepompeo</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="SecBlinken">@SecBlinken</span>,” Jawdat said in a tweet on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>Turkel offered a message of hope and resilience to the global Uyghur
community, encouraging them to remain steadfast in their advocacy.</p>
<p>“To my Uyghur communities around the world, I urge you to hold onto
hope and faith,” Turkel said. “My family’s reunion is a living testament
to the possibility of change, even in the face of immense challenges.
Share your stories, advocate for your loved ones and know that your
voices matter.”</p>
<p>He emphasized that international attention and tireless efforts are
making a difference.</p>
<p>“The world is listening, and there are people tirelessly working for
justice and reconnecting families like ours,” he said. “Together, our
resilience and solidarity can pave the way for others to experience
similar moments of joy and relief.”</p>

id="lobito-corridor-takes-center-stage-angolans-pin-hopes-on-bidens-visit">Lobito
Corridor takes center stage; Angolans pin hopes on Biden’s visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s visit to Angola highlighted the potential
of the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer, multinational railway project
intended to connect markets and jumpstart trade.</p>
<p>The presidential visit raised hopes but also drew skepticism from
some Angolans who spoke to VOA about their daily struggles and the need
for economic development.</p>
<p>In Luanda, the capital, Angolans told VOA why they are anxious for
the benefits they think will come from the investment.</p>
<p>“We are suffering a lot. We’re struggling,” said Albertina Manuel, a
street vendor, who expressed frustration over rising living costs.
“School is very expensive; we are not able to pay our children’s
tuition. It’s harder now. We never suffered like this before,” she told
VOA’s Portuguese Service.</p>
<p>Sacamauro Eduardo, a university student, hoped for a meaningful
U.S.-Africa relationship.</p>
<p>“I hope to see a strengthened relationship with Africa, and in
particular between Angola and the U.S.,” he said. “I hope they approach
the most important issues for the people, like poverty and investment in
education. We don’t want them to just talk. They need to bring good
benefits to the Angolan people.”</p>
<p>Others, like Amelia Joao, another market seller, said they hope the
investment can bring down the cost of staple food products.</p>
<p>“Lower our prices,” and “help us produce things,” she said. “With
more production in the country, the prices will lower.”</p>
<p>Solia Selende, another Luanda resident, said the United States should
look beyond the polished image often presented to foreign leaders. “If
they go deeper into the slums, what they will see will make them very
sad,” he said. “There are people starving to death, not only in Luanda
but in all Angolan provinces.”</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor project is at the center of Angola’s aspirations
for economic renewal.</p>
<p>Stretching from the Atlantic port of Lobito through the country’s
central highlands and into the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of
Congo, it could reshape regional trade dynamics, facilitating export of
copper, cobalt, and other critical minerals from the DRC and Zambia to
global markets.</p>
<p>Initially established during Angola’s colonial era, the rail
infrastructure suffered years of neglect because of decades of civil
war. However, with a $5 billion investment backed by partners including
U.S. and European companies, the Lobito Corridor is being
refurbished.</p>
<p>Anthony Carroll, senior study group member on critical minerals at
the United States Institute of Peace, pointed to its geopolitical and
economic significance.</p>
<p>“The Lobito Corridor is a bold effort to refurbish and construct a
rail line,” he said.</p>
<p>“It will speed access to critical minerals for European and U.S.
markets, which have been largely dominated by China in the last 20
years,” he said. “It will also give more value to Africans in terms of
the return they’ll enjoy for enhanced infrastructure investment and
development.”</p>
<p>Carroll also cited potential problems, including fluctuating global
demand for critical minerals and competition from other infrastructure
projects, such as the Chinese-funded refurbishment of the
Tanzania-Zambia Railway, known as TAZARA, which would carry those
minerals to the Indian Ocean for shipping to Asia.</p>
<p>Angola’s leadership, however, said the projects can complement each
other and there should not be a rivalry. Foreign Minister Tete Antonio
emphasized the potential of linking the Lobito Corridor to TAZARA.</p>
<p>“Our ambition is to connect the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic,” he
told VOA. “This is not about competition; in Africa, we see this as an
opportunity for collaboration.”</p>
<p>Beyond minerals, the corridor could improve sectors such as
agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing. Antonio mentioned discussions
on expanding agricultural production for export through the railway
route.</p>
<p>Economic integration</p>
<p>The corridor is a centerpiece of the Biden administration’s focus on
infrastructure development in Africa under the Partnership for Global
Infrastructure and Investment, a G7 initiative to counter China’s Belt
and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs, told VOA’s
English to Africa Service the U.S. is committed to ensuring the project
benefits the region.</p>
<p>“The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it’s about infrastructure,
but it’s also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly,”
she said.</p>
<p>“It’s all about sustainable economic development; it’s all about a
transparent contracting process. It’s about ensuring that it boosts
regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives.”</p>
<p>For Angola, the corridor could support exports to the United States
through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows duty-free
access to the U.S. market for certain goods produced in African
countries.</p>
<p>Anderson Jeronimo, director of planning at Angola’s Agriculture
Ministry, described the corridor as a way to improve Angola’s
agricultural exports.</p>
<p>“Opportunities like AGOA can help us export more coffee and fruit
products to the U.S.,” he said. “We need U.S. support to better
understand and take full advantage of AGOA.”</p>
<p>Hopes and challenges</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of projects such as the Lobito
Corridor, many Angolans face issues such as rising food prices,
unaffordable education, and inadequate health care.</p>
<p>The country’s economy has been hit hard by fluctuating oil prices and
its government has struggled to repay more than $17 billion in debt to
China.</p>
<p>Luanda resident Rosalina Cativa said she sees the corridor as a
lifeline for the struggling economy.</p>
<p>“Our country is in really bad shape,” she said. “A lot of things have
to change, especially regarding food prices and education. We look at
our country’s health, and it’s really, really bad. We need help.”</p>
<p>VOA Portuguese Service’s Coque Mukuta and Mayra Fernandes contributed
to the report from Luanda, Angola. VOA English to Africa’s Peter Clottey
and Philip Alexiou contributed from Washington.</p>

Ukrainian President Poroshenko: We can stop the war in 24 hours</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, now leader
of the opposition European Solidarity Party, sat down with Voice of
America during a visit to Washington to attend the annual forum of the
International Democracy Union, an alliance of center-right political
parties.</p>
<p>While in the U.S. capital, Poroshenko met with Biden administration
officials and members of the incoming Trump administration to share his
assessment of the situation Ukraine is facing more than two and a half
years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, and his vision of
how to end the conflict.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: How would you describe the situation on the front lines in
Ukraine?</p>
<p>Petro Poroshenko, former Ukrainian president: Every week, I travel to
the front lines to deliver needed equipment and armaments. Russia is
increasing its pressure. Russia has more sophisticated weapons than even
half a year [ago]. Ukrainian soldiers are tired because some have served
for over two and a half years, but they still wouldn’t allow Russians to
break through the Ukrainian positions.</p>
<p>At the moment, we shouldn’t think about offensive operations but
[how] to strengthen fortifications. I appreciate the decision of the
United States government to give us anti-infantry mines. Having three,
four, five kilometers of a minefield is an excellent response to the new
tactics of Russia, which is penetrating Ukrainian positions with small
groups of five to 12 persons with the support of Russian artillery,
which has an unlimited number of artillery shells.</p>
<p>If we have fortifications, minefields and reconnaissance drones,
including thermal night drones and [an] unlimited number of FPV drones
to destroy these small groups, [an] effective radio-electronic warfare
system, including against Russian reconnaissance drones, I’m confident
we can keep [the] defense lines.</p>
<p>VOA: Ukraine is under pressure to start negotiating. Is this a good
time for that?</p>
<p>Poroshenko: No other nation in the world wants peace more than
Ukrainians because we pay an enormous price. However, the negotiations
should start when both sides are ready. Everybody asks if Ukraine is
ready, and nobody asks if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is ready
for these negotiations. Putin is not ready. We should undertake enormous
efforts to prepare Putin for these negotiations. What language should we
speak to Putin? The language of strength, including sophisticated and
modern weapons for Ukraine. Putin should feel that he is paying a high
price. We need stronger sanctions to destroy the shadow fleet. The
sanctions should lower Russian exports from $600 [billion] to $200
billion to cut Putin’s ability to finance the war.</p>
<p>VOA: Do you think the new Trump administration will support your
vision?</p>
<p>Poroshenko: I strongly believe in the global leadership of the United
States. I worked with [President Donald] Trump in 2016-2019. Meeting him
was one of my first meetings as president of Ukraine. Our meeting was
scheduled for five minutes — just to shake hands and take a photo — and
lasted for two and a half hours. As a result, he gave Ukraine the first
lethal weapons after three years of the war, the legendary Javelins
[anti-tank missiles]. They saved lots of lives in the Donbas region.
Even without additional consultation with our European partners, we
agreed that the United States introduce sanctions against the company
contractor for the North Stream 2 [natural gas pipeline], which was
vital. In President Trump’s presence we discussed with [his former CIA
Director Mike] Pompeo the coordination of efforts to recognize the
Ukrainian independent church. Trump is a person of results, not process.
He is decisive enough to make tough decisions.</p>
<p>VOA: Trump nominated General Keith Kellogg as the U.S. special
representative for Ukraine and Russia. What do you think about him and
his ideas?</p>
<p>Poroshenko: I’ve met him several times when he was a member of [then]
Vice President [Mike] Pence’s team. I welcome President Trump’s approach
to appoint a special presidential envoy to Ukraine. When President Trump
appointed Kurt Volker [as U.S. special representative for Ukraine
negotiations], that was extremely efficient. And now, General Kellogg’s
level of professionalism gives us careful optimism.</p>
<p>We can stop the war in 24 hours, as President Trump promised, and
without a single shot [fired] or a dollar spent. We need just one
signature for one treaty — the Washington Treaty [the April 1949 treaty
establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance]. Inviting Ukraine to
join NATO will be a powerful demonstration to Putin that we are not
afraid of his blackmail. We are decisive enough, and we want to have
sustainable security on the continent.</p>
<p>I propose my plan — the “Poroshenko Plan.” Within one year, partners
guarantee that Ukraine will get a full [NATO] membership if it meets
specific criteria and fulfills certain conditions. During that year,
while we are not in NATO, we will receive the same security guarantees
as Finland and Sweden before their full NATO membership. During that
year, I also suggest having peacekeepers under the mandate of the United
Nations Security Council to guarantee a ceasefire. That’s how to stop
the war in 24 hours.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The world has been very hot lately. Like, <em><em>really</em></em> hot.
Much hotter than you might expect from climate change alone.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, the global average temperature was
<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
1.5 degrees Celsius</u></a>, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above its
pre-industrial level. It is
<a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
certain</u></a> to exceed that milestone in 2024.
</p>
<p>
These are extreme leaps. For context, 2019 was the second-hottest year
on record when it happened, and it was
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/201913#:~:text=registros%20en%201880-,Global%20Temperatures,C%20(%2B1.71%C2%B0F)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>merely
0.95 degrees Celsius</u></a> above the pre-industrial average. So
Earth’s temperature has seemingly surged half a degree Celsius in five
years.
</p>
<p>
These searingly hot temperatures aren’t completely outside the range
climate models predict, but they are arriving sooner than most
scientists thought, and climate researchers
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/climate-change-heat-planet.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
yet reached a consensus</u></a> explanation for why they are happening.
</p>
<p>
This week, though, we got somewhat closer. A new study adds to a growing
literature suggesting that a change to global shipping fuels has
accidentally contributed to a surge in warming.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, the International Maritime Organization began enforcing rules
that removed a toxic air pollutant, sulfur dioxide, from shipping fuels.
Sulfur dioxide can inflame and irritate the heart and lungs, trigger
asthma attacks, and can cause acid rain. But it can also reflect heat
back into space, cooling the Earth.
</p>
<p>
These cooling effects of sulfur dioxide are very short-lived, and sulfur
dioxide only sticks around in the atmosphere for
<a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp116-c5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
a week and a half</u></a>. (Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can
persist in the atmosphere for a millennium.)
</p>
<p>
It now seems that all those sulfur aerosols were likely reflecting
enough heat back into space to make a noticeable difference in the
Earth’s temperature rise. The new study, written by the researchers
Ilaria Quaglia and Daniele Visioni, finds that removing sulfur dioxide
from shipping fuel likely increased the planet’s temperature by 0.08
degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
This change alone can’t explain the Earth’s recent surge in temperature
rise. But the new rules likely made the record-breaking temperatures in
2023 roughly 12 times likelier than they would have been had the rules
not changed, Visioni, an atmospheric chemistry professor at Cornell,
told me.
</p>
<p>
“The likelihood of something like 2023 happening — was it made larger,
was it made bigger, by this contribution? We found, yes,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The timing of the surge — and the fact that the most anomalously warm
part of the planet has been the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean, a
popular shipping route — also support the conclusion that the IMO rules
are playing an effect.
</p>
<p>
Other factors — including natural fluctuations in Earth’s multi-year
climate cycles, like El Niño — may have helped the surge along too,
Visioni said. “If you take a probabilistic approach, you can say, even
without the shipping rules, 2023 wouldn’t have been completely
impossible,” he added. “But you cannot evaluate the truthfulness of
probability from one outcome because you only have one world.” In other
words, both climate change and our response to it are part of the same
poorly designed experiment — and we can only run that experiment once.
</p>
<p>
Over the past 12 months, several other papers have reached a similar
conclusion, although they disagree about the magnitude of the IMO’s
accidental cooling effect. Quaglia and Visioni’s study finds one of the
largest effects.
</p>
<p>
The literature suggests that sulfur dioxide’s effects are “in the range
of 300ths to 800ths of a degree Celsius, but I don’t know that we can
say that we’re on the high or low end of that,” Zeke Hausfather, a
climate scientist who studies carbon removal technologies at the tech
company Stripe, told me. Hausfather
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
his own estimate</u></a> of how much shipping rules have affected the
recent warming episode — about five hundredths of a degree Celsius —
which he reached with Piers Forster, a climate physics professor at the
University of Leeds.
</p>
<p>
The exact magnitude of the effect, though, might matter less than the
fact that it happened at all. For Visioni, the results demonstrate that
policymakers need to think more intentionally about the tradeoffs
between cutting toxic air pollution emissions and losing the cooling
effect those same toxic emissions produce.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few decades, humanity has gotten better at cutting toxic
air pollution from power plants and industrial activities than previous
climate models estimated. That means that, somewhat paradoxically, it
might be more difficult to stay below the Paris Agreement’s 2 degrees C
warming goal because the same levels of greenhouse gas emissions will
now have a greater warming effect than they would have in 2015.
</p>
<p>
It’s time to
<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/em/c3em00178d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>discuss
this trade-off</u></a> frankly and head-on, he told me. That also means
taking seriously — and beginning research — on the proposition that
humanity may want to experiment with intentionally releasing some forms
of aerosols to suppress the planet’s warming — something the
international shipping community has historically been loath to do.
</p>
<p>
In 2013, a paper from Finnish researchers
<a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/12059/2013/acp-13-12059-2013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a>
that ships could retain the climate benefits of sulfur aerosol pollution
— while mitigating most of their public health downsides — by burning
clean fuels near the coasts, but dirtier fuel on the open ocean. Under
that scenario, shipping emissions would actually have reflected even
more heat than they did at the time. But the group downplayed that
scenario in part because it was a potential form of geoengineering.
</p>
<p>
Is it? It’s not clear where the line of “intentionality” in
geoengineering lies, Visioni said. If you stop doing something bad for
the environment, but it has a warming effect on the climate, are you
geoengineering? Or are you passing prudent environmental policy? The
question of where geoengineering begins or ends gets harder and harder
to adjudicate — especially while humanity conducts what is in essence
<em><em>the largest and most important</em></em> <em><em>geo-engineering
experiment possible </em></em>by burning fossil fuels and releasing
billions of tons of greenhouse gas pollution into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Visioni made a point to emphasize that he’s in favor of the IMO’s
efforts to clean up shipping emissions. “Do we keep polluting? No. I
think we should be forceful and say no,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“But on the other hand, my wish would be if we started discussions a bit
more like, ’Okay, so do we think that these [warming] thresholds are so
important? And if so, are we willing to have a discussion about what we
could do to prevent this warming from happening?”
</p>
<p>
Visioni’s paper is not the only new study that seeks to explain the
warming blip. On Friday, a team of German researchers wrote in
<em><em>Science </em></em>that
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--o9r8bM1weCrsevliYOiyF8dJuM3Agx61e6UBx02I0mkDchU8zUN9HBsZp3XiWEiizJAU4hVIrGax0RpInLJhyr60Aeg&_hsmi=337363203&utm_content=337363203&utm_source=hs_email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
recent and mysterious decline in low-altitude clouds</u></a> in the
atmosphere has decreased the planet’s brightness. Clouds, like sulfur
aerosol emissions, reflect heat back into space, and so their decline
would also contribute to a warming surge.
</p>
<p>
They provide another piece of evidence that the surge in warming is
caused by some fundamental change to the climate system and not by a
multiu-seasonal hiccup like El Niño. “The big question that we have is:
Is this a blip or not?” Hausfather said. “If we’re in the world where El
Nino is behaving weirdly, that’s kind of the comforting one, because it
means we’ll go back to normal — <em><em>normal</em></em> here being a
rapidly warming world. If the spike in warming over the past two years
is due to natural variability, it means it will likely be shortlived.”
</p>
<p>
The more worrying possibility, he continued, is that something more
fundamental has changed in the climate system. Climate scientists
describe these shifts as a change in “radiative forcings,” meaning a
change in the basic dynamics that force adjustments in the energy
balance between the Earth, the Sun, and outer space.
</p>
<p>
“If this is a change in forcings — which clouds or aerosols would imply
— then that change in forcing would likely persist. It would be a factor
that continues affecting the climate in the future, rather than just a
blip,” Hausfather said.

id="poll-most-americans-want-us-leadership-on-global-affairs-increased-defense-spending">Poll:
Most Americans want US leadership on global affairs, increased defense
spending</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON  — A majority of Americans want the United States to lead on
the global stage with a strong military, and a supermajority want to
increase national defense spending, according to the latest Reagan
National Defense Survey.</p>
<p>Despite Americans electing a president who ran on an “America First”
agenda that focused on domestic issues ranging from the U.S. economy to
securing the southern U.S. border, 57% of those surveyed said they
wanted to see the U.S. more engaged and taking the lead on international
events this year, compared with 42% a year ago.</p>
<p>Nearly 80% of Americans surveyed supported increased government
spending on the U.S. military, a slight increase from last year.
Increasing military spending ranked high above some of the other U.S.
foreign policy priorities, such as promoting freedom abroad (61%) and
providing foreign aid (43%).</p>
<p>“The Reagan National Defense Survey demonstrates yet again that
Americans are not pacifists, and we are not isolationists. We want a
federal government that serves American interests and protects our
country,” Bradley Bowman, a member of the survey’s advisory board and
the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power for
the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA Friday.</p>
<p>The Ronald Reagan Institute has surveyed U.S. public opinion on
national security for the past six years, and the latest poll, released
Thursday, included a bipartisan sample of about 2,500 Americans who were
surveyed two days after the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Most respondents said they supported continued U.S. security support
for Ukraine and allowing Ukraine to fire U.S. weapons inside Russia,
with nearly 60% believing the Russia-Ukraine conflict will end with
Ukraine negotiating for peace, even if that means giving up some of its
sovereign territory.</p>
<p>Ukraine support differed widely among voters for the Democratic
presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republican
candidate, President-elect Donald Trump, with 74% of Harris voters in
support of sending aid compared with 42% of Trump voters.</p>
<p>A supermajority (80%) sees Russia as an adversary.</p>
<p>On Israel, 54% of those surveyed supported continuing U.S. aid, but
Americans were split 45% to 45% on whether Israel has a right to
continue military action or Israel’s military action in Gaza has gone on
long enough and needs to transition to a ceasefire.</p>
<p>About half of those surveyed think the United States would prevail in
a conflict with China, with nearly the same number finding China to be
the greatest threat to the United States.</p>
<p>If China invaded Taiwan, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said
the U.S. should officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation,
with two-thirds agreeing that the U.S. should respond with economic
sanctions against China and more than half supporting sending more
military equipment to Taiwan (56%) and moving more military assets such
as aircraft carriers into the region (58%).</p>
<p>Most Americans surveyed believe the U.S. military should be large
enough to win two simultaneous wars.</p>

id="trump-taps-forceful-ally-of-hardline-immigration-policies-to-head-customs-and-border-protection">Trump
taps forceful ally of hardline immigration policies to head Customs and
Border Protection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The picture of who will be in charge of executing
President-elect Donald Trump’s hardline immigration and border policies
has come into sharper focus after he announced his picks to head Customs
and Border Protection and also the agency tasked with deporting
immigrants in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Trump said late Thursday he was tapping Rodney Scott, a former Border
Patrol chief who has been a vocal supporter of tougher enforcement
measures, for CBP commissioner.</p>
<p>As acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Trump said
he’d nominate Caleb Vitello, a career ICE official with more than 23
years in the agency who most recently has been the assistant director
for firearms and tactical programs.</p>
<p>They will work with an immigration leadership team that includes
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as head of the Homeland Security
Department; former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement head Tom
Homan as border czar; and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller as
deputy chief of staff.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection, with its roughly 60,000 employees,
falls under the Homeland Security Department. It includes the Border
Patrol, which Scott led during Trump’s first term, and he essentially is
responsible for protecting the country’s borders while facilitating
trade and travel.</p>
<p>Scott comes to the job firmly from the Border Patrol side of the
house. He became an agent in 1992 and spent much of his career in San
Diego. When he joined the agency, San Diego was by far the busiest
corridor for illegal crossings. Traffic plummeted after the government
dramatically increased enforcement there, but critics note the effort
pushed people to remote parts of California and Arizona.</p>
<p>San Diego was also where wall construction began in the 1990s, which
shaped Scott’s belief that barriers work. He was named San Diego sector
chief in 2017.</p>
<p>When he was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020, he
enthusiastically embraced Trump’s policies.</p>
<p>“He’s well known. He does know these issues and obviously is trusted
by the administration,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the CBP commissioner under
the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Kerlikowske took issue with some of Scott’s past actions, including
his refusal to fall in line with a Biden administration directive to
stop using terms like “illegal alien” in favor of descriptions like
“migrant,” and his decision as San Diego sector chief to fire tear gas
into Mexico to disperse protesters.</p>
<p>“You don’t launch projectiles into a foreign country,” Kerlikowske
said.</p>
<p>At the time Scott defended the agents’ decisions, saying they were
being assaulted by “a hail of rocks.”</p>
<p>While much of the focus of Trump’s administration may be on illegal
immigration and security along the U.S.-Mexico border, Kerlikowske also
stressed the importance of other parts of Customs and Border
Protection’s mission.</p>
<p>The agency is responsible for securing trade and international travel
at airports, ports and land crossings around the country. Whoever runs
the agency has to make sure that billions of dollars’ worth of trade and
millions of passengers move swiftly and safely into and out of the
country.</p>
<p>And if Trump makes good on promises to ratchet up tariffs on Mexico,
China and Canada, CBP will play an integral role in enforcing them.</p>
<p>“There’s a huge amount of other responsibility on trade, on tourism,
on cyber that take a significant amount of time and have a huge impact
on the economy if it’s not done right,” Kerlikowske said.</p>
<p>After being forced out under the Biden administration, Scott has been
a vocal supporter of Trump’s hardline immigration agenda. He has
appeared frequently on Fox News and testified in Congress. He’s also a
senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.</p>
<p>In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, he advocated for a
return to Trump-era immigration policies and more pressure on Mexico to
enforce immigration on its side of the border.</p>

id="trump-offers-public-show-of-support-for-hegseth-his-embattled-choice-to-lead-pentagon">Trump
offers public show of support for Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead
Pentagon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday offered a
public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead
the Defense Department, whose confirmation by the Senate is in doubt as
he faces questions over allegations of excessive drinking, sexual
assault and his views on women in combat.</p>
<p>“Pete Hegseth is doing very well,” Trump posted on his social media
site. “He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense.” The
president added that “Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be
done to change that!!!”</p>
<p>Hegseth, a former Fox News host, Army National Guard major and combat
veteran, spent much of the week on Capitol Hill trying to salvage his
Cabinet nomination and reassure Republican senators that he is fit to
lead Trump’s Pentagon.</p>
<p>The effort has quickly become a test of Trump’s clout and of how far
loyalty for the president-elect goes with Republican senators who have
concerns about his nominees. Trump has already met some resistance. Two
of his other choices have stepped aside as they faced intense scrutiny:
former Congressman Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general;
and Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff who was Trump’s first choice to
lead the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Vice President-elect JD Vance also made a show of support for Hegseth
on Friday, part of a full-court press by members of Trump’s Make America
Great Again movement.</p>
<p>“If you’re a GOP Senator who voted for Lloyd Austin, but criticize
<span class="citation" data-cites="PeteHegseth">@PeteHegseth</span>,
then maybe you’re in the wrong political party!” Vance wrote on X.</p>
<p>Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job and told lawmakers he
never engaged in sexual misconduct, even as his professional views on
female troops have also come under intensifying scrutiny. He said as
recently as last month that women “straight up” should not serve in
combat.</p>
<p>Two female senators, Republican Joni Ernst of Iowa and Democrat Tammy
Duckworth of Illinois, sit on the Armed Services Committee. Both are
combat veterans who served in the Iraq war, and Duckworth lost both legs
when a Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting was hit by a
rocket-propelled grenade.</p>
<p>Ernst, who is also a sexual assault survivor, stopped short of an
endorsement after her meeting with Hegseth this week. She said she
appreciates his military service and they “had a frank and thorough
conversation.”</p>
<p>Hegseth has yet to meet with Duckworth.</p>
<p>Trump’s transition team has been looking at potential replacements if
Hegseth’s nomination cannot move forward, including former Trump rival
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>DeSantis plans to attend the Army-Navy football game with Trump on
December 14, according to a person familiar with the Florida governor’s
plans who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to
discuss them before a public announcement.</p>
<p>DeSantis and Trump spoke about the defense secretary post when they
saw each other Tuesday at a memorial service for sheriff’s deputies in
West Palm Beach, Florida, according to people familiar with the matter
who said Trump was interested in DeSantis for the post, and the governor
was receptive.</p>
<p>DeSantis also is poised to select a replacement for the expected
Senate vacancy to be created by Marco Rubio becoming secretary of state,
and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump is seen as the preferred choice
by those in Trump’s orbit.</p>
<p>Hegseth is facing resistance from lawmakers as reports have emerged
about his past, including the revelation that he made a settlement
payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies.</p>
<p>The New Yorker magazine cited what it described as a whistleblower
report and other documents about his time leading a veterans advocacy
group, Concerned Veterans for America, that alleged multiple incidents
of alcohol intoxication at work events, inappropriate behavior around
female staffers and financial mismanagement.</p>
<p>The New York Times obtained an email from his mother, Penelope, from
2018, in which she confronted him about mistreating women after he
impregnated his current wife while he was married to his second wife.
She went on “Fox &amp; Friends” this week to defend her son.</p>

id="federal-appeals-court-upholds-law-requiring-sale-or-ban-of-tiktok-in-us">Federal
appeals court upholds law requiring sale or ban of TikTok in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal appeals court panel on Friday upheld a law that could lead
to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to
the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the
U.S. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled
that the law, which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based
parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January, is constitutional,
rebuffing TikTok’s challenge that the statute ran afoul of the First
Amendment and unfairly targeted the platform. </p>
<p>“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United
States,” said the court’s opinion. “Here the Government acted solely to
protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that
adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.” </p>
<p>TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are
expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, President-elect
Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term and whose
Justice Department would have to enforce the law, said during the
presidential campaign that he is now against a TikTok ban and would work
to “save” the social media platform. </p>
<p>The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, culminated a
years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app,
which the government sees as a national security threat because of its
connections to China. </p>
<p>The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths
of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that
could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion.
Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what
users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese
authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way
that’s difficult to detect. </p>
<p>However, a significant portion of the government’s information in the
case has been redacted and hidden from the public as well as the two
companies. </p>
<p>TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long
denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans.
Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn’t provided
evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese
government, or manipulated content for Beijing’s benefit in the
U.S. </p>
<p>They also have argued the law is predicated on future risks, which
the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified
action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands
from the Chinese government. </p>
<p>Friday’s ruling came after the appeals court panel heard oral
arguments in September. </p>
<p>Some legal experts said at the time that it was challenging to read
the tea leaves on how the judges would rule. </p>
<p>In a court hearing that lasted more than two hours, the panel —
composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges — appeared
to grapple with how TikTok’s foreign ownership affects its rights under
the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail
potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. </p>
<p>The judges pressed Daniel Tenny, a Justice Department attorney, on
the implications the case could have on the First Amendment. But they
also expressed some skepticism at TikTok’s arguments, challenging the
company’s attorney — Andrew Pincus —on whether any First Amendment
rights preclude the government from curtailing a powerful company
subject to the laws and influence of a foreign adversary. </p>
<p>In parts of their questions about TikTok’s ownership, the judges
cited wartime precedent that allows the U.S. to restrict foreign
ownership of broadcast licenses and asked if the arguments presented by
TikTok would apply if the U.S. was engaged in war. </p>
<p>To assuage concerns about the company’s owners, TikTok says it has
invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user
data. </p>
<p>The company also argues the government’s broader concerns could have
been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration
more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has
blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the
agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. </p>
<p>Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it’s impossible to
divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any
sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm — the platform’s secret
sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture
plan — would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected
from other global content. </p>
<p>Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in
purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were
launching a consortium to purchase TikTok’s U.S. business. </p>
<p>This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative,
which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their
bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in
capital. </p>
<p>TikTok’s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge
brought by several content creators — for which the company is covering
legal costs — as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative
creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. </p>
<p>If TikTok appeals and the courts continue to uphold the law, it would
fall on Trump’s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any
potential violations with fines. The penalties would apply to app stores
that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting
services that would be barred from supporting it.</p>

<h2 id="us-rebounds-adds-227000-jobs-in-november">US rebounds, adds
227,000 jobs in November</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s job market rebounded in November, adding
227,000 workers in a solid recovery from the previous month, when the
effects of strikes and hurricanes sharply diminished employers’
payrolls.</p>
<p>Last month’s hiring growth was up considerably from a meager gain of
36,000 jobs in October. The government also revised up its estimate of
job growth in September and October by a combined 56,000.</p>
<p>Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the
unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% in October to a still-low 4.2%.
Hourly wages rose 0.4% from October to November and 4% from a year
earlier — both solid figures and slightly higher than forecasters had
expected.</p>
<p>The November employment report provided the latest evidence that the
U.S. job market remains durable even though it has lost significant
momentum from the 2021-2023 hiring boom, when the economy was rebounding
from the pandemic recession. The job market’s gradual slowdown is, in
part, a result of the high interest rates the Federal Reserve engineered
in its drive to tame inflation.</p>
<p>The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Defying
predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing
rates for consumers and businesses. But since early this year, the job
market has been slowing.</p>
<p>Thomas Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies, wrote in a commentary
that the recovery from October’s strikes and hurricanes likely increased
last month’s payrolls by 60,000, suggesting that the job market is
strong enough to absorb most jobseekers but not enough to raise worries
about inflation.</p>
<p>Across industries last month, manufacturing companies added 22,000
jobs, reflecting the end of strikes at Boeing and elsewhere. Health care
companies added 54,000 jobs, government agencies 33,000, and bars and
restaurants 29,000. But retailers shed 28,000 jobs in November.</p>
<p>Americans have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the
government reported that layoffs fell to 1.6 million in October, below
the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the
same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3½-year low, a
sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has
cooled.</p>
<p>The overall economy has remained resilient. The much higher borrowing
costs for consumers and businesses that resulted from the Fed’s rate
hikes had been expected to tip the economy into a recession. Instead,
the economy kept growing as households continued to spend and employers
continued to hire.</p>
<p>The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on
healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a
decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped
from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.</p>

think gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare’s CEO left NYC on bus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health
insurer three days ago may have quickly left New York City on a bus
after escaping on a bicycle and hopping in a cab, police officials said
Friday. </p>
<p>Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday’s shooting of UnitedHealthcare
CEO Brian Thompson showed him riding through Central Park and later
taking a taxi to a bus terminal, directly across from New Jersey, Chief
of Detectives Joseph Kenny told CNN. </p>
<p>Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of
him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said. “It’s
a very busy bus terminal, we want to make sure we have the right bus.
But we’re working through that right now, this is all new information,”
he said. </p>
<p>Investigators also believe the shooter left his backpack in Central
Park and were carrying out a massive sweep to find it, said police
Commissioner Jessica Tisch. </p>
<p>The reason for the killing remains unknown. New York City police say
evidence firmly points to it being a targeted attack. </p>
<p>The gunman who carried out the brazen ambush made sure to conceal his
identity with a mask during the shooting yet left a trail of evidence in
view of the nation’s biggest city and its network of security
cameras.</p>
<p>A law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Friday that
surveillance footage shows the suspect riding the subway and visiting
establishments in Manhattan, providing more clues about his actions in
the days before the ambush. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last
month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, according to the law
enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss details of the
ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of
anonymity. </p>
<p>Once in New York, he appeared to pay with cash in any establishment
where he was captured on camera, the official said. </p>
<p>Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar
wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain
additional information from a cellphone recovered from a pedestrian
plaza where the gunman fled after shooting Thompson outside his
company’s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio
City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. </p>
<p>Police have released photos of the suspected shooter that were taken
in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. The images,
showing an unmasked man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City
hostel, add to a collection of photos and video circulated since the
shooting — including footage of the attack itself, as well as images of
the suspected gunman stopping at a Starbucks beforehand.</p>
<p>Surveillance images from the shooting show the man wearing a hooded
jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face — a look that would
not have attracted attention on a chilly morning. </p>
<p>Investigators have learned the man lowered his mask at the front desk
of the hostel because he was flirting with the woman who checked him in,
the law enforcement official told the AP, leading to a photo of his
face. The woman told investigators that during that encounter she asked
to see his smile and he pulled down his mask, the official said. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the suspect used a fake New Jersey
identification card, the official said, when he checked in at the
hostel, which has a café along with shared and private rooms and is
blocks from Columbia University. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooter had at least some firearms training
and experience with guns, the official said. </p>
<p>Security video shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind,
firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing
to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk. </p>
<p>The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were scrawled on the
ammunition, two law enforcement officials told the AP on Thursday. The
messages mirror the phrase “delay, deny, defend,” which is commonly used
by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims
and defend their actions. </p>
<p>Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had
been with Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO
for more than three years. </p>
<p>The insurer’s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding
its annual meeting in New York for investors. The company abruptly ended
the conference after Thompson’s death. </p>
<p>UnitedHealth Group said it was focused on supporting Thompson’s
family, ensuring the safety of employees and assisting investigators.
“While our hearts are broken, we have been touched by the huge
outpouring,” the company said. </p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million
Americans. It manages health insurance coverage for employers and state
and federally funded Medicaid programs. </p>
<p>In October, UnitedHealthcare was named along with Humana and CVS in a
Senate report detailing how its denial rate for prior authorizations for
some Medicare Advantage patients has surged in recent years. </p>
<p>The shooting has shaken corporate America and the health insurance
industry in particular, causing companies to reevaluate security plans
and delete photos of executives from their websites. A different
Minnesota-based health care company said Friday it was temporarily
closing its offices out of an abundance of caution, telling employees to
work from home.</p>

solar applications. About a third of that land would be in Nevada. But
the state’s rural county governments have no authority over federal
lands, and most of the state’s territory overall is under control of
BLM. This means their ordinances are relatively toothless, county
officials say, not to mention they get less revenue from solar farms.
Nevada’s Republican Governor Joe Lombardo has therefore asked BLM to
cancel the plan. “Opposition from Nevada means that if there’s a way to
unravel the programmatic solar plan when Donald Trump takes office in
January, there’ll be a will,” Holzman wrote.

<li>Decrease in cloud cover linked to rising global temperatures
</h3>
<p>
For the last two years or so, climate scientists have been puzzled by
the exceptional warmth seen across the planet, because it exceeds their
models. But new research points to a possible explanation: fewer clouds.
The
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_MaXLS1sCGAWWcEE0QpVr7BAJwsMbXuFnD8ArswTP83Pr8MnbbDvzwVptCPabn64R0cuhn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>,
published in the journal <em><em>Science</em></em>, found that 2023 saw
“a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics,”
and especially over the Atlantic. Since clouds help the Earth reflect
solar radiation back into space, fewer clouds means more radiation and –
you guessed it – more heat. Why might the clouds be disappearing? The
scientists say several factors could be at play, including the El Niño
weather pattern, and a rapid decline in sulfate aerosol emissions from
the shipping industry. But another explanation is that rising global
temperatures are changing how clouds behave, creating an ominous
feedback loop. But nobody is sure just yet, and lots of questions
remain. “I consider our study just another piece of the puzzle,”

It would be easy to feel down about the state of electric vehicles with
an avowed EV foe set to reenter the White House. Yes, the election’s
fallout will no doubt reshape the car market in the years to come. But
in the short term, there’s good news in the form of the new slate of EVs
already in the pipeline. For those looking to ditch their fossil
fuel-burner for an electric model, there’s plenty to be excited about in
2025.

<h3>
A Slate of Shiny New Crossovers
</h3>
<p>
Having long since displaced the minivan and the sedan as America’s
family car, the crossover is the most important piece of the electric
car market, and the biggest seller. Next year, we’ll welcome a slew of
new models.
</p>
<p>
Hyundai’s Ioniq EVs have been a hit, with the hatchback/crossover hybrid
Ioniq 5 selling impressive numbers (more than 30,000 in the first three
quarters of 2024) and the quirky Ioniq 6 sedan earning rave reviews. The
Korean brand will be filling out more Ioniq numbers in the years to
come, and 2025’s major arrival in terms of size and importance is the
three-row <strong>Ioniq 9</strong> SUV. The sharp-looking big boy joins
the EV9 by Hyundai’s partner brand, Kia, in offering a more affordable
EV for those who need to move six or seven people at a time.

Audi was a pioneer offerer of EVs in America: The original Audi e-Tron
came to the U.S. in 2019, when Tesla was just starting to sell the Model
3 and many legacy brands had yet to enter the electric market. That
model’s 204-mile range looks puny and outdated by today’s standards,
however. Next year, Audi is slated to roll out a much-anticipated update
to the lineup with the <strong>Q6 e-tron</strong> (and its A6 e-tron
sedan counterpart) delivering a respectable 350 miles of battery power.

The EV startups are expanding their lineups, too. No, we won’t see the
new, more affordable Rivians until at least 2026. Lucid, however, plans
to inflate the successful Air sedan up to the size of a three-row SUV
when it introduces the <strong>Gravity</strong>, which it claims will
deliver 440 miles of range. The story is similar at Polestar, where the
upcoming <strong>Polestar 3</strong> SUV looks like an expanded version
of the Polestar 2 sedan that’s been on sale for several years now.
</p>
<p>
Remember Chrysler? The erstwhile member of Detroit’s Big Three had
withered to a brand that, in the U.S., sells only minivans and the
obsolete 300 sedan. Stellantis (parent company of Chrysler, Ram, Jeep,
and others) has pinned its hopes for an American revival on
electrification, which includes an <strong>EV Chrysler
crossover</strong> planned for 2025. It looks to be called the
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chrysler/airflow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Airflow</u></a>
and will target the Ford Mustang Mach-E as its competitor.

The same is true of another decaying American giant. Cadillac, fresh off
some success with the Lyriq EV (20,000-plus sold through Q3 2024), is
pushing out a slate of electric vehicles in the hopes of reminding
buyers of its former glory. The smaller <strong>Optiq</strong>,
three-row <strong>Vistiq</strong>, and extravagant <strong>Escalade iq
</strong>are soon to join the brand’s EV lineup, the latter bringing the
icon of early 2000s wealth-bragging into the electric age.

<h3>
EVs Go Off-Road
</h3>
<p>
For those who swear by the go-anywhere potential of the true 4x4,
battery power is a tough sell — there aren’t too many plugs in the
backcountry. Yet as EV driving ranges get longer and EVs get more
capable, the icons of off-roading are coming around.
</p>
<p>
Jeep, which has introduced plug-in hybrid models of some of its
best-selling SUVs, is at last taking the all-electric plunge. No, you
won’t be able to buy an EV Jeep Wrangler, which is still years away.
(Stellantis is being cautious with its icon.) But we are on the cusp of
having the <strong>Jeep Recon</strong>, a mid-size EV 4x4, as well as an
EV version of the big, luxe Wagoneer called the <strong>Jeep Wagoneer
S</strong>.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Wagoneer won’t be alone in the market for expensive luxury SUV EVs. Land
Rover is telling anyone who’ll listen about the

testing</u></a> it is now performing on the upcoming <strong>Range Rover
EV</strong>, subjecting prototypes to the 120-degree heat of the UAE’s
desert. Arriving soon alongside the electric Range Rover is the
battery-powered version of <strong>Mercedes-Benz’s G-Wagen</strong>, a
$170,00 status symbol.
</p>
<h3>
Odds and Ends
</h3>
<p>
We may be on the cusp of seeing the titans of muscle embrace
electricity. At last month’s L.A. Auto Show, Dodge’s machismo-dripping
presentation of the <strong>Charger Daytona EV</strong>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxtJ5yi_yps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a>
the brawny battery-powered pony car would “save our planet … from all
those lame, soulless, weak-looking, self-driving sleep pods.” With
silent power that more than matches its combustion days, the Charger
should win converts to the church of instantaneous electric torque. Oh,
and in 2025, we just might get a look at the <strong>fully electric
Chevy Corvette</strong> that’s in the works.

<p>
For those with no interest in dropping a wheelbarrow of cash on an
electric sports car, fear not: The <strong>Chevy Bolt</strong> is coming
back. The plucky, affordable Bolt was the best-selling non-Tesla EV when
GM suddenly gave it the axe to focus on its Ultium EV platform.
Chevrolet says it’ll release the new, Ultium-based Bolt in 2025, and
that this version will feature faster charging and other bells and
whistles lacking in the original car.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the most fascinating offering to come next year is the
2025<strong> Ram 1500 Ramcharger</strong>, the first time
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/range-extender-r" target="_self"><u>range-extender
EV technology</u></a> comes to one of America’s best-selling vehicles.
Like a normal EV, the Ramcharger has electric motors to propel it, a
battery to store electricity, and can be plugged in to charge the
battery, however, it also carries a gasoline engine that can turn on to
recharge the battery when necessary. If this hopefully seamless version
of a hybrid convinces America’s legion of truck buyers, it’ll go a long
way toward advancing the pace of EV adoption.

id="trump-picks-former-senator-david-perdue-as-ambassador-to-china">Trump
picks former Senator David Perdue as ambassador to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he has chosen
former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former
politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by
deep mistrust and trade tensions. </p>
<p>“He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain
Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s
leaders,” Trump said in a post on Thursday on his social media platform
Truth Social. </p>
<p>Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he will impose an
additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop
the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. </p>
<p>He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on
the campaign trail. </p>
<p>Perdue, a Republican from Georgia who served in the Senate from
2015-2021, previously lived in Hong Kong during a 40-year career as a
business executive. </p>
<p>His nomination marks a return to the frequent practice over recent
decades of sending former politicians to the U.S. embassy in Beijing,
after President Joe Biden tapped veteran career diplomat Nicholas Burns
in 2021. </p>
<p>Perdue posted on X that he understood the gravity of the
ambassadorship and looked forward to “implementing President Trump’s
strategy.” He also said he appreciated how Burns had represented U.S.
interests in the job, who in turn on the social media site wished Perdue
“every success.”  </p>
<p>Democrats in the U.S. have complained that in his career as a
business executive, including at sporting goods company Reebok, Perdue
relied on outsourcing American manufacturing jobs to Asia, a practice
Trump has railed against and vowed to end.  </p>
<p>Trump has nominated China hardliners for other senior roles in his
administration, including Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, in
a signal his policy toward the United States’ main strategic rival could
go beyond trade measures. </p>
<p>In his first term as president, Trump named former Iowa Governor
Terry Branstad as his ambassador to China. Branstad sought to leverage
his ties with Chinese officials, including with Xi Jinping before he
became China’s top leader, to help navigate trade tensions. But the two
sides still plunged headlong into an unprecedented trade war. </p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry said at a regular briefing in Beijing that
it had “noted the reports” of Perdue’s nomination, but did not
elaborate.  </p>
<p>The role Trump’s ambassador will play in fraught U.S.-China relations
remains to be seen. Some analysts say Beijing is likely to seek direct
presidential or high-level engagement with Trump and his closest
advisers, in order to navigate the potential escalation of trade
tensions.</p>

<h2 id="biden-lights-national-christmas-tree">Biden lights National
Christmas Tree</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended
the annual National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony Thursday night on
the Ellipse, south of the White House.</p>
<p>“During this season of reflection,” Biden said, “may we continue to
seek the light of liberty and love, kindness and compassion, dignity and
decency.”</p>
<p>The president said the event is a favorite of his wife’s and that she
was sorry to miss this year’s event. First lady Jill Biden is in Qatar
for her initiative on women’s health.</p>
<p>Country singing star Mickey Guyton hosted this year’s event.</p>
<p>The tree lighting was launched in 1923 when first lady Grace Coolidge
allowed the District of Columbia Public Schools to erect a 48-foot
balsam fir on the Ellipse. Three thousand people attended the ceremony
that year when President Calvin Coolidge lit the tree, which came from
Middlebury College in Vermont.</p>
<p>This year’s tree, a 30-foot red spruce from Virginia, is anchored by
steel cables after strong winds blew over last year’s tree.</p>
<p>Americans from every U.S. state and territory and the District of
Columbia create the one-of-a-kind ornaments that adorn the tree as it
glows with thousands of lights.</p>
<p>Trisha Yearwood, James Taylor, Stephen Sanchez and Trombone Shorty
were among the musical guests who performed at this year’s holiday
event.</p>
<p>The show will be broadcast on December 20 on CBS-TV.</p>

id="iran-more-comfortable-with-nuclear-saber-rattling-us-intelligence-warns">Iran
more comfortable with nuclear saber-rattling, US intelligence warns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Iran is likely to respond to new attacks from Israel or
additional Western sanctions by edging ever closer to crossing the
nuclear threshold, according to a just-released U.S. intelligence
assessment.</p>
<p>The unclassified report, issued Thursday by the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence, finds that while Tehran is not
currently poised to build a nuclear weapon, it is undertaking activities
“that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.”</p>
<p>The report states that since July, Iran has continued to increase its
stockpiles of 20% and 60% enriched uranium while also manufacturing and
operating a growing number of advanced centrifuges.</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence assessment further warns that Iranian officials
have been increasingly willing to “publicly discuss the utility of
nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>“Tehran has the infrastructure and experience to quickly produce
weapons-grade uranium at multiple underground facilities, if it so
chooses,” the report says. “Iranian leaders recognize that this bolsters
the credibility of threats to develop nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>The ODNI report estimates that Iran’s existing stockpiles of enriched
uranium far exceed what it needs for civilian purposes and that Tehran
could build “more than a dozen nuclear weapons if its total uranium
stockpile were further enriched.”</p>
<p>A U.S. intelligence assessment of Iran’s capabilities issued this
past July similarly said that officials in Tehran were becoming more
comfortable talking about the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But the new report suggests Tehran is now prepared to push back
against Western pressure, attacks or other threats with more nuclear
activity.</p>
<p>“Iran probably will consider installing or operating more advanced
centrifuges, further increasing its enriched uranium stockpile,
enriching uranium up to 90 percent, or threatening to withdraw from the
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” according to the
latest ODNI assessment.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have previously warned that Tehran could produce a
nuclear warhead in as little as one to two weeks, though they have also
said the Pentagon has options to stop an Iranian nuclear breakout.</p>
<p>The Iranian mission at the United Nations has yet to respond to a
request for comment.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence analysts say that their concerns extend beyond
nuclear weapons to include Iran’s ballistic missile and drone
capabilities.</p>
<p>The U.S. assessment says Iran “almost certainly is incorporating
lessons learned from its missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
attack against Israel in April and from Russia’s operational use of
Iranian UAVs against Ukraine.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence additionally “expects Tehran will incorporate
performance data from the close-range ballistic missiles it transferred
to Russia once they are used in operational conditions.”</p>
<p>And help from Russia could also boost Iran’s work on multiple
space-launch missiles, possibly shortening the timeline for Tehran to
produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, the ODNI report
warns.</p>
<p>A second unclassified intelligence report released Thursday detailed
additional Iranian support for Moscow.</p>
<p>Iran “probably is training and assisting Russian soldiers in UAV
[drone] operations,” it said, adding, “Moscow and Tehran also have
agreed to establish a joint production line in Russia for lethal
UAVs.”</p>

Federal employment numbers come out Friday, so we’ve got a labor-packed
episode. First up, job growth in evergreen or “secular” industries is
strong (think health care) while cyclical jobs (think manufacturing)
have been stagnant. Then, wage gains are outpacing inflation, but some
workers aren’t feelin’ it. We’ll also hear from seasonal employees in
Vermont and a mall manager in Montana who’s moving on.

id="emerging-anti-us-axis-worrisome-but-not-acting-as-a-bloc">Emerging
anti-US axis worrisome but ‘not acting as a bloc’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Washington’s most dangerous adversaries may be working
together more closely than ever before, but U.S. intelligence analysts
think that for now, they are falling short of forming a tight-knit
alliance that could more effectively counter the United States.</p>
<p>Concerns among the United States and its allies about growing
cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been
increasing steadily since Moscow launched its February 2022 invasion of
Ukraine — sustained by intelligence showing Beijing, Tehran and
Pyongyang providing Russia with technology, missiles, drones and even
troops for the war effort.</p>
<p>The former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific earlier this
year went as far as to describe the growing ties between the four U.S.
adversaries as a nascent “axis of evil.”</p>
<p>Yet U.S. intelligence officials believe the axis, in some ways, has
been bogged down by its own shortcomings.</p>
<p>“They’re not acting as a bloc,” said Director of National
Intelligence Avril Haines, speaking Thursday in Washington at the
Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“We don’t see them as a sort of four-part alliance or something along
those lines,” she said. “We don’t see them likely as becoming allies in
the same way that we are allies with our NATO partners, for example —
that kind of level of interoperability and military collaboration.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence analysts, however, still see the axis as a concern
on several fronts.</p>
<p>Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and
North Korea has contributed to a further erosion of international norms
around weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Where Russia and China were once more willing to cooperate with the
United States and the West on nuclear counterproliferation, Moscow and
Beijing now seem more inclined to give Iran and North Korea additional
leeway.</p>
<p>“In large part, that’s because Russia is now beholden to some extent
to both the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and to Iran for
advanced weapons, for ammunition, for things that they need in the
context of their fight with Ukraine,” Haines said.</p>
<p>“They’re less likely to push back,” she said. “And of course, we’ve
been watching the degree to which they actually, for example, accept
DPRK as a nuclear weapon power.”</p>
<p>Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and
North Korea has helped all four countries to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>And she said there are even some indications that Russia is willing
to take action that would allow Beijing to surpass the U.S. in critical
areas.</p>
<p>“They’re willing to potentially put more on the table with China to
give them things that could actually make China sort of leapfrog in
certain technology areas or in other spaces that are of concern to us,”
Haines said.</p>
<p>Washington’s NATO allies have sounded similar alarms in recent
months, with some NATO officials telling VOA the axis has already
sparked the beginnings of a new global arms race.</p>
<p>Russian sabotage</p>
<p>There are also ongoing concerns about the willingness of Russia,
China, Iran and North Korea to engage in so-called gray zone
activity.</p>
<p>A declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate issued in July
warned that the next five to six years are “likely to feature more
frequent, diverse and damaging acts of coercion and subversion —
particularly by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea — below what
constitutes armed conflict but outside the bounds of historically
legitimate statecraft.”</p>
<p>Haines on Thursday said Russian gray zone activities — including
efforts at sabotage in Europe — have been “increasing across the
board.”</p>
<p>“Russia has just invested money, personnel, just an extraordinary
amount of effort in this area and just will continue to do so,” she
said. “And even though we are getting a little better at disrupting some
of this activity, we’re certainly not, I think, where it makes anybody
really comfortable.”</p>
<p>US presidential transition</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence analysts are keeping a close watch on how other
countries are behaving as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald
Trump to take office in January.</p>
<p>“There are certain actors that are trying to pre-position themselves
for a next administration,” Haines said.</p>
<p>She said intelligence analysts are preparing reports on the activity
to share with the incoming Trump administration, as well as keeping an
eye out for the potential that some countries may seek to escalate
tensions during the transition period.</p>
<p>“Typically, for example, the DPRK engages in some provocative action
during transitions,” Haines said. “This is sort of one of the classic
things we’re constantly looking at.”</p>

only about four inches to its height. Unless you happen to see one
during the 10 or 12 days in May that pale pink flowers cover its
branches, it’s not a shrub you’re likely to call one of the Sonoran
Desert’s most attractive flora — gnarled and hunched, the ironwood lacks
both the alien charm of the Joshua tree and the iconic flamboyance of
the Saguaro cactus. It makes up for this with its longevity: Some
ironwoods growing in the hills east of the Coachella Valley have clung
there 400 years longer than California has been a state. Adequately
protected, those very same trees could plausibly still be standing for
our successors to marvel at in the year 2724 — 175 presidential terms
from now.
</p>
<p>
Who knows if they’ll still talk about President Joe Biden then — in 700
years, he’ll be as deep in the past as Edward II of England is now. But
if those ironwood trees are still standing, it could be because of him.
Biden has called the fight against climate change
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-climate-action-amazon-rainforest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
defining cause of his presidency</u></a>, and he views conservation and
the preservation of biodiversity as part and parcel of that legacy. His
30x30 executive order — which aims to set aside 30% of America’s lands
and waters for conservation by 2030 — was a week-one priority once he
took office.
</p>
<p>
Among his best remaining opportunities to add to his tally would be the
designation of Chuckwalla National Monument, a 660,000-acre stretch of
desert south of Joshua Tree National Park that is home to one-fifth of
the ironwood trees left in the world. The same goes for a sacred and
culturally significant region in the southwest corner of California
called Kw’tsán; about Sáttítla, a vulnerable volcanic landscape near Mt.
Shasta; about the Owyhee, a million-acre Oregon watershed that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/owyhee-canyonlands-monument-biden" target="_self"><u>sits
in the crosshairs</u></a> of mining and energy development; and about
the homestead in Maine that belonged to Frances Perkins, the first woman
to serve in the U.S. cabinet. The list goes on.
</p>
<p>
But with less than two months until Biden’s move-out day, environmental
advocates are starting to wonder whether he’ll ever get around to
fulfilling his promise.
</p>
<p>
“There are still several national monument campaigns that are ready to
go and awaiting the president’s signature, and those are the sorts of
things that could cement President Biden’s legacy as one of the great
conservation presidents of all time — <em><em>if</em></em> he takes
those steps here in the last few weeks,” Aaron Weiss, the deputy
director of the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan
conservation advocacy group, told me.
</p>
<p>
When Biden took office in 2021, roughly 293 million acres of the United
States fell under the protection of various federal laws,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/10/land-water-conservation-biden-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
12% of his 30% goal</u></a>. Since then, Biden has set aside another 1%,
or 37 million acres, for protection, including about 1.6 million acres
of new monuments under the Antiquities Act. So far, Biden has protected
slightly less land than President Bill Clinton did in his first term,
per the Center for Western Priorities’
<a href="https://westernpriorities.org/2024/06/president-biden-is-less-than-100000-acres-away-from-setting-a-conservation-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accounting</u></a>.
And every day that passes matters; the Center for American Progress has
found that the U.S. loses a football field’s worth of natural area every
30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Still, conservationists have celebrated Biden’s moves to set aside the
National Petroleum Reserve and the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,
and to expand Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument and San Gabriel
Mountains National Monument in California. “When you look at it from a
traditional land protection perspective, I think [the Biden
administration has] a strong record,” Chris Wood, the president and
chief executive officer of the conservation group Trout Unlimited, told
me.
</p>
<p>
And Mustafa Santiago Ali, the executive vice president of the National
Wildlife Federation, also told me not to discount Biden’s designation of
the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument in Illinois, the Emmett
Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in Illinois and
Mississippi, and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni — Ancestral Footprints of
the Grand Canyon National Monument in Arizona, even though they don’t
add substantial acreage to his totals. “Folks may not pay attention to
how important those monuments are — honoring folks who have sacrificed
in the past,” Ali said. Weiss, likewise, commended Biden and Secretary
of the Interior Deb Haaland for “acknowledging that you need Indigenous
stewardship to lead and be central to all public land management
decisions.”
</p>
<p>
As the remaining weeks of Biden’s tenure quietly tick by, there is
increasing anxiety about whether and when the president will reach for
the Antiquities Act again. Kristen Brengel, the senior vice president of
government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, told
me she hopes Biden will announce at least two more national monuments
between now and January 20.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, though, when it comes to the question of how much land Biden
will choose to set aside in the waning days of his administration, “the
limiting factor is time,” Ryan Houston, the executive director of the
Oregon Natural Desert Association, which has campaigned extensively for
the designation of an Owyhee National Monument, told me. “If we don’t
take action before Inauguration Day in January, then we’re entering at
least a two-, four-, or six-year period where there won’t be
opportunities to follow through and protect the Owyhee,” Houston went
on. “And that sets us back a long way.”
</p>
<p>
Organizers don’t get a tip-off ahead of time about where or what the
Biden administration is considering. Chuckwalla, with its ironwood
trees, rare reptiles, cultural sites, and Joshua Tree-adjacent wildlife
corridors, <em>seems</em> likely — Haaland visited it this spring, a
portentous sign according to advocates. Other would-be monuments like
the Owyhee in Oregon are less certain and may attract executive
attention only if Congress fails to roll it into
<a href="https://www.outdooralliance.org/blog/2024/eoy-land-package" target="_blank"><u>a
public lands omnibus</u></a> bill expected by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The clock has already run out for other key components of
Biden’s conservation legacy. “In the first month of his presidency, it
seemed like it would be great,” Brendan Cummings, the conservation
director of the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit focused on
endangered species protections, told me. With the president’s 30x30
executive order and his pause on federal fossil fuel leasing, it’d
“seemed like he was going to live up to his promises.”
</p>
<p>
Then came
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climate-president-bomb-biden-willow" target="_self"><u>the
Willow Project approval</u></a>, new
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-approves-more-exports-major-us-lng-terminals-2022-03-16/" target="_blank"><u>LNG
export terminal sign-offs</u></a>, and so many new oil and gas permits
that
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/30/biden-administration-oil-drilling-permits-outpace-trump-ee-00138376" target="_blank"><u>Biden
surpassed even Trump</u></a>. “One of the few areas where Biden has
actually been excellent is national monuments,” Cummings conceded. “But
everything else is sort of this mix of muddled middle or profoundly
disappointing.” He added, “Trump took us two steps back, and Biden took
us one step forward — so we’re still behind at the end of the day.”
</p>
<p>
Though the other advocates I spoke with for this story weren’t as sour
on Biden’s record as Cummings, many had a wishlist of items they’d hoped
Biden would address. Brengel of the NPCA had hoped there’d be more
climate resiliency funding for the National Parks, which have “been on
the frontlines of dealing with some of the most dramatic effects of
climate change.” Wood, at Trout Unlimited, was holding out for the
creation of a federal fund to deal with the legacy of abandoned mines
via a royalty on hard rock metals, the only commodity produced from
public lands that <em><em>doesn’t</em></em> have a surcharge or tax.
Weiss of Western Priorities wanted to see action on livestock grazing
reforms.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to feel <em><em>too</em></em> frustrated with the Biden
administration, though. Much of 2021 and 2022 were spent addressing
Trump administration policies and roll-backs, including restoring
protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National
Monuments. Biden’s executive powers had their limits, too. While one of
his administration’s conservation wins had been
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/climate/chaco-canyon-biden-protection.html" target="_blank"><u>blocking
the culturally significant lands around New Mexico’s Chaco
Canyon</u></a> from new oil and gas leasing, Trump will have a
relatively straightforward path
<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26098301/trump-interior-chaco-culture-national-historical-park-oil-gas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
reopening it</u></a> to drilling if he so chooses. “I think with the
cards that we had in our hands, Deb Haaland and Biden have done
everything they could do to protect this area,” Paul F. Reed, a
preservation archaeologist with Archaeology Southwest, which campaigned
to protect Chaco Canyon, told me. But “short of congressional action,
this area will continue to be a political football.” The same may again
be true for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante.
</p>
<p>
There is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-e17-kristina-costa" target="_self"><u>better
Trump-proofing</u></a> elsewhere. Jenny Rowland-Shea, the director of
public lands at the left-leaning advocacy group the Center for American
Progress, told me that for Trump to unwind Biden’s protections in the
Arctic, which were
<a href="https://foe.org/news/conservation-rule-arctic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>established
via a lengthier rule-making process</u></a>, the incoming president
would have to prove that the science behind the ecology subsistence
isn’t valid — a bigger lift. It’s part of why she feels comfortable
calling Biden’s actions in the Arctic one of the more significant pieces
of his conservation legacy.
</p>
<p>
Others pointed to the Bureau of Land Management’s
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/public-lands-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Public
Lands Rule</u></a>, which put conservation
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-boosts-conservation-in-blm-public-lands-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
equal footing</u></a> with other land uses like drilling this past
spring, as the real gift that Biden leaves behind. Wood, of Trout
Unlimited, told me that what he hopes will outlast the 46th president is
Biden’s approach to looking at conservation as a part of natural
resiliency, the effort to “make our lands more resistant to floods,
fires, and drought.” Meanwhile, Ali of NWF told me his wish is that
future presidents will use Biden’s accomplishments as a “north star” to
measure themselves against and surpass.
</p>
<p>
But Cummings of the Center for Biological Diversity believes there is
only one way for Biden to cement his legacy in the remaining weeks he
has in office. “Almost everything the president does gets forgotten,” he
said. “But the land that a president protects is forever.”

America’s oldest pet cemetery, humans spend eternity with faithful
companions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARTSDALE, NEW YORK — On most days, Mark Lindenberg either drives by
or walks over to visit with Boots, his beloved pet cat who died in
August 2020 at the age of 17. The New York man had his black-and-white
tuxedo cat buried at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery, a picturesque spot with
rolling, grassy hills near the main road.</p>
<p>The epitaph on Boots’ tombstone reads, “You taught me how to love and
be loved.”</p>
<p>Other tombstones are engraved with phrases such as “A truer friend we
never had” and “Our beloved queen.”</p>
<p>“Human cemeteries are sad,” Lindenberg says. “This is one of the most
cheerful places. When you look at the love that goes behind every plot
here — the sayings, the toys, the pinwheels — it’s just, I can’t think
of a better place.”</p>
<p>Hartsdale is America’s oldest working pet cemetery and was added to
the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Lindenberg says he
paid about $7,000 to bury Boots at Hartsdale. Those costs include the
plot, casket, tombstone, burial and site maintenance in perpetuity.</p>
<p>“What have I worked for if I’m not going to do the things that matter
most, and this mattered most,” Lindenberg says. “I got instant closure
the day I decided I was going to bury her here.”</p>
<p>Pet burials started in Hartsdale in 1896 when veterinarian Samuel
Johnson allowed a client to bury her dog in his apple orchard, a
hillside spot located about 30 kilometers north of New York City. Since
then, about 70,000 animals have been laid to rest in the 2-hectare
cemetery. Most of the pets buried at Hartsdale are cats and dogs, but
there are a few more exotic animals.</p>
<p>“There’s reptiles that are buried here. Mice,” says Edward Martin
III, vice president of the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery. “There’s a lion cub
that was buried here in 1912 by a Russian princess. There’s the ashes of
Ming, who’s a Bengal tiger that was buried here a few years ago. There
are some monkeys.”</p>
<p>There’s also Hudson the horse, some birds and singer Mariah Carey’s
cat, Clarence. The oldest headstone, dating to 1898, commemorates the
life of a dog named Blague.</p>
<p>Martin runs the place alongside his father, Edward Martin Jr., who
purchased the cemetery in 1974. The younger Martin is a lawyer and
certified public accountant, who eventually opted to help oversee the
cemetery, where he once worked as a teenager.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen what people go through, and they lose their pets, and I
feel like I’m in a good position where I can help them,” he says. “And I
have helped them, and it makes me want to continue helping them.”</p>
<p>Between 250 and 300 burials are conducted at Hartsdale each year. The
cemetery never runs out of space because not all of the graves are
permanent. People can pay a one-time forever maintenance fee of $3,500
or an annual fee of $105. If the annual fee stops being paid, that
gravesite is eventually offered for sale.</p>
<p>“The pet in the grave will be removed from that plot so someone else
who wants it can pay the maintenance. And the pets are taken out, and
they’re cremated, and they don’t leave the cemetery,” says Martin Jr.,
Hartsdale’s president. “Their remains are scattered over the cemetery
grass.”</p>
<p>A centerpiece at the cemetery is the war dog memorial at the top of a
hill. Unveiled in 1923, the monument was originally dedicated to World
War I service dogs. But these days, the memorial honors service dogs of
all kinds.</p>
<p>Although Hartsdale is primarily a resting place for animals, the
cremated remains of about 800 humans are buried here with their pets.
There’s even a Martin family plot, where the elder Martin plans to
eventually be laid to rest with other relatives.</p>
<p>“I have to be buried somewhere. And why would I go to any place other
than this?” he says. “My mother and father, and my mother-in-law or
father-in-law are buried here, and so, that’s a good reason by itself to
do it.”</p>
<p>Lindenberg also likes the idea. He has already arranged to be
cremated and buried alongside Boots when the time comes.</p>
<p>“I’m single. I don’t know if I’ll ever get married, and I can’t think
of a better place,” he says. “I lived with my cat every day for almost
17 years. Why stop now?”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lindenberg, who lives a 10-minute walk away, will
continue to visit his old friend almost daily.</p>

<h2 id="the-mad-dash-to-lock-down-bidens-final-climate-dollars">The Mad
Dash to Lock Down Biden’s Final Climate Dollars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE0MjgxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY0MTUwMX0.UgP0XIbU9dHODnqQV8U1KV467ug2DRX4JLATkZ5644Q/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Of the over $13 billion in loans and loan guarantees that the Energy
Department’s Loan Programs Office has made under Biden, nearly a third
of that funding has been doled out in the month since the presidential
election. And of the $41 billion in conditional commitments — agreements
to provide a loan once the borrower satisfies certain preconditions —
that proportion rises to nearly half. That includes some of the largest
funding announcements in the office’s history: more than
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-starplus-energy-construct-lithium-ion-battery" target="_blank"><u>$7.5
billion to StarPlus Energy</u></a> for battery manufacturing,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-grain-belt-express-construct-high-voltage-direct" target="_blank"><u>$4.9
billion to Grain Belt Express</u></a> for a transmission project, and
nearly
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-rivian-support-construction-ev-manufacturing" target="_blank"><u>$6.6
billion to the electric vehicle company Rivian </u></a>to support its
new manufacturing facility in Georgia.
</p>
<p>
The acceleration represents a clear push by the outgoing Biden
administration to get money out the door before President-elect Donald
Trump, who has threatened to hollow out much of the Department of
Energy, takes office. Still, there’s a good chance these recent
conditional commitments won’t become final before the new administration
takes office, as that process involves checking a series of nontrivial
boxes that include performing due diligence, addressing or mitigating
various project risks, and negotiating financing terms. And if the deals
aren’t finalized before Trump takes office, they’re at risk of being
paused or cancelled altogether, something the DOE considers unwise, to
put it lightly.
</p>
<p>
“It would be irresponsible for any government to turn its back on
private sector partners, states, and communities that are benefiting
from lower energy costs and new economic opportunities spurred by LPO’s
investments,” a spokesperson wrote to me in an email.
</p>
<p>
The once nearly dormant LPO has had a renaissance under the Biden
administration and the office’s current director, Jigar Shah. The
Inflation Reduction Act supercharged its lending authority to $400
billion, from just $40 billion when Biden took office. Then a week after
the election, the office announced that it had recalibrated its risk
estimates for the loan guarantees that it makes under the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/energy-infrastructure-reinvestment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy
Infrastructure Reinvestment</u></a> program, which works to modernize
and repurpose existing energy infrastructure to make it cleaner and more
energy efficient. As
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/updates-estimated-remaining-loan-authority-lpo-programs#:~:text=1706%20utility%20loans%20may%20reflect%20a%20relatively%20moderate%20risk%20profile%20in%20comparison%20to%20typical%20projects%20LPO%20finances%20with%20higher%20project%20risk.%20Therefore%2C%20less%20credit%20subsidy%20may%20be%20required%20for%20such%20projects%2C%20allowing%20LPO%20to%20potentially%20finance%20more%20projects.%C2%A0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
office explained,</u></a> these projects “may reflect a relatively
moderate risk profile in comparison to typical projects LPO finances
with higher project risk.” When there’s less risk involved, LPO doesn’t
have to set aside as much money to cover a possible default, which in
this case has allowed the office to
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/updates-estimated-remaining-loan-authority-lpo-programs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than quadruple</u></a> its funding for qualifying projects.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just that LPO staffers are working fast, though that’s part of
it — it’s also that loan beneficiaries have picked up their pace in
responding to the LPO. As Shah emphasized today at the LPO’s second
annual
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/events/deploy24" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Demonstrate
Deploy Decarbonize </u></a>conference, finalizing conditional
commitments largely depends on companies getting their ducks in a row as
quickly as possible. “I do think that right now borrowers are
sufficiently motivated to move more quickly than they have probably a
year ago,” Shah said. “It’s up to the borrowers. Our process hasn’t
changed. Their ability to move through it faster is in their control.”
</p>
<p>
Shah noted that though timelines may be accelerating, the office’s due
diligence procedures have remained the same. Thus far, the project that
has moved the fastest from a conditional commitment to a finalized loan
was for a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-first-loan-guarantee-clean-energy-project-nearly-decade" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean
hydrogen and energy storage facility</u></a> in Utah. That took 43 days,
and there are 46 left in Biden’s presidency. Let’s see what the LPO can
do.

earthquake off Northern California prompts tsunami warning</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook a large
area of Northern California on Thursday, knocking items off grocery
store shelves, sending school children scrambling under desks, and
prompting a brief tsunami warning for 5.3 million people along the U.S.
West Coast.</p>
<p>The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. west of Ferndale, a small city in
coastal Humboldt County, about 209 kilometers (130 miles) from the
Oregon border, the U.S. Geological Survey said.</p>
<p>It was felt as far south as San Francisco, some 435 kilometers (270
miles) away, where residents felt a rolling motion for several seconds.
It was followed by smaller aftershocks.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury.</p>
<p>The tsunami warning was in effect for roughly an hour. It was issued
shortly after the temblor struck and covered nearly 805 kilometers (500
miles) of coastline, from the edge of California’s Monterey Bay north
into Oregon.</p>
<p>“It was a strong quake. Our building shook. We’re fine, but I have a
mess to clean up right now,” said Julie Kreitzer, owner of Golden Gait
Mercantile, a store packed with food, wares and souvenirs that is a main
attraction in Ferndale.</p>
<p>“We lost a lot of stuff. It’s probably worse than two years ago. I
have to go, I have to try and salvage something for the holidays,
because it’s going to be a tough year,” Kreitzer said before hanging
up.</p>
<p>Shortly after the quake, phones in Northern California buzzed with
the tsunami warning from the National Weather Service that said, “A
series of powerful waves and strong currents may impact coasts near you.
You are in danger. Get away from coastal waters. Move to high ground or
inland now. Keep away from the coast until local officials say it is
safe to return.”</p>
<p>South of San Francisco in Santa Cruz, authorities cleared the main
beach, closing entrances with police tape.</p>
<p>Numerous cities urged people to evacuate to higher ground as a
precaution, including Eureka.</p>
<p>“I thought my axles had fallen apart,” said Valerie Starkey, a Del
Norte County supervisor representing Crescent City, a town of fewer than
6,000 about 106 kilometers (66 miles)) north of Eureka. “That’s what I
was feeling … ‘My axles are broken now.’ I did not realize it was an
earthquake.”</p>
<p>Eureka Mayor Kim Bergel said crews were assessing if there was any
major damage from the quake. Bergel, who works as a resource aid at a
middle school, said lights were swaying, and everyone got under
desks.</p>
<p>“The kids were so great and terrified. It seemed to go back and forth
for quite a long time,” she said. Some children asked, “Can I call my
mom?”</p>
<p>The students were later sent home.</p>
<p>Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal said residents experienced
some cracks in their homes’ foundations, as well as broken glass and
windows, but nothing severe. There also have been no major
infrastructure problems, building collapses or roadway issues, and no
major injuries or deaths have been reported, he said.</p>
<p>Honsal said he was in his office in the 75-year-old courthouse in
downtown Eureka when he felt the quake.</p>
<p>“We’re used to it. It is known as ‘earthquake country’ up here,” he
said. “It wasn’t a sharp jolt. It was a slow roller, but
significant.”</p>
<p>The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, known as BART,
stopped traffic in all directions through the underwater tunnel between
San Francisco and Oakland, and the San Francisco Zoo’s visitors were
evacuated.</p>
<p>Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator for the Tsunami Warning
Center in Alaska, said the computer models indicated that this was the
type of earthquake that was unlikely to cause a tsunami. And gauges that
monitor waves then confirmed it, so forecasters canceled the
warning.</p>
<p>This quake was a strike-slip type of temblor that shifts more
horizontally and is less prone to cause tsunamis, unlike the more
vertical types, said National Weather Service tsunami program manager
Corina Allen in Washington state.</p>
<p>The California Geological Survey says the state’s shores have been
struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor,
some have been destructive and deadly.</p>
<p>On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in
Alaska smashed into Crescent City hours later. Much of the business
district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed. More recently, a
tsunami from a 2011 earthquake in Japan caused about $100 million in
damages along the California coast, much of it in Crescent City.</p>

<h2 id="us-judge-rejects-boeing-plea-deal-in-fatal-737-max-crashes">US
judge rejects Boeing plea deal in fatal 737 MAX crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected Boeing’s agreement to plead guilty
to fraud in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes, faulting a diversity
and inclusion provision in the deal.</p>
<p>Boeing did not immediately comment. The U.S. Department of Justice,
which brokered the plea bargain with Boeing, is reviewing the opinion, a
spokesperson said. Boeing and the DOJ’s options could include appealing
the judge’s rejection of the plea deal or presenting a renegotiated
agreement for court approval.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, seized on a
single sentence in the plea agreement mentioning the DOJ’s diversity
policy regarding the selection of an independent monitor to audit the
plane maker’s compliance practices.</p>
<p>Boeing and the DOJ now have 30 days to update the court on how they
plan to proceed in the case, O’Connor ruled.</p>
<p>Judges weighing plea deals typically do not upend them over issues
that the parties to the agreement have not disputed. In the rare cases
that they do, it is usually because the judge wants to impose a
different punishment than prosecutors have agreed to.</p>
<p>The plea bargain also marginalizes the judge in the selection and
oversight of the independent monitor, and it forbids imposing a
probation condition requiring Boeing to comply with the monitor’s
anti-fraud recommendations, O’Connor said in his decision. He said the
agreement was “not in the public interest.”</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, which occurred
in 2018 and 2019 and killed 346 people, have called the plea agreement a
“sweetheart” deal that failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for
the deaths of their loved ones.</p>
<p>The two plane crashes occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia over a
five-month period. The families had briefly referenced the DOJ diversity
and inclusion policy in court filings opposing the plea agreement, but
did not detail concerns about it.</p>
<p>“Judge O’Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between” the
government and Boeing “that failed to focus on the overriding concerns:
holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that
nothing like this happens again in the future,” said Paul Cassell, a
lawyer representing the families.</p>
<p>Cassell said he hoped the decision would result in the agreement
being renegotiated to specifically address the passengers and crew who
perished in the plane crashes.</p>
<p>An accepted plea deal would have branded Boeing a convicted felon for
conspiring to defraud the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration about
problematic software affecting the flight control systems in the planes
that crashed.</p>
<p>Boeing had agreed to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million and spend
$455 million to improve safety and compliance practices over three years
of court-supervised probation as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Victims’ relatives want Boeing and its executives charged with crimes
holding them responsible for the deaths of their loved ones and any
evidence of wrongdoing presented in a public trial. They have also
argued Boeing should have to pay up to $24.78 billion in connection with
the crashes.</p>

Strategy for Renewable Energy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Today we’re talking with Tim Brightbill, a trade attorney at Wiley Rein
LLP and lead counsel for a coalition of U.S. solar cell and module
manufacturers – the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade
Committee. Last week, his
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/02/us-anti-dumping-tariffs-southeast-asia-solar-panels/" target="_blank"><u>client
won</u></a> a massive victory – fresh tariffs on south Asian solar panel
parts – on the premise that Chinese firms are dumping cheap products in
the region to drive down prices and hurt American companies. It’s the
latest in a long series of decadal trade actions against solar parts
with Chinese origin.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to talk to Tim about how this move could affect developers, if
an America-first strategy could help insulate solar from political
opposition, and how this could play out in next year’s talks over the
future of the IRA. The following conversation was lightly edited for
clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you were talking to a developer, what would you tell them
should be their takeaway? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the takeaway is that these determinations appear to go a long
way toward addressing the unfair trade that’s been present in solar
panels, solar cells, for more than a decade. And I think these duties do
send a signal that will help build up domestic manufacturing. We’ve seen
historic investment next to the Inflation Reduction Act in U.S. solar
manufacturing facilities – in places like Georgia with QCells, in Ohio
for First Solar – and we’re at a critically important point here.
</p>
<p>
Those investments were being undercut by this unfair trade by these
Chinese-owned companies. We think now hopefully that will be addressed
and that should lead to a bright future for solar deployment, the growth
of solar power in the United States.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does the pursuit of a fairer trade landscape globally in the
broader sense impact support for solar energy in the U.S.? I hear often
that a “made without China” approach can shore up support for
renewables. Do you find that to be the case? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Definitely, I find that to be the case.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. industry invented solar technology and perfected it. And then
unfortunately, it was virtually wiped out due to the unfair trade
practices of China and these Chinese-owned companies. If we want to have
solar and not be dependent on other countries for renewable energy
needs, the best way to do that is to have a strong manufacturing base
and a strong supply chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you think the direction of this is going to be under the
next administration? Even more ratcheting up of trade measures?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Well the trade laws are a calculation, right? They’re based on rules,
they’re not political. I don’t expect this administration to necessarily
change individual trade cases. But I do think trade policy will change
in a way that tries to address these Chinese-owned companies that
undercut the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
For example, the IRA provides right now potential benefits for any
company that sets up shop here, even if they are owned by a foreign
entity of concern. That seems like something this administration is
going to address. If you’re going to receive IRA money, you should not
be affiliated with a foreign entity of concern.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Given the potential for an impact on pricing, combined with the
impacts on limiting the tax credits in that way – wouldn’t that make it
harder to build projects in the U.S. short term? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think so. The solar panels themselves are not anywhere close to
the majority of the cost of a project. There are so many other things
that impact project cost, from permitting to the land. I don’t think
this will impact the costs of deployment of solar. It will just give us
a more secure supply chain that is either here in the United States or
at least more regional in nature, which is going to be better for the
industry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>With foreign entities of concern – are you referring to 45X?
You’re anticipating that tax credit will change with respect to the IRA?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I expect the Trump administration will focus on that. There are already
other related products under IRA where “foreign entity of concern”
participation is not allowed for those tax credits. So it seems like a
ready fix to ensure that is the same for solar technologies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is that bad news, or is that saving the credit? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think it’s bad news. I think it’s good news. It means more of
the credit will be available to U.S. companies and our allies who might
want to set up here as well.
</p>
<p>
If Chinese companies want to come here and set up in the United States,
that’s great, but they shouldn’t also receive subsidies because those
are the same companies that have harmed our industry with unfair trade
for more than a decade.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay enough serious talk. Can I ask you a fun question: what was
the last band you listened to? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s sort of dad rock-ish right now: Spoon. When I get my Spotify
Wrapped, it’s going to be Spoon. That’s my favorite rock band right now.

<p>
<strong>Sourcing requirements</strong> – As we explain in our Q&amp;A
today, there’s momentum building in Washington, D.C., to attach new
sourcing requirements to an IRA credit for advanced manufacturing known
as 45X.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
45X is supposed to supercharge production of battery and solar
components, as well as key minerals and materials for those components
that are largely imported from China or what U.S. trade officials
believe are Chinese pass-throughs.
</li>
<li>
Some U.S. companies are now quietly urging Congress to enact a “foreign
entity of concern” requirement to 45X that would essentially stop
battery and solar manufacturing plants with Chinese business involvement
from qualifying.
</li>
<li>
Why? Well, doing this would definitely insulate the credit from GOP
repeal by tying it not to rapid decarbonization but instead American
blue collar jobs.
</li>
<li>
Patrick Donnelly, chief commercial officer for Anovion, told attendees
of a Hill briefing I moderated earlier this week that he wants to see
this happen because it would be a “game changer” for domestic
manufacturing. “I’ve heard some Republicans talking about it already.”
</li>
<li>
But it could also undermine the effectiveness of the credit for climate
purposes. Similar requirements were tacked onto the IRA’s EV consumer
credit that curtailed its reach and meant many cars couldn’t access the
benefit.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Virginia’s planning </strong>– The state of Virginia is looking

few GOP-led states to do so.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The state’s commission on electricity regulation proposed a
<a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6386&s=7" target="_blank"><u>draft
plan</u></a> late last month that would enable companies to appeal local
rejections. Under that plan, the state would create a siting advisory
board that would give insights as to whether a rejection was contrary to
the overall state’s power needs.<br/>
</li>
<li>
It’s not a sure shot. The commission acknowledged legislation will be
necessary to make this plan a reality, and the state’s divided
government has rarely found agreement with energy policies. But all
those Virginia data centers are going to need power from somewhere.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here’s what else we’re watching…

Secret Service chief touts reforms after Trump assassination
attempts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Secret Service’s acting director told a U.S.
House of Representatives panel on Thursday that he has overhauled the
agency’s security practices after a gunman shot President-elect Donald
Trump in July.</p>
<p>Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified to a House task force
consisting of seven Republicans and six Democrats that has been
investigating two failed assassination attempts on Trump during this
year’s presidential campaign. Things grew heated at times.</p>
<p>The panel is expected to vote on the approval of a final report later
on Thursday.</p>
<p>“It is essential that we recognize the gravity of our failure on July
13, 2024. I personally carry the weight of knowing that we almost lost a
protectee and that our failure cost a father and husband his life,” Rowe
testified.</p>
<p>“This entire incident represents the failure to meet the expectations
and responsibilities of the Secret Service.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service has faced questions over its staffing levels and
communication capabilities following the Trump assassination
attempts.</p>
<p>A gunman fired eight shots during a Trump campaign rally in Butler,
Pennsylvania in July, wounding Trump in the ear and killing another
attendee. The gunman was shot and killed by a Secret Service
counter-sniper.</p>
<p>Two months later, a man with a gun holed himself up near a
Trump-owned golf course in Florida with what prosecutors have said was
an intent to kill the then-Republican candidate while he golfed.</p>
<p>The suspect, Ryan Routh, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges
and is awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Rowe earned praise from many Republican lawmakers for cooperating
with the investigation, but he erupted at Republican Representative Pat
Fallon after the congressman questioned Rowe’s appearance at a ceremony
this year commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks.</p>
<p>“Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes!” Rowe yelled, adding that
he responded to the World Trade Center site following the attack and
attended the ceremony to represent the Secret Service. “You are out of
line, Congressman.”</p>
<p>Fallon said he was asking “serious questions” about whether Rowe was
there to provide protection for high-level officials at the
ceremony.</p>
<p>Rowe has said he was “ashamed” of security lapses surrounding the
Pennsylvania shooting. He defended the agency’s response in the Florida
incident, commending an agent who spotted the gunman before he could
open fire.</p>
<p>Rowe said he has made a series of changes following the shooting,
including increasing training for agents, streamlining communication
with local law enforcement and boosting the size of Trump’s security
detail.</p>
<p>Rowe testified that he has sought to eliminate what he called a
“do-more-with-less mindset” at the Secret Service, which he said had a
“degrading effect” on the agency. He said the agency was remedying its
staffing shortage of recent years and was on pace to hire 650 special
agents and 350 uniformed officers in the coming months.</p>
<p>The rally shooting shook confidence in the Secret Service, damaging
its elite “zero fail” reputation for protecting presidents and
high-level dignitaries to the U.S.</p>
<p>The Secret Service has largely been exempt from Trump’s criticisms of
federal law enforcement and vows to overhaul government, but the
agency’s response to the Pennsylvania shooting drew bipartisan
condemnation.</p>
<p>An interim report from the House task force, released in October,
found a lack of planning between the Secret Service and local law
enforcement ahead of the July rally.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Mike Kelly, the chair of the task force,
credited Rowe with implementing reforms and calling out what he called a
culture of complacency in the agency.</p>
<p>Kelly said when Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, for another
rally in October, the difference in the security posture was “like the
difference between day and night.”</p>

<h2 id="police-seek-suspect-in-unitedhealthcare-shooting">Police seek
suspect in UnitedHealthcare shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York City police investigators continue to search for the suspect
in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was
attacked by a gunman who apparently was waiting for him on a New York
sidewalk early Wednesday.</p>
<p>Police say multiple surveillance cameras captured the shooting and
the moments after. In one video taken closest to the shooting at about
6:45 a.m., Thompson, 50, can be seen walking on a sidewalk to
UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference at a Hilton hotel in
midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>A moment later, a figure wearing a hooded jacket, dark glasses and a
backpack steps out from behind a parked vehicle and raises a handgun
that appears to have a noise suppressor, or silencer, attached and fires
several shots.</p>
<p>Thompson was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced
dead.</p>
<p>Other cameras caught the gunman mounting an e-bike and heading into
the city’s Central Park. Police are now investigating whether the
vehicle was an unmarked e-bike or one that is part of the city’s Citi
Bike share system, as initially reported.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday revealed the words “Deny,” “Defend” and “Depose”
were printed on the 9-millimeter shell casings found at the scene. Some
analysts believe the words may have been a reference to strategies
insurance companies use to avoid paying claims.</p>
<p>At an initial news conference on Wednesday, New York Police
Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that while it was clear the attack on
Thompson was premeditated, the motive is unclear.</p>
<p>She said the cameras showed that the suspect waited for several
minutes for Thompson, and that he had at least some prior firearms
training.</p>
<p>Thompson had been with Minneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004
and served as CEO for more than three years. The New York Times reported
that the company, which offers insurance to companies and individuals,
has a market valuation of $560 billion, making it one of the country’s
largest publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The Times also reported the company has come under scrutiny from
lawmakers and regulators, who accused it of systematically refusing to
authorize health care procedures and treatments.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a
report in October documenting insurance companies’ refusal to pay for
the care of older people who had suffered strokes or medical
emergencies.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare in particular was cited for a surge in denials in
post-acute care when it increased to 22.7% in 2022 from 10.9% in
2020.</p>
<p>Thompson’s wife, Paulette, told U.S. broadcaster NBC News that he had
received death threats.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>

according to TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyenne, meaning we have our
first offshore wind derailment of the Trump era, many weeks before he’s
even taken office.<br/>
</li>
<li>
It’s unclear <em><em>how</em></em> connected Trump is to the move.
Attentive Energy also pulled out of New York state’s fifth offshore wind
solicitation
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/offshore-wind-bidder-drops-out-in-new-york/" target="_blank"><u>before
this news dropped</u></a>, which also arrived days before the Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management implemented new requirements for projects built
in the area

the project would be built</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
However, remember that even though Attentive Energy has little
opposition in New York State, anti-offshore activists are aggressively
challenging efforts by New Jersey state to
<a href="https://ocnjdaily.com/news/2024/mar/06/grassroots-groups-file-appeal-of-offshore-wind-con/" target="_blank"><u>buy
power from the project</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We’ll have to wait and see if this decision is a domino for other
offshore wind curtailments. But we’re already seeing evidence, as Shell
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-slows-investments-offshore-wind-splits-power-business-2024-12-04/" target="_blank"><u>announced
hours ago</u></a> it is no longer investing in new offshore wind
projects.

<p>
<span></span><strong>Clinton County, Michigan</strong> – EV
manufacturing news in Michigan is showing that fallout from Trump’s
election may not be limited to offshore wind, and could creep into other
projects facing grassroots opposition.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Two manufacturing sites planned for construction in the Mitten State
were quietly canceled over the Thanksgiving holiday. The

on large swathes of rural land and led to local opposition against
so-called “industrial” sites on farmland – a conflict similar to
problems we see in solar energy.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The manufacturing plants under development by a Michigan economic
development corporation were marketed as compatible with EV and
microchip production as the state was angling to be a zero-emission tech
hub. Both industries may lose federal subsidies under the now
GOP-controlled Congress.
</li>
<li>
Then General Motors sold its stake in a separate battery plant, because

<p>
<strong>Linn County, Iowa </strong>– Even carbon pipelines facing
opposition are getting canceled right now, after Wolf Carbon Solutions
rescinded its project application to the Iowa Utilities Board.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Like other projects – Summit, Navigator – the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJvBeyOhtF0" target="_blank"><u>Wolf

project would cross multiple Iowa counties and extend into
Illinois.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“While Wolf has continued to build relationships with landowners and
stakeholders interested in the Project, a number of factors have
continued to delay Wolf’s ability to proceed with the Project and Wolf
has decided to cease pursuit of the required regulatory approvals at
this time,” the company stated in a filing to the utilities board on
Monday.
</li>
<li>
As we’ve explained, carbon pipelines should get at least some support
from the Trump 2.0 administration. But as Wolf may show, the projects
most likely to benefit will be those already far enough along in
permitting to withstand the market uncertainties created by political
instability,

<h2 id="inside-nevadas-solar-energy-revolt">Inside Nevada’s Solar Energy
Revolt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE1MDc4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODU5MDA1MH0.DnhsmgWVD8Q4M9DEhbIjsuw9kq_P9Y9DnFQVKtEXwn4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Nevada, ground zero for solar development in the American West, is now
seeing a different kind of renewables revolution – against development.
</p>
<p>
It might endanger the Biden administration’s crowning solar permitting
achievement, and will mean developers in the Silver State will have to
reckon with empowered opponents in the Trump 2.0 era.
</p>
<p>
The Bureau of Land Management’s Western
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar
plan</u></a> would open more than 31 million acres available for
utility-scale solar applications across almost a dozen states. About a
third of that land would be in Nevada. Nevada is
<a href="https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Nevada.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the top states</u></a> in the U.S. for solar development and
utility-scale construction spiked after passage of the Inflation
Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
Rural county governments are hopping mad over the effort. Many officials
want to do what their friends in other states can do – pass moratoria
and restrict development in line with local complaints. They’ve been
passing their local rules. But there’s a big X factor: They have no
authority over federal lands, and most of the state’s territory overall
is under control of BLM.
</p>
<p>
This means their ordinances are relatively toothless, county officials
say, not to mention they get less revenue from solar farms.
</p>
<p>
“There are impacts to residents, to county services, to how we deliver
services from solar energy projects, that frankly aren’t being
addressed,” said Vinson Guthreau, executive director of the Nevada
Association of Counties, which has formally protested the BLM solar plan
after backlash with members. “And there’s zero way to capture revenue
from resources on federal land — we cannot collect taxes on federal
land. We receive all of the impacts and none of the revenue to fund the
impacts, frankly.”
</p>
<p>
Enter Nevada’s Republican Governor Joe Lombardo. In an Oct. 28 letter
obtained by Heatmap, Lombardo stated “discouraging feedback” from local
officials and state agencies led him to ask BLM to cancel its west-wide
comprehensive solar plan. Among his complaints: many objections from
local leaders and concerns raised by environmentalists about impacts on
imperiled tortoises and sage grouse. (Yes, this means the GOP governor
of Nevada is on the same side as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>the
Center for Biological Diversity</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
“The vast tracts of land identified,” Lombardo wrote, “places enormous
pressure on our rural counties, many of which rely on public lands for
agriculture, grazing, mining, recreation, and community development, and
threatens to overwhelm local land-use plans and disrupt the economic and
social fabric of our communities.”
</p>
<p>
Opposition from Nevada means that if there’s a way to unravel the
programmatic solar plan when Donald Trump takes office in January,
there’ll be a will. That’s what happened with the Obama administration’s
<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/feds-to-relax-rules-protecting-sage-grouse-in-nevada-10-other-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sage
grouse habitat protection</u></a> efforts. Other western states opposed
Obama sage grouse protection plans, but Nevada – a key swing state – was
a dissenting voice that really counted. Now ironically, instead of
scrapping protections for sage grouse, the state is citing the bird to
say local objections are being left out of the discourse.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody knows where the migration corridors are,” said Lander County
land use planner Pam Harrington, who previously worked for conservation
group Trout Unlimited. “We’re not unsupportive of [solar energy] in our
county. We want to see growth. But we want to see smart growth.”
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think the mining and agriculture concerns here are scant
compared to the very real tax issue. We see transmission lines or
renewables projects face scrutiny when the power itself doesn’t go to
the people directly impacted. The same could easily be true here with
taxes. Notably, the hardrock mining industry – also blooming in Nevada –
pays state royalties but no federal payments for the resources it
collects in the state.
</p>
<p>
“The mining industry is super prominent and they have set the gold
standard around community engagement,” Gurtheau said, adding he believes
those companies are doing a much better job at engaging Nevada
communities than renewables. “That’s what our [counties] are used to.”
</p>
<p>
It’s unclear if the BLM will formally implement the solar plan before
Trump takes office. The final environmental review for BLM’s solar plan
was released at the end of the summer, but the Bureau has not issued its
official action formally opening acreage for development. The agency
said it would do this “following resolution of any remaining issues
identified” after releasing the final review.
</p>
<p>
BLM did not respond to a request for comment.

In the new Trump administration, there may be a greater focus on people
pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. But “this idea that we’re
doing this all on our own is a fiction,” argues Alissa Quart of the
Economic Hardship Reporting Project. On today’s show, we’ll discuss
economic inequality and how the economy is — or isn’t — working for
people. But first: bitcoin’s meteoric rise in value and a labor market
losing momentum.

Climate Change Will Wreck the Municipal Bond Market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Unpriced risk undermined the global economy during the financial crisis
of 2008. Today,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/home-insurance-climate-change-housing-market/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researchers
say</u></a> unpriced physical climate risk will lead to rapid declines
in property values — and point out that this is already happening in
some Florida markets. They often compare what’s happening now to the
run-up to 2008. If the analogy holds, we will likely see disruption in
other related financial structures. In particular, as the physical
reality of climate change begins to have an effect on the attractiveness
of bonds in risky areas, the ability of local governments to raise money
to adapt to rapidly changing climate conditions may be undercut.
</p>
<p>
But comparing the effect of the 2008 unpriced risk on the municipal bond
market with the potential effects of physical climate risk shows the
suffering will likely be much greater this time. Today, there’s a
direct, rather than indirect, connection between risk and public finance
markets.
</p>
<p>
The solution? Last week, Tom Doe, CEO and founder of Municipal Market
Analytics,
<a href="https://podcast.fhnfinancial.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
cities should act now to raise as much money as possible for adaptation
before the municipal bond market starts pricing in physical climate
risk. It’s only going to get more expensive later, in his view.
</p>
<p>
During the 2008 collapse, issuers of municipal bonds suffered. According
to the
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-FCIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>final
report on the crisis</u></a>, New York State was stuck making suddenly
skyrocketing interest payments to investors — the rate went from about
3.5% to more than 14% — on $4 billion of its debt. The Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey’s interest rate went from 4.3% to 20% in a
single week. Investors who had bought municipal bonds in auctions
suffered too, because the pool of new buyers dried up very quickly in
early 2008.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the muni market has bounced back in a big way, with
professional investment managers urging tax-avoidant retail investors to
buy individual bonds through separately managed accounts rather than
through a mutual bond fund or an exchange-traded fund. Most people think
$500 billion in bond issues is likely in 2025, and the group of buyers
has a seemingly unending appetite for what they perceive to be safe and
highly liquid investments — essentially the equivalent of money market
accounts that promise federal tax-free interest payments.
</p>
<p>
But the risks now posed by physical climate change to municipal bond
issuers and investors are different and likely greater than they were in
2008. The last time around, the municipal bond market suffered because
of a domino effect — the insurance companies the issuers were using were
exposed to mortgage risk.
</p>
<p>
According to the
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-FCIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Financial
Crisis Inquiry Report</u></a>, so-called “monoline” insurers (writing
policies for single financial structures rather than a broad array of
products) had gotten into the mortgage-backed securities business,
issuing a boatload of guarantees covering more than $250 billion of
these structured products. The CEO of one of these monoline businesses,
Alan Roseman of ACA, said, “We never expected losses. … We were
providing hedges on market volatility to institutional counterparties.”
In other words, ACA believed its risk was limited because it wasn’t
directly investing in the underlying assets — that its risk was limited
to ups and downs in the market value of the mortgage-backed securities.
But when the value of huge numbers of mortgage-backed securities plunged
as the credit rating agencies woke up and repriced the risk of the
subprime mortgages buried within them, ACA and other insurers were faced
with stunning losses.
</p>
<p>
Those same insurers (MBIA, ACA, Ambac) were then substantially
downgraded. And they hadn’t been insuring only mortgage-backed
securities — they were also insuring municipal bonds and “auction rate
securities” based on those bonds, structures that allowed local
governments to borrow money at variable interest rates. When the
insurance companies froze up because of the sudden repricing of
mortgage-backed securities and their guarantees became worthless, the
auction markets froze, as well. As a result, issuers of muni bonds (and
investors in them) suffered.
</p>
<p>
In other words, in 2008, it was risk in a different financial arena —
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by insurance companies — that
slopped over and caused problems for municipal bonds. By contrast, when
it comes to physical climate change today, the municipal bond market is
<em><em>directly</em></em> exposed to the central risk: Will the
communities that effectively guarantee these bonds continue to be
viable? Will these communities be insurable? Will community property
values and thus property taxes suddenly decline?
</p>
<p>
Not only that, the 2008 risk was different because it could be
eventually unwound. Property markets could get going again, as they have
in spades. This time, deterioration of the underlying asset — the
communities themselves — will likely be irreversible. Chronic flooding
will not cease on any human-relevant time scale.
</p>
<p>
Issuers are not being penalized — yet — for the physical climate risk
facing their communities, according to Tom Doe’s
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tom-doe-on-extreme-weathers-impact-on-the-municipal/id1696177158?i=1000678600217" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conversation</u></a>
with Will Compernolle on the latter’s <em><em>Simply Put</em></em>
podcast last week. “This risk is not being priced in,” Doe said.
“There’s no evidence of that right now. And in addition, the rating
agencies have
<a href="https://susanpcrawford.substack.com/p/safe-as-houses-how-muni-credit-rating" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
reflected [physical risk] in their letter scoring</u></a> of credit risk
… so there is not a ratings penalty right now. There’s not a pricing
penalty.”
</p>
<p>
Doe’s suggestion is that local governments may want to get out there and
raise as much money as they can for adaptation. “State and local
governments who are in harm’s way that need to do this can go to the
market right now, and investors are not penalizing them. The market is
not. So this is essentially cheap money if they issue [bonds] for these
projects today,” Doe said.
</p>
<p>
That’s one way of looking at the situation. Public money for adaptation
is cheap, there’s a lot of it potentially available, and it is much less
expensive to raise that money now than it will be once the credit rating
agencies and the investors start pricing in physical risk and demanding
higher interest payments in exchange for the use of their cash.
</p>
<p>
It’s a race against time: Eventually, as in 2008, the mispriced risk
will be correctly assessed. This time, unlike the last crisis, the harm
to the underlying assets will be permanent.

caps Angola visit with stop at train terminal at western port</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOBITO, ANGOLA — In the blistering midday heat at Angola’s largest
port, U.S. President Joe Biden beamed Wednesday as he shook hands, one
by one, with nine smiling hard-hatted workers. He had journeyed all the
way from Washington to meet them at the terminus of an ambitious
1,300-kilometer, U.S.-financed rail line that brings critical minerals
out of Africa’s remote interior.</p>
<p>On this December afternoon, there wasn’t much activity: The usually
bustling port of Lobito had been cleared of most workers for his visit.
A nearby black and red rail engine was still shiny and new, as were the
long chains of blue half-containers that stretched behind it.</p>
<p>Still, said a smiling Biden, this is Africa’s future.</p>
<p>“When I launched this project with our G7 partners last year, I said
our goal was to build a better future,” Biden said. “And folks, the
future is here. It’s now. The future is here.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has invested about $4 billion to refurbish the dilapidated
cross-continental Lobito Corridor track, which runs from copper-rich
Zambia, through mineral-rich Congo and then to the port. Once the full
route is completed — which officials say will happen by the end of this
decade — the system will cut a road journey of some 45 days to a rail
trip of 45 hours.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Biden announced the United States will invest $600
million more to upgrade the rail, develop the corridor and expand
agriculture. And while this project is small compared to China’s
sprawling Belt and Road Initiative, Biden emphasized that the U.S. seeks
true partnership with African nations.</p>
<p>“The United States understands that how we invest in Africa is just
as important as how much we invest in Africa,” he said, flanked by the
leaders of Angola, Congo, Zambia and the vice president of Tanzania, who
met with Biden to tout the project and plot a path forward.</p>
<p>Angolan President Joao Lourenco said: “This will be a linchpin for
the economic development that will provide the participation of small
and medium enterprises in the business value chain, mainly in
agriculture, industry and mining in order to increase trade and economic
growth of SADC [Southern Africa Development Community] region and the
Eastern African region.”</p>
<p>And from Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, whose massive,
mineral-rich nation has much to gain: “The corridor is way more than
just a transportation access,” he said. “It is a unique opportunity for
regional integration, economic transformation, and to improve the living
conditions of our fellow citizens.”</p>
<p>Analysts are quick to note that this is no charity.</p>
<p>“From the U.S. and an EU point of view, it’s like if we don’t have
access to the critical minerals for the green economy, we’ll lag behind
in terms of greening the global economy,” said E.D. Wala Chabala, an
independent economic policy and strategy consultant.</p>
<p>A top Angolan agricultural official told VOA that Angola hopes to use
this boost to one day export higher-value items duty free to the U.S.
through the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act.</p>
<p>“We are also very focused on promoting internal production,
effectively solving our need to feed and as the process allows us to
effectively evolve towards opportunities such as AGOA,” said Anderson
Jeronimo, who heads the Planning Statistics Studies Office of the
Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>An update on the World Court’s big climate case
</h3>
<p>
A representative from the United States yesterday
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/climate/paris-agreement-international-court-justice.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9NMqJdXLCT9EjuJkHPDG8bsAZS2FN98BfwI3XWvldPXrLxigkDd0H_aINHkSzSWH43oTsh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
the International Court of Justice that existing climate regimes – and
specifically the United Nations framework convention on climate change
and the Paris Agreement – are the world’s “best hope for protecting the
climate system for the benefit of present and future generations.” The
statement drew fire from small island nations and climate campaigners,
who want to see the World Court recommend that big emitters like the
U.S. be held legally responsible for the harm they do to the global
climate. But it seems the U.S. thinks existing guidelines are good
enough, even though it’s unclear how long the U.S. will remain committed
to the Paris Agreement under another Trump presidency. Other major
emitters, including China, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, have made
similar arguments as part of the landmark case. “These nations, some of
the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, have pointed to existing
treaties and commitments that have regrettably failed to motivate
substantial reductions in emissions,”

Ralph Regenvanu, special envoy for climate change and environment for
the island nation of Vanuatu. “Let me be clear: These treaties are
essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for
legal accountability.” The hearings, which started Monday, will go on
for two weeks and an opinion from the court is due next year.

earlier this year. It sold more than 6,800 Prologues, up from 4,100 in

<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The value of bitcoin has soared in the past month, with bets on an
incoming crypto-friendly presidential administration. There’s news that
president-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint a crypto-friendly chair
for the Securities and Exchange Commission: Paul Atkins. Trump has also
announced his pick to head the IRS: Missouri’s Billy Long. What should
we make of these two appointment choices? We discuss. Also: a boiling
point in the U.S. and China’s feud over semiconductor chips.

storms above $100,000 as bets on Trump fuel crypto euphoria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a
milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets
as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place
of cryptocurrencies in financial markets.</p>
<p>Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, boosted by U.S.
President-elect Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the
Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of
$103,619, a surge of about 6% on the day. It was last fetching
$102,650.</p>
<p>The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over
the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to
data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple AAPL.O alone is worth
about $3.7 trillion.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted
millionaires, a new asset class and popularized the concept of
“decentralized finance” in a volatile and often controversial period
since its creation 16 years ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than
50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory,
which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to
Congress.</p>
<p>“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and
CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of
entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fueled by
institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a
clearer regulatory path.”</p>
<p>Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make
the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a
national stockpile of bitcoin.</p>
<p>“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then
immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,”
said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets
hedge fund.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s proponents cheered Trump’s nomination of Atkins to the
SEC.</p>
<p>A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy
as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to “develop best
practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,” and the
Chamber of Digital Commerce.</p>
<p>“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep
understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain
Association CEO Kristin Smith.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with him … and ushering in – together – a
new wave of American crypto innovation.”</p>
<p>A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are
also jostling for a seat on Trump’s promised crypto advisory
council.</p>
<p>Part of the landscape</p>
<p>Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.</p>
<p>Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a
dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the
collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently
jailed.</p>
<p>Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this
year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January
and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4
billion streaming into these funds since the election.</p>
<p>“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have
been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick,
global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalized,” he said.
“If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you’ll have a
sales and trading desk… which will sit alongside FX and rates and
commodities.”</p>
<p>It is already becoming increasingly financialized, with the launch of
bitcoin futures BTCc1 in 2017 and a strong debut for options on
BlackRock’s ETF IBIT.O in November.</p>
<p>Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with
shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings MARA.O and exchange operator
Coinbase COIN.O each up around 65% in November.</p>
<p>Software firm Microstrategy MSTO.O, which has repeatedly raised funds
to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of
Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year.</p>
<p>Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty
Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and
billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of
cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>‘Who can prohibit it’</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry has been criticized for its massive
energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying
technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves
around the globe.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what
they described as a global money laundering ring which used
cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanction and launder cash
for drug traffickers.</p>
<p>Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an
investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And
its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.</p>
<p>“As time goes by it’s proving itself as part of the financial
landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment
strategy at AMP in Sydney.</p>
<p>“I find it very hard to value it … it’s anyone’s guess. But it does
have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.”</p>

urges US to ‘stop sending wrong signals’ over Taiwan after Lai-Johnson
call</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China on Thursday urged the United States to “stop sending
wrong signals” over Taiwan, after the announcement that Republican U.S.
House Speaker Mike Johnson held a call with the self-ruled island’s
President Lai Ching-te.</p>
<p>Lai is currently visiting the American territory Guam during a
Pacific tour that has angered China.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s Presidential Office confirmed to AFP Thursday that the call
had taken place, without elaborating on the discussion.</p>
<p>Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to rule
out the use of force to bring the self-governed island under its control
one day.</p>
<p>Beijing’s foreign ministry on Thursday urged Washington to “deliver
on the promises of American leaders not to support Taiwan independence,
to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs, and to stop sending
wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces.”</p>
<p>Spokesperson Lin Jian said the U.S. should “clearly recognize the
serious danger that separatist acts of Taiwan independence pose to peace
and security across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>“The Taiwan issue is the very core of China’s core interests,” he
said at the regular press briefing, adding that China would take
“resolute and effective measures” to defend its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The United States does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan
but has an arrangement to provide the island with the means to defend
itself.</p>
<p>In a separate statement on Thursday, China’s foreign ministry
announced sanctions on U.S. companies and individuals for selling arms
to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The sanctions target 13 firms engaged in the production of drones,
unmanned aerial systems, and other military products.</p>
<p>They also cover six top executives at companies including Raytheon
and BAE Systems.</p>
<p>The sanctioned companies will have their assets in China frozen and
be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives will
also be banned from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau, the
statement said.</p>

Exclusive: US House Speaker Mike Johnson speaks with Taiwan
president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — The United States has dismissed Chinese objections
to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te’s stopovers in Hawaii and Guam during a
Pacific tour, reaffirming that transits through the U.S. by Taiwan’s
democratically elected leaders are routine and consistent with
long-standing bipartisan U.S. policy.   </p>
<p>Amid China’s criticism, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and
former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi each spoke separately with Lai,
underscoring steadfast U.S. support for Taiwan.  </p>
<p>Johnson held a call Wednesday afternoon with Lai, who had recently
arrived in Guam following a visit to Taiwan’s Pacific ally, Tuvalu,
according to sources who spoke with VOA on the condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>First call</p>
<p>The call marked the first direct conversation between the House
speaker and Lai since the latter assumed office in May. Johnson had
previously congratulated Lai upon his election in January and renewed
the United States’ commitment to the security and democracy of its
Indo-Pacific partners. </p>
<p>Lai arrived in Guam on Wednesday night for a brief layover and is set
to depart Thursday afternoon for Palau, the final stop on his weeklong
Pacific tour. The trip, which began on November 30, also included stops
in Hawaii and the Marshall Islands. This marks Lai’s first overseas trip
as president.</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.</p>
<p>Bipartisan US policy</p>
<p>“Every democratically elected Taiwan president has transited the
United States,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA this week.
 </p>
<p>Guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three U.S.-China Joint
Communiques, and the Six Assurances, the spokesperson added that U.S.
policy toward Taiwan has remained consistent across administrations for
45 years.</p>
<p>Senior U.S. officials have also noted that these documents — the
foundations of Washington’s “One China” policy — contain no language
explicitly prohibiting a Taiwan president from stopping over in a U.S.
city.</p>
<p>Beijing opposition</p>
<p>Beijing, however, accused Washington of interfering in what it calls
its “internal affairs.”</p>
<p>Chinese officials said they “firmly oppose” any form of official
interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, which it considers a renegade
province.</p>
<p>“Nothing will deter China from upholding national sovereignty and
territorial integrity,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin
Jian told reporters this week.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said China’s threats over Lai’s visit are
counterproductive.</p>
<p>Garnering US support</p>
<p>Lai’s transits through Hawaii and Guam come as he seeks to garner
support from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald
Trump, who has said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection.</p>
<p>In a closed-door address at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Lai
expressed Taiwan’s commitment to deepening cooperation with the U.S. and
contributing to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader
Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco
Rubio, a prominent China hawk, has sponsored legislation supporting
high-level visits by Taiwanese officials to the U.S. and advocating
stronger U.S. policy toward Taiwan amid mounting Chinese military and
diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p>When asked by VOA if he would maintain his support for Taiwan, Rubio
said, “The president sets foreign policy, and our job at the State
[Department] will be to execute it.”   </p>
<p>Despite facing sanctions from China, Rubio expressed confidence in
finding solutions to engage with Beijing if confirmed. </p>
<p>Restrictions on Washington  </p>
<p>Under long-standing, self-imposed restrictions by the State
Department, a stopover in the capital by a sitting Taiwanese president
is considered highly provocative to Beijing.</p>
<p>No sitting Taiwan president, vice president, premier or ministers of
foreign affairs and defense has visited Washington for formal meetings
while in office.</p>
<p>“I know there’s some diplomatic rules related to leaders of Taiwan
coming to the United States,” Republican Representative Andy Barr, a
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told VOA.</p>
<p>“I think we need to remove any of those impediments. I think
President Lai should be able to come to the United States, and we should
welcome him.”</p>
<p>The Communist Party-led People’s Republic of China has never governed
Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy.  </p>
<p>The U.S. has “acknowledged” but never endorsed China’s sovereignty
claim over Taiwan.</p>
<p>Washington maintains a “One China” policy distinct from Beijing’s One
China principle, taking no official position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and
not supporting Taiwan independence.</p>
<p>VOA’s congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson and Mandarin
Service reporter Yihua Lee contributed to this report.</p>

senators vow action after briefing on Chinese Salt Typhoon telecom
hacking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. government agencies held a classified briefing for
all senators on Wednesday on China’s alleged efforts known as Salt
Typhoon to burrow deep into American telecommunications companies and
steal data about U.S. calls. </p>
<p>The FBI, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, Federal
Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, the National
Security Council and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency were among the participants in the closed-door briefing,
officials told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told reporters after the briefing he was
working to draft legislation on this issue, while Senator Bob Casey said
he had “great concern” about the breach and added it may not be until
next year before Congress can address the issue. </p>
<p>Republican Senator Rick Scott expressed frustration with the
briefing. </p>
<p>“They have not told us why they didn’t catch it; what they could have
done to prevent it,” he said. </p>
<p>Chinese officials have previously described the allegations as
disinformation and said Beijing “firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks
and cyber theft in all forms.” </p>
<p>Separately, a Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a December 11
hearing on Salt Typhoon and how “security threats pose risks to our
communications networks and review best practices.” The hearing will
include Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan. </p>
<p>There is growing concern about the size and scope of the reported
Chinese hacking into U.S. telecommunications networks and questions
about when companies and the government can assure Americans over the
matter. </p>
<p>A U.S. official told reporters a large number of Americans’ metadata
has been stolen in the sweeping cyber espionage campaign, adding that
dozens of companies across the world had been hit by the hackers,
including at least eight telecommunications and telecom infrastructure
firms in the United States. </p>
<p>“The extent and depth and breadth of Chinese hacking is absolutely
mind-boggling — that we would permit as much as has happened in just the
last year is terrifying,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. </p>
<p>Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Wednesday he will work “with
national security agencies through the transition and next year in an
effort to root out the threat and secure our networks.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials have previously alleged the hackers targeted Verizon,
AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Lumen and others and stole phone audio intercepts
along with a large tranche of call record data. </p>
<p>T-Mobile said it does not believe hackers got access to its customer
information. Lumen said there is no evidence customer data was accessed
on its network. </p>
<p>Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey, Lumen CEO Kate
Johnson and T-Mobile took part in a November 22 White House meeting on
the issue.  </p>
<p>Verizon said “several weeks ago, we became aware that a highly
sophisticated, nation-state actor accessed several of the nation’s
telecom company networks, including Verizon” adding the incident was
focused on a very small subset of individuals in government and
politics. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T said it is “working in close coordination with federal law
enforcement, industry peers and cyber security experts to identify and
remediate any impact on our networks.” </p>
<p>CISA told reporters on Tuesday that it could not offer a timetable
for ridding America’s telecom networks of all hackers. </p>
<p>“It would be impossible for us to predict when we’ll have full
eviction,” CISA official Jeff Greene said.</p>

id="pete-hegseth-trumps-pick-to-lead-pentagon-says-he-is-fighting-on-for-confirmation">Pete
Hegseth, Trump’s pick to lead Pentagon, says he is fighting on for
confirmation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pete Hegseth, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s embattled choice to
lead the Defense Department, said Wednesday he is continuing his fight
to win Senate confirmation, even as news accounts say Trump is
considering whether to name someone else.</p>
<p>The nomination of Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated military officer
and Fox News talk show host, to lead the Pentagon has run into headwinds
in the Senate, which must confirm his nomination, as he faces questions
about allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking.</p>
<p>With no history of managing a large organization, either in the
military or corporate world, Hegseth is an unconventional choice to
oversee the country’s nearly 2.9 million active duty and reserve troops
across the world, along with another 700,000 civilians who work for the
military.</p>
<p>But Hegseth said he is not backing down, even as several U.S. news
accounts say Trump is reconsidering the appointment, possibly in favor
of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a former
military officer. DeSantis is a Navy veteran who unsuccessfully ran
against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before
withdrawing in January.</p>
<p>On social media platform X, Hegseth said, “I’m doing this for the
warfighters, not the warmongers. The Left is afraid of disrupters and
change agents. They are afraid of <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> — and me. So they
smear w/ fake, anonymous sources &amp; BS stories. They don’t want
truth. Our warriors never back down, &amp; neither will I.”</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, as he headed to meet with senators faced with
deciding whether to confirm him, Hegseth told reporters, “I spoke to the
president-elect this morning. He said, ‘Keep going, keep fighting. I’m
behind you all the way.’ … Why would I back down?”</p>
<p>NBC News reported Tuesday that 10 current and former Fox employees
told the network that Hegseth’s co-workers at Fox had been concerned by
his alcohol consumption, including occasions when he showed up at work
smelling of alcohol and talking about being hung over. Other news
accounts have raised questions about Hegseth’s partying and drinking at
veterans’ groups he oversaw.</p>
<p>Hegseth is also facing questions about a 2017 encounter at a
Republican women’s conference in California where a woman accused him of
sexually assaulting her after extensive drinking. He told police
investigating her claim that the encounter was consensual, and no
charges were filed.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, however, Hegseth paid the woman an
undisclosed amount to keep her from filing a lawsuit that Hegseth feared
would get him fired from his weekend show at Fox.</p>
<p>One Trump ally, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, on Tuesday
called the allegations against Hegseth “very disturbing,” and he said
that some of them are “going to be difficult” for some senators
considering his nomination.</p>
<p>Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the incoming Senate
majority leader, said Hegseth must address the troubling allegations he
faces.</p>
<p>“There are hard questions being raised, so he’ll have to answer
those,” Thune said.</p>
<p>Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate in January,
meaning Hegseth can lose the support of no more than three Republicans,
with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, if
necessary. Hegseth is unlikely to win any Democratic support.</p>
<p>In other presidential transition news, Trump on Wednesday named Peter
Navarro, a former trade adviser in his first White House term, to be his
senior counsel for trade and manufacturing when he is inaugurated
January 20.</p>
<p>Navarro served four months in prison earlier this year for defying a
congressional subpoena investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the
U.S. Capitol as about 2,000 Trump supporters tried to block lawmakers
from certifying that Trump had lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>Trump described Navarro, 75, as “a man who was treated horribly by
the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.”</p>
<p>The president-elect also named Daniel Driscoll, a former soldier and
Iraq war veteran, as secretary of the Army. Additionally, Trump plans to
nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which oversees securities markets and
investments.</p>
<p>Trump also announced Wednesday his choice of former Missouri
Congressman Billy Long to lead the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>According to the Missouri Independent newspaper’s website, Long
represented his Southwest Missouri district in Congress for six terms.
The retired auctioneer and conservative talk radio host first ran in
2010.</p>
<p>Long attended the University of Missouri though he does not have a
college degree, according to Ballotpedia.org.</p>
<p>“Since leaving Congress, Billy has worked as a Business and Tax
advisor, helping Small Businesses navigate the complexities of complying
with the IRS Rules and Regulations. … He is an extremely hard worker,
and respected by all, especially by those who know him in Congress,”
Trump said of Long in his announcement on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump has also tapped former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler to run the
Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>“Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce
red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow,
innovate, and thrive,” Trump said in a statement Wednesday. “She will
focus on ensuring that SBA is accountable to Taxpayers by cracking down
on waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach.”</p>
<p>The New York Times describes Loeffler as a “top donor” to Trump’s
2024 presidential campaign. The newspaper’s website said she has “little
experience in public service.” She received an appointment to the U.S.
Senate in 2020 by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. She was defeated in a
special election in January 2021 by the Rev. Raphael Warnock.</p>
<p>Loeffler, who is working on Trump’s inauguration committee, also
supported Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>
<p>Trump also announced his choice of Fiserv CEO Frank Bisignano to head
the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>So far, two of Trump’s choices for top-level jobs — Chad Chronister
to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and Matt Gaetz for U.S.
attorney general — have dropped out.</p>

Finalizes Another IRA Tax Credit Before You Know What</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE0MTk5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzEzMTc1OX0.ZpXs7cVVTRb9LtH1fGZAy1sPfJ0-GQCm39SvYhC_uxs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Treasury Department
is dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s on the tax rules that form the
heart of the Inflation Reduction Act and its climate strategy. Today,
Treasury has released final rules for the Section 48 Investment Tax
Credit, which gives project owners (and/or their tax equity partners)
30% back on their investments in clean energy production.
</p>
<p>
The IRA-amended investment tax credit, plus its sibling production tax
credit, are updates and expansion on tax policies that have been in
place for decades supporting largely the solar and wind industries. To
be clear, today’s announcement does <em><em>not</em></em> contain the
final rules for the so-called
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>technology-neutral</u></a>”
clean electricity tax credits established under the IRA, which will
supercede the existing investment and production tax credits beginning
next year and for which
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>all
non-carbon emitting sources of energy</u></a> can qualify.
</p>
<p>
But projects that begin construction this year can still qualify for and
claim the legacy credits, which were expanded by the Inflation Reduction
Act to include things like standalone energy storage. Projects that go
into service this year would only be eligible for the legacy credits,
while a project that begins construction this year and goes into service
next year or later could choose between the legacy credits or the tech
neutral credits, but not both.
</p>
<p>
The proposed rules,
<a href="https://www.projectfinance.law/publications/2023/november/new-investment-tax-credit-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>released
in November of last year</u></a>, set off a flurry of campaigning and
lobbying by the industry, seeking adjustments to their favor. The final
regulations largely hew to the earlier release, although they do include
clarifications on what precise aspects of an energy system qualify for
the credits. Under the final rules, for instance the “upgrading
equipment” necessary for “cleaning and conditioning” biogas —
i.e. removing other gases to make it a pure gas stream — can qualify for
the credit.
</p>
<p>
Going into the end of the year, the major items left on the Treasury
Department’s agenda were the tech neutral tax credits, rules for the
advanced manufacturing tax credit, and rules for credits related to the
production of clean hydrogen; advanced manufacturing tax credit rules
came
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>out
in late October</u></a>. While the Biden Treasury is doing its best to
get rules out the door before Donald Trump’s inauguration, the fate of
all clean energy tax credits is

American students found to miss school at higher rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN CARLOS, ARIZONA — After missing 40 days of school last year,
Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The
importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school — and at
home. </p>
<p>When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the
teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his
clothes. But Tommy’s grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of
his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his
friends carefully and to behave in class. </p>
<p>He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told
him. </p>
<p>“I didn’t have everything,” said Betom, an enrolled member of the San
Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe’s reservation in
southeastern Arizona. “You have everything. You have running water in
the house, bathrooms and a running car.” </p>
<p>A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy’s family to
address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos
Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during
the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school
year. </p>
<p>Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state
is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for
Native American students — a disparity that existed before the pandemic
and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated
Press. </p>
<p>Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year,
half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native
students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state
average. </p>
<p>Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen
connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of
illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to
the U.S. government’s campaign to break up Native American culture,
language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding
schools. </p>
<p>History “may cause them to not see the investment in a public school
education as a good use of their time,” said Dallas Pettigrew, director
of Oklahoma University’s Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of
the Cherokee Nation. </p>
<p>On-site health, trauma care </p>
<p>The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that
partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to
students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success
coaches — school employees who help families address challenges that
keep students from coming to school. </p>
<p>Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half
of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students
come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent
Deborah Dennison said. </p>
<p>Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable
living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San
Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache
tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect
with students, he said. </p>
<p>“You feel better, you do better,” Jones said. “That’s our job here in
the care center is to help the students feel better.” </p>
<p>In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the
district fell from 76% to 59% — an improvement Dennison attributes
partly to efforts to address their communities’ needs. </p>
<p>“All these connections with the community and the tribe are what’s
making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them
rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been
for over a century of education in Indian Country,” said Dennison, a
member of the Navajo Nation. </p>
<p>In three states — Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota — the majority of
Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In
some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly
for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native
students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023. </p>
<p>AP’s analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts.
Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools. </p>
<p>Schools close on days of Native ceremonial gatherings </p>
<p>At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native
American pueblos along New Mexico’s Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds
of students are chronically absent. </p>
<p>The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts
on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return.
Excused absences for sick days are still piling up — in some cases,
Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about
falling behind academically. </p>
<p>Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and
emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out
to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings
with those students’ parents. </p>
<p>“There’s illness. There’s trauma,” Montoya said. “A lot of our
grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can
be working.” </p>
<p>About 95% of Algodones’ students are Native American, and the school
strives to affirm their identity. It doesn’t open on four days set aside
for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for
absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby
pueblos. </p>
<p>For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers
classes in the family’s native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at
home but says that’s not always enough to instill fluency. </p>
<p>Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were
discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start
educational program — a system that now promotes native language
preservation — and they struggled academically. </p>
<p>“It was sad to see with my own eyes,” said Tenorio, a single parent
and administrative assistant who has used the school’s food bank. “In
Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really
there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.” </p>
<p>Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school
day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to
be a policeman. </p>
<p>“He’s inspired,” Tenorio said. “He tells me every day what he
learns.” </p>
<p>Home visits </p>
<p>In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said
better communication with families, including Tommy Betom’s, has helped
improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he
said, that often means home visits. </p>
<p>Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate’s
student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10,
missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just
two days by the same time this year. </p>
<p>“The kids always want to go — they are anxious to go to school now.
And Brylee is much more excited,” said Curtis, who takes care of her
grandchildren. </p>
<p>Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an
option. </p>
<p>The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of
school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its
efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially
at the high school, she said. </p>
<p>“Education was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,”
she said. “We work to decolonize our school system.”   </p>
<p>This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among
Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news
outlet that covers Indigenous issues.</p>

<h2 id="canadians-push-back-on-trumps-tariff-threat">Canadians push back
on Trump’s tariff threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Vancouver, British Columbia — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat
to introduce 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada is
getting reaction, not surprisingly, in both countries.</p>
<p>The threat of tariffs on everything coming across the world’s largest
undefended border from Canada to the United States got attention but has
not been met with overwhelming surprise.</p>
<p>University of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said
it is a return to Trump World, where the world is responding to his
social media posts. He said Canadian authorities should know from the
previous Trump administration to take the threat seriously but not
literally.</p>
<p>“But the other piece of it is then to find ways to respond to,
address what Mr. Trump is saying, but to do so without simply giving in
and waving the white flag,” Prest said. “That the need to push back in
creative ways is, I think, an important lesson, as well.”</p>
<p>Trump says he will impose this tariff if Canada and Mexico do not get
control of illegal migrants and fentanyl distribution.</p>
<p>According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, just
under 20 kilograms of fentanyl was seized along the Canada-U.S. border
in the last fiscal year. During the same time, 9,500 kilograms were
seized along the U.S.-Mexican border.</p>
<p>Canada is the largest trading partner of the United States, with
goods valued at an average $2.7 billion crossing the almost
9,000-kilometer-long border every day in 2023.</p>
<p>Canada is the United States of America’s largest source of foreign
oil. Prest said the proposed tariffs on that would increase costs on
everything, and this needs to be effectively communicated.</p>
<p>“[Make] it clear that there are interests that unite the two
countries and that they’re far greater than whatever divides us,” Prest
said. “Those messages need to be put forward in a variety of
formats.”</p>
<p>Andreas Schotter, a professor of global strategy at the Ivey Business
School at Western University in Ontario, said the proposed tariffs will
hurt both countries. But, he added, they can be avoided if Canada makes
serious commitments with tangible results.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is suggesting it could
deploy more law enforcement resources to the border, including
personnel, helicopters and unmanned drones.</p>
<p>Schotter’s concern is that the most recent demand from Trump may go
beyond fentanyl and migration and lead to the cancellation of the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term
to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>“I think he will not wait for 2026 to reopen USMCA,” Schotter said.
“I think he will say, ‘Well, you can talk to me now, or I will not talk
to you in 2026, and I just cancel it, right?’ So I think he will not
respect even the agreed upon timelines, necessarily. And this is
worrying me.”</p>
<p>This past weekend, Trudeau, his chief of staff Katie Telford and
Minster of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc flew from Ottawa to Trump’s
home in Florida for direct talks.</p>
<p>LeBlanc has told multiple media outlets the dinner meeting went well,
with Trump emphasizing the prevalence of fentanyl as a main concern.
Also discussed was the large trade deficit between United States and
Canada. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this amounted to
$53.5 billion in 2022.</p>
<p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce predicts that if the threatened
tariffs are put in place, they would shrink Canada’s Gross Domestic
Product by 2.6%, and the GDP of the United States by 1.6%.</p>

sanctions target illicit digital finance network, US says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a fresh round of
Russia-related sanctions on Wednesday, taking aim at what it called an
illicit finance network that allowed Russian elites to leverage digital
assets to avoid sanctions.</p>
<p>In a statement, the U.S. Department of Treasury said it was targeting
five people and four entities tied to “a sprawling international network
of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions
circumvention” known as the TGR Group.</p>
<p>The targets also include an entity based in Wyoming that is owned in
part by a sanctioned individual, the department said.</p>
<p>“Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital
assets — in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins — to evade U.S.
and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the
Kremlin,” Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial
Intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement.</p>
<p>The international network actions include “the laundering of funds
associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service
to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the
value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a
prepaid credit card service; and obfuscating the source of funds to
allow high-net-worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the
United Kingdom,” according to the department’s statement.</p>
<p>Such sanctions generally prohibit any U.S. persons or entities from
conducting any transactions with sanctioned targets and freeze any
U.S.-held assets belonging to the sanctioned people or entities.</p>
<p>Among those targeted in Wednesday’s action are George Rossi, a
Russian-born Ukrainian national born in Russia that the Treasury
Department said is believed to control the TGR Group, and Rossi’s direct
subordinate, Russian national Elena Chirkinyan, among others.</p>

id="unitedhealthcare-ceo-shot-dead-outside-new-york-hotel">UnitedHealthcare
CEO shot dead outside New York hotel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth’s UNH.N insurance
unit, was fatally shot on Wednesday morning outside a midtown Manhattan
hotel just before a scheduled company investor conference, the company
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred around 6:40 a.m. local time outside the Hilton
on Sixth Avenue, where the meeting was taking place. Thompson was taken
to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Police were still searching for the masked suspect. A police poster
offering a reward for information about the shooting shows surveillance
stills of a man wearing a gray-colored jacket and a black sweater on a
bicycle, and another photo of the individual appearing to be pointing a
gun.</p>
<p>“Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked
with him,” UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. “We are working
closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience
and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to
Brian’s family and all who were close to him.”</p>
<p>The attack appeared to be targeted, the New York Times reported,
citing police. Investigators believe the gunman had been waiting in the
area for some time before Thompson’s arrival ahead of an investors
meeting, CNN reported.</p>
<p>The shooting happened not long before a scheduled UnitedHealth
investor conference in Manhattan, which was cut short at about 9 a.m.,
roughly an hour after it kicked off as news of the shooting trickled
out.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare is the largest U.S. health insurer, providing
benefits to tens of millions of Americans, who pay more for healthcare
than in any other country.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth Group Chief Executive Andrew Witty took the stage at the
Hilton about one hour after the event started to announce the
cancellation.</p>
<p>“We’re dealing with a very serious medical situation with one of our
team members, and as a result, I’m afraid we’re going to have to bring
to a close the event today,” he said.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Police tape blocked off the area on 54th Street outside the Hilton on
Wednesday morning, where blue plastic gloves were strewn about and
plastic cups appeared to mark the location of several bullet
casings.</p>
<p>“The police were here in seconds. It’s New York. It’s not normal here
at 7 in the morning but it’s pretty scary,” said Christian Diaz, who
said he heard the gunfire from the nearby University Club Hotel where he
works.</p>
<p>Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, where the company is based, said in a
statement that the state was sending prayers to Thompson’s family and
the United Healthcare team.</p>
<p>“This is horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and
health care community in Minnesota,” he said.</p>
<p>Thompson was named UnitedHealthcare CEO in April 2021 after working
at the company since 2004 in several departments, according to the
company’s web site.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you meet a lot of fake people in these corporate
environments, he certainly didn’t ever give me the impression of being
one of them,” said Antonio Ciaccia, CEO of healthcare research
non-profit 46brooklyn, who knew Thompson. “He was a genuinely thoughtful
and respectable guy.”</p>
<p>Consumer frustration with the U.S. healthcare system runs high and
was the driving force behind the U.S. Affordable Care Act, which created
a new type of health insurance and mandated coverage for preventative
care as well as maximum profit levels.</p>
<p>A cyberhack early in 2024 by another UnitedHealth company called
Change that provided technology for most U.S. providers affected more
than one third of Americans, who had their information stolen.</p>
<p>Millions of providers experienced disruption in their businesses that
lasted months, delaying care for patients and even salaries for
healthcare employees.</p>

The result of the last undecided U.S. House race is finally in.
Yesterday, Adam Gray was declared the winner in California’s 13th
Congressional District, flipping the seat from Republican to Democrat.
The GOP will control the House, but only by five seats. We’ll discuss
the implications. And later, we’ll hear about the ripple effects of
impeachment calls in South Korea and calls for a nationwide Chipotle
boycott coming from Lansing, Michigan.

<h2 id="transgender-rights-case-lands-at-us-supreme-court">Transgender
rights case lands at US Supreme Court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just
its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a
Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming health care for minors.</p>
<p>The justices’ decision, not expected for several months, could affect
similar laws enacted by 25 other states and a range of efforts to
regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports
competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.</p>
<p>The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a
presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to
roll back protections for transgender people.</p>
<p>There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the
arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the
court’s marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like “Champion
God’s Design” and “Kids Health Matters,” while the other side proclaimed
“Fight like a Mother for Trans Rights” and “Freedom to be
Ourselves.”</p>
<p>Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was
fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she
was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well
as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil
rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>The Biden administration and the families and health care providers
who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the
same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and
conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found
that “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish
transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.</p>
<p>The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal
protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government
to treat similarly situated people the same.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for
transgender minors, but not “across the board,” lawyers for the families
wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of
the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender
person to argue in front of the justices.</p>
<p>The administration argues there is no way to determine whether
“treatments must be withheld from any particular minor” without
considering the minor’s sex.</p>
<p>“That is sex discrimination,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar
wrote in her main court filing.</p>
<p>The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for
transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects
the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it
says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of “life-altering
gender-transition procedures.”</p>
<p>The law “draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender
transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys
and girls fall on both sides of that line,” Tennessee Attorney General
Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state’s Supreme Court brief.</p>
<p>While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton
County for support, Tennessee relies on the court’s precedent-shattering
Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion
and returned the issue to the states.</p>
<p>The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate
level of scrutiny the court should apply. It’s more than an academic
exercise.</p>
<p>The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every
law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals
court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held
that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well
within their authority.</p>
<p>The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level
of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex
discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must
identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish
it.</p>
<p>If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the
case to the appeals court to apply it.</p>
<p>Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical
organization, including the American Medical Association, the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
<p>But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland,
Norway and the United Kingdom that found the medical treatments “pose
significant risks with unproven benefits.”</p>
<p>None of those countries has adopted a ban like the one in Tennessee,
and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in
response.</p>
<p>The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee, are among those
challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that because of puberty
blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a
“16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking
at colleges.”</p>
<p>But because of Tennessee’s ban, she has to travel to another state to
receive the health care that “we and her doctors know is right for
her.”</p>

<p>
Today, we’re taking a closer look at how people are feeling in this
economy. Salaries for Americans are still increasing, but many think
their pay isn’t keeping up with inflation. The data doesn’t bear this
out. So what’s behind the disconnect? We’re also joined Alissa Quart,
executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, who
discusses Americans’ perceptions of the economy, the politics of
resentment and the importance of building a working-class media.

The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law,
is the biggest investment in clean energy in American history. It is
also in danger. In January, the Trump administration and a GOP Congress
will take over the federal government — and they have made a variety of
promises about how they’ll disrupt the law, ranging from full repeal to
a more “surgical” reform approach.

Costa</u></a>, who has worked since 2022 to implement the IRA’s climate
provisions at the White House. She joins us to discuss what went right
about the Biden administration’s rush to implement the law, why state
government capacity is holding back Democratic policy goals, and why the
federal government needs more tools to support energy innovation if it
wants to keep up with China. She also discusses how the administration
is trying to Trump-proof the law. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer,

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>What do you hear from the companies?
And I guess from your vantage point, are they beginning to do the
lobbying work you feel like they should be doing to protect the parts of
the law that are working?<br/> <br/><strong>Kristina Costa: </strong>I
think they are. You know, we hear a lot of anxiety, as you can imagine,
which is —<br/><br/><strong>Meyer: </strong>Theme of this
period.<br/><br/><strong>Costa: </strong>Theme of this period is that
there’s a lot of anxiety. And our hope is, and our belief is that they
will turn that anxiety into action, in terms of educating members of
Congress about how the law actually works and how it is underpinning the
investments that they’re making.<br/><br/>And I think, you know, to take
a step back and talk about policy for a little bit, one of the things, I
think, that is not well understood in the rhetoric about how the
different pieces of the Inflation Reduction Act actually work together
is that — you know, we have provisions that are incentivizing
investments in manufacturing, and people are generally pretty excited
about that. We also have provisions that are incentivizing adoption of
the technologies that are being manufactured. And in some cases people
are pretty excited about that, and in other cases, it has been turned
into a bit of a political cudgel. But the fact of the matter is that
those two things are pretty interdependent.<br/><br/>So, for instance,
we have what is called the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax
credit, and that is largely a per-unit tax credit that goes to
manufacturers of a specified list of clean energy components, including
batteries for electric vehicles, as well as for grid storage. And we
have seen just gangbusters investment in the EV battery space since the
passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. It has set the United States up
to be an EV battery manufacturing powerhouse. And this is, of course, an
area of importance for the clean energy transition. It is also an area
of incredible importance for U.S. energy security, given the currently
dominant market position that China plays, that China holds in the EV
battery supply chain.<br/><br/>And I think people generally think this
is pretty good. But one of the reasons besides the 45X credit just
providing a strong, straight-up incentive to invest in the United States
and make these things in the United States is that the much-maligned 30D
new clean vehicle tax credit that provides a subsidy to individuals to
buy electric vehicles that are made in the United States has a bunch of
pretty stringent requirements about the sourcing of batteries and of
critical minerals contained within those vehicles in order to be
eligible for the tax credit. And so you have both incentives to
manufacture, but you also basically have incentives to provide support
for the offtake of what those manufacturers are actually producing.<br/>
<br/>Those two things go hand in hand, and I don’t think that is well
understood in the political rhetoric.<br/>

<h2 id="a-standardized-test-for-carbon-removal">A Standardized Test for
Carbon Removal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzMjQyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODcwMjYxMn0.d89C52XrVopKq04BVwQEBROnlfK4oXrRQBExce2u4-E/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the wake of a wave of scandals in the carbon credit market, a
boatload of brokers arrived to mediate between buyers and sellers and
improve the integrity of carbon claims. In came the
<a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consulting
firms</u></a> staffed by scientists to advise companies on which credits
to buy,
<a href="https://bezerocarbon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ratings
agencies</u></a> to assess individual carbon projects, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/isometric-carbon-credits" target="_self"><u>carbon
credit registries</u></a> with new business models that promised to be
more scrupulous than those that came before.
</p>
<p>
But to Peter Minor, none of these players is getting at the root issue.
So Minor, an alum of the carbon removal advocacy group Carbon180, is
launching his own company, Absolute Climate, to solve what he sees as
the two biggest problems in the carbon credit market: inconsistent
accounting and conflicts of interest.
</p>
<p>
“If we don’t fix these things, the carbon removal industry may never get
to the trust and adoption that it’s going to need to get to enough scale
to actually reduce harms,” Minor told me.
</p>
<p>
Absolute Climate’s solution is a new standard, or set of rules, for
accounting for the climate benefits of carbon removal projects that
would ensure carbon credits from different projects are comparable on an
apples to apples basis. That is, as long as it’s widely accepted by a
market that’s fraught with divisions.
</p>
<p>
To date, the registries — the businesses that certify and sell carbon
credits — have been the ones to create and oversee accounting standards.
But the registries have an incentive to set permissive requirements,
Minor said, because the more credits they certify, the more they can
sell. This arrangement has resulted in standards that all use slightly
different criteria to account for how much carbon has been removed.
These differences show up not just across registries, but also within
registries across different types of projects.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an illustrative example: Climeworks is a company that builds
industrial-scale plants to suck carbon out of the air, compress it, and
inject it underground. Under the carbon removal registry Puro’s
standard, Climeworks must take into account the emissions related to
clearing the land, building the plant, powering it, transporting the
captured carbon, and injecting it before coming up with the net total
tons of carbon the plant has removed and the number of credits the
company can sell.
</p>
<p>
Compare that to Red Trail Energy, which owned a corn ethanol refinery
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-is-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>recently
began capturing carbon</u></a> emitted from the facility’s fermentation
tank and injecting it underground. Corn absorbs carbon from the
atmosphere as it grows, and Red Trail puts away some of that carbon
permanently. But to calculate how many carbon removal credits Red Trail
can sell based on this project, Puro does not require the company to
account for the emissions associated with growing the corn, transporting
it to the plant, or heating it up using a natural gas boiler. Nor does
it require measurement of the emissions released when the ethanol is
burned in a vehicle. If it did, all those emissions would exceed the
amount of carbon Red Trail is storing.
</p>
<p>
On the Puro registry, Climeworks’ credits and Red Trail’s credits are
identical, both advertised as carbon removal. But to Minor, the credits
are fundamentally different — one is a truly net-negative process, the
other reduces emissions to the atmosphere from an existing source. Once
the world has cut carbon nearly to zero, only the first project could
provide a counterweight to any residual emissions and help halt or even
reverse warming. Minor worries that if both are called carbon removal,
the difference won’t be clear until it’s too late.
</p>
<p>
“We might get to the point where we’ve scaled up the infrastructure and
the political economies around certain projects because they were
cheaper or more efficient in our minds, but actually it’s just that they
weren’t net-negative,” he said. “So we may put ourselves in a position
where we can’t actually meet our climate goals.”
</p>
<p>
Minor is not alone in this concern. Several recent peer-reviewed papers
have
<a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wene.540" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified
this as a pervasive issue</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224004226" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed
ideas for how to solve it</u></a>. “Big picture, we want net flux of
carbon out of the atmosphere into storage,” Anu Khan, founder of the
non-profit
<a href="https://www.carbonremovalstandards.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon
Removal Standards Initiative</u></a>, told me. “We want to set rules
that motivate this and allow us to add it up over time.”
</p>
<p>
Absolute Climate’s solution is based on a framework developed by
scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Minor described
it as a single standard that verifiers can apply in exactly the same way
to every method of carbon removal and determine whether a given project
is net-negative or not. Each type of carbon removal, like enhanced rock
weathering or direct air capture, will still require individualized
rules for how it should conduct physical measurements, he said. But the
project scope — the question of <em><em>what</em></em> to measure — will
be consistent.
</p>
<p>
In practice this doesn’t seem like a major paradigm shift. It requires
project developers to identify all the activities associated with their
project that either release or store carbon, measure each one, and add
them together to get the net result. The main difference is that they
can’t selectively ignore certain emissions in the calculation if, for
example, those emissions are related to a co-product like ethanol.
</p>
<p>
To meet Absolute’s standard, a project must also be able to store carbon
for 1,000 years, similar to the amount of time carbon emissions stay in
the atmosphere. That’s in contrast to most standards, which have
different requirements depending on the project type. For example,
reforestation and soil carbon storage projects typically only have to
store carbon for 100 years, while any project injecting carbon
underground has to promise 1,000 years.
</p>
<p>
Any carbon credit registry can adopt the standard, and the company will
earn a fee for each project certified under it, rather than for the
number of credits certified. One registry, called Evident, which sells
renewable energy credits, has already agreed to use it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s hard to imagine other registries that have invested significant
time into developing standards — and certified credits using them —
throwing those out anytime soon. When I wrote about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-is-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>the
questions raised by the Red Trail Energy project</u></a> earlier this
year, Puro defended its rules. Marianne Tikkanen, Puro’s co-founder and
head of standards, said the point of carbon credits is to pay for an
intervention that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. In this case, that
meant it was appropriate to isolate the carbon capture and storage part
of the project when it came to certifying credits, she said.
</p>
<p>
Adding yet another layer between buyers and sellers could also increase
costs. “There are market pressures that drive towards vertical
integration of registries that do everything,” Khan told me. “Cost
savings are a really big deal. Companies want to buy credits at the
lowest cost that is good enough for the type of claim that they want to
make.”
</p>
<p>
Absolute will face competition, both in the literal market and in the
marketplace of ideas, from Isometric, a registry
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/isometric-carbon-credits" target="_self"><u>my
colleague Katie Brigham wrote about</u></a> earlier this year. Isometric
has tried to address the conflict of interest problem by charging fees
to buyers — not sellers — for verifying carbon credits.
</p>
<p>
In setting such a high bar, Absolute also risks having a chilling effect
on the carbon removal industry by blocking promising projects that are
working through yet-unproven science or have other early-stage growing
pains from a key source of funding. As a solution, Absolute plans to
designate some projects as part of an “innovative class.” One example
Minor gave me is a new direct air capture company that can’t procure
enough renewable energy to power its pilot plant and has to run using
dirty power. “We can allow them to take those shortcuts where it makes
sense, assuming their buyers or the governments that they’re delivering
to are okay with that, but we’re going to be transparent about it,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
In short, there will be two classes of credits under the Absolute
standard — those that really, definitely, represent carbon removed from
the atmosphere, and those that may or may not but support projects that
maybe one day could.
</p>
<p>
This is all a lot to make sense of, and it’s possible Absolute could
introduce <em><em>more</em></em> confusion into the market with all
these new terms and definitions.
</p>
<p>
“This is most valuable, I think, for those people who care about whether
or not what they are investing in can play that future role of being
actual carbon removal,” Corinne Scown, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory whose work influenced the Absolute standard, told
me. But for those who just want to fund projects that help fight climate
change, the distinction matters less, she said. “Mitigation is still
really valuable. We do want people to have a way to pay for that.”
</p>
<p>
While there are some companies trying to do the former, most are aiming
mainly to reduce the amount of emissions on their annual sustainability
reports. Today, these reports are voluntary and companies can use
whatever math suits them. But soon they will be required by governments
such as the European Union and the state of California, which will have
rules about how companies should calculate their carbon footprints.
Depending on how those rules are implemented, the distinction between an
Absolute-certified carbon credit and a Puro-certified carbon credit
could matter a great deal.

<h2 id="biden-visits-us-financed-angolan-rail-hub">Biden visits
US-financed Angolan rail hub</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lobito, Angola — U.S. President Joe Biden got a firsthand look
Wednesday at a U.S.-financed rail project that weaves together his
personal love of railroads with his desire to leave a legacy in Africa
that will outlive his administration.</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor is a 1,300-kilometer rail line stretching from
copper-rich Zambia to the port of Lobito in the southwest nation of
Angola. The railway is meant to form a “strategic economic corridor”
under the Biden administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment, an initiative meant to counter China’s well-established,
sprawling Belt and Road Initiative. So far, the Biden administration
says it has committed nearly $4 billion toward the project.</p>
<p>In Angola’s capital, Luanda, on Tuesday, Biden cast the project
through his love of passenger rail. As a U.S. senator, he commuted
frequently to Washington from Wilmington, Delaware — logging nearly 340
kilometers on every trip, he said.</p>
<p>“I must tell you up front with American press here, I’m probably the
most pro-rail guy in America,” Biden said to laughter from the audience
gathered to hear him speak at the nation’s slavery museum.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he toured the Lobito Port terminal and met with Angolan
President Joao Lourenco, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix
Tshisekedi, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema and Tanzanian Vice
President Philip Mpango.</p>
<p>During a visit to a food processing factory, Biden noted the
importance of the Lobito Corridor in exporting resources, as well as
regional integration and development.</p>
<p>“We’re at one of those transition points in world history,” the U.S.
president said, noting the railway will reduce travel time across
Africa.</p>
<p>“All these projects and investments are designed to have high
impact,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden announced the United States will invest $600 million more to
upgrade the railway and further develop the Lobito Corridor.</p>
<p>“The United States understands that how we invest in Africa is just
as important as how much we invest in Africa,” he said.</p>
<p>Same or different?</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said this rail line will, by the end
of the decade, be extended to its full length, stretching from Africa’s
Indian Ocean coast to the Atlantic port. Initially, it will transport
critical minerals such as cobalt and copper from the continent’s deep
interior to the coast. When the corridor is completed, a journey that
now takes more than 40 days by road can zip across the continent in 40
hours.</p>
<p>“The premise behind the corridor is to be able to take American
support and financial capabilities that are limited, and to focus them
more deeply in one area, versus spreading that financial support and
effort across many countries,” said a senior Biden administration
official, who was not identified as is common practice when briefing
reporters.</p>
<p>VOA asked the official whether this repeats the colonial narrative of
exploiting the continent’s rich, raw resources while not adding value
and providing steady work for local populations. A burgeoning youth
population on the continent has created an urgent need for jobs, putting
strain on many African governments.</p>
<p>“I disagree with the premise that this is for raw products,” the
official replied. “Right now, only raw product is coming out. But I
think what this rail does — in order to get to higher-value products,
you need a few things. One of them is affordable and reliable and
abundant energy. So the build out of the energy system allows you to
then build the value added.”</p>
<p>Others questioned whether this U.S. effort, coming more than a decade
after China launched its ambitious Belt and Road initiative, can
compete.</p>
<p>“Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a mimic of China’s
playbook, one that tacitly acknowledges that Washington lags behind
Beijing in terms of its investments in Africa but does little to fill
the void that exists in China’s footprint,” said Chris O. Ogunmodede, an
editor, consultant and analyst of African politics, security and
international relations.</p>
<p>Wang Peng, a researcher at Renmin University of China, published on a
Chinese state thinktank, International Cooperation Center, that Western
international projects like the Lobito Corridor don’t pose a challenge
to China’s initiative because the United States “can’t provide
sufficient funds and material conditions to truly implement its
ambitious global infrastructure plan.”</p>
<p>Wang Peng also noted the U.S. could undermine it by exerting
“diplomatic pressure on host countries to force them to tear up
cooperation agreements with China; exaggerate the negative impact of the
‘Belt and Road’ project on the local ecological environment and water
resources … and hype up the so-called ‘debt trap’ issue.”</p>
<p>Mounting Chinese debt among African nations is something Biden also
mentioned indirectly in his remarks Tuesday, in seeking to cast the U.S.
as a reliable partner.</p>
<p>“We’ve also pushed to ensure that developing nations do not have to
choose between paying down unsustainable debt and being able to invest
in their own people,” he said.</p>
<p>But, as Biden also said, his time is running short as he prepares to
leave office. Analysts say this project may be well-received by
President-elect Donald Trump, as it suits his more transactional
approach to the continent and appeals to one of Trump’s biggest backers,
billionaire Elon Musk.</p>
<p>“The money has been earmarked already after all,” said James Murphy
of Clark University in Massachusetts. “Continuing the Lobito project is
a smart idea — Trump does not have to own it except in the sense that it
gives him a talking point about our strategic/resource-driven interests
in Africa, particularly as a strategy to acquire minerals essential for
Elon’s Teslas, as it were.”</p>

id="to-save-a-dying-swamp-louisiana-aims-to-restore-the-mississippi-rivers-natural-flow">To
save a dying swamp, Louisiana aims to restore the Mississippi River’s
natural flow</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GARYVILLE, La. — Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to
rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from
flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man-made
barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation’s largest forested
wetlands.</p>
<p>The 456 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New
Orleans holds Louisiana’s second-largest contiguous forest, a state
wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their
branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site,
the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators
and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory
birds.</p>
<p>Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the
swamp’s iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they’re now set to
receive a life-saving boost.</p>
<p>State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground
on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing
trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp.</p>
<p>“This is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to
what it used to be,” said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project
for the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since
2006.</p>
<p>Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden:
“The swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.”</p>
<p>The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum
of 57 cubic meters per second to flow out of a gated opening to be built
in the levee system and routed along a 9 9-kilometer diversion channel.
The project expects to revitalize around 182 square kilometers of swamp
in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy
according to the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>
<p>Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp,
river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate
the effect of subsidence — a natural phenomenon on Louisiana’s fragile
coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction — and climate change-induced
sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern
Louisiana University’s wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier
forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and
leaves, he added.</p>
<p>“All of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi
River attached to it anymore,” Stevens said. “You’ve got all this land
sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.”</p>
<p>The swamp’s diminishing health has had ripple effects on
biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at
Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the
Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow-throated
warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their
populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson
said.</p>
<p>These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo
and bald cypress foliage. When there are fewer healthy leaves for the
caterpillars to gorge on, there’s less food for the birds.</p>
<p>“That’s driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that
depend on this one forest,” Johnson said. “The whole system has
shifted.”</p>
<p>Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy
cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project’s
anticipated completion in 2028.</p>
<p>Unlike the state’s controversial $3 billion river diversion project
intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received
widespread support from elected officials and local communities.</p>
<p>The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem
Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing
settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that
devastated the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 30-kilometer
levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps
will count 36 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards
offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction,
meaning it can direct additional federal funds toward the diversion
program.</p>
<p>“For every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest”
in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of
policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem
Restoration Council.</p>
<p>And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project
highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration
going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that
levee, which means you’re going to have a better buffer for storm surge
and it’s going to allow the levees to be more effective,” said Amanda
Moore, National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Program senior director.
“This is how we need to be thinking at large about what’s possible and
how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with
nature.”</p>

<h2 id="us-conducts-self-defense-strike-in-syria">US conducts
‘self-defense’ strike in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The Pentagon says the U.S. military carried out a strike
in “self-defense” in eastern Syria on Tuesday, destroying several
weapons systems. </p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters that
the military struck three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a
T-64 tank and mortars that presented a “clear and imminent threat to
U.S. and coalition forces” in the vicinity of Military Support Site
Euphrates. </p>
<p>“The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket
launchers fired rockets in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates and mortars
were fired toward U.S. forces,” he said, adding that the strike was “not
linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other
groups.” </p>
<p>Ryder said the U.S. was “still assessing” who was operating the
weapons that were struck on Tuesday. The U.S. was aware of Syrian
military forces that operate in the area and Iranian-backed militia
groups in the area that have conducted attacks on MSS Euphrates in the
past, according to Ryder, but could not confirm who was responsible for
Tuesday’s attack. </p>
<p>U.S. forces are in Syria to help Syrian Democratic Forces prevent the
Islamic State group from resurging. </p>
<p>Last week, U.S. Central Command forces used A-10 fighter aircraft to
hit a target threatening U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates.
 </p>
<p>“Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail,” Ryder told
reporters. </p>
<p>David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies, said the U.S. should not consider pulling out
its forces from Syria in response to increased fighting across the
country, especially if it wants to keep the pressure on Islamic
State. </p>
<p>He said the terror group has already been “substantially more
effective” in areas under the control of Syrian President Bashar
Assad. </p>
<p>“We are the ones sort of keeping the cork in the bottle. ISIS would
have a lot more room for maneuver. … It doesn’t get much coverage, but
they are inflicting pain on Assad’s troops,” Adesnik said. ISIS is
another name for the Islamic State group.</p>

id="trumps-lawyers-urge-judge-to-toss-hush-money-criminal-conviction">Trump’s
lawyers urge judge to toss hush money criminal conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — President-elect Donald Trump’s lawyers formally asked a
judge Monday to throw out his hush money criminal conviction, arguing
that continuing the case would present unconstitutional “disruptions to
the institution of the Presidency.”</p>
<p>In a filing made public Tuesday, Trump’s lawyers told Manhattan Judge
Juan M. Merchan that anything short of immediate dismissal would
undermine the transition of power, as well as the “overwhelming national
mandate” granted to Trump by voters last month.</p>
<p>They also cited President Joe Biden’s recent pardon of his son,
Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges.</p>
<p>“President Biden asserted that his son was ‘selectively, and
unfairly, prosecuted,’ and ‘treated differently,’” Trump’s legal team
wrote.</p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, they claimed, had engaged in
the type of political theater “that President Biden condemned.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors will have until Dec. 9 to respond. They have said they
will fight any efforts to dismiss the case but have indicated a
willingness to delay the sentencing until after Trump’s second term ends
in 2029. In their filing Monday, Trump’s attorneys dismissed the idea of
holding off sentencing until Trump is out of office as a “ridiculous
suggestion.”</p>
<p>Following Trump’s election victory last month, Merchan halted
proceedings and indefinitely postponed his sentencing, previously
scheduled for late November, to allow the defense and prosecution to
weigh in on the future of the case. He also delayed a decision on
Trump’s prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds.</p>
<p>Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34
counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to
porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a
decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The defense filing was signed by Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil
Bove, who represented Trump during the trial and have since been
selected by the president-elect to fill senior roles at the Justice
Department.</p>
<p>Taking a swipe at Bragg and New York City, as Trump often did
throughout the trial, the filing argues that dismissal would also
benefit the public by giving him and “the numerous prosecutors assigned
to this case a renewed opportunity to put an end to deteriorating
conditions in the City and to protect its residents from violent
crime.”</p>
<p>Clearing Trump, the lawyers added, would also allow him to “to devote
all of his energy to protecting the Nation.”</p>
<p>Merchan hasn’t yet set a timetable for a decision. He could decide to
uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump
leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump’s
parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some
other option.</p>
<p>An outright dismissal of the New York case would further lift a legal
cloud that at one point carried the prospect of derailing Trump’s
political future.</p>
<p>Last week, special counsel Jack Smith told courts that he was
withdrawing both federal cases against Trump — one charging him with
hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate, the other with
scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost — citing
longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a president from
indictment while in office.</p>
<p>The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal
indictments to go to trial, resulting in a historic verdict that made
him the first former president to be convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>If the verdict stands and the case proceeds to sentencing, Trump’s
punishments would range from a fine to probation to up to four years in
prison — but it’s unlikely he’d spend any time behind bars for a
first-time conviction involving charges in the lowest tier of
felonies.</p>
<p>Because it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself
once he returns to office.</p>

id="chinese-hackers-still-lurk-in-us-telecommunications-systems">Chinese
hackers still lurk in US telecommunications systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers blamed for compromising U.S.
telecommunications infrastructure and spying on American presidential
campaigns and American officials are still entrenched in those systems,
according to senior U.S. officials who warn it could be years before the
hackers are kicked out.</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and
the FBI on Tuesday urged U.S. telecommunication companies and their
customers to take additional precautions, saying the breach might go
deeper than first thought.</p>
<p>“We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted
because we still don’t know the scope of what they’re doing,” Jeff
Greene, CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said
during a briefing with reporters.</p>
<p>“We cannot with confidence say that we know everything, nor would our
partners,” Greene said. “We’re still trying to understand.”</p>
<p>A senior FBI official who also spoke with reporters was equally
cautious.</p>
<p>“Understanding the scope of the adversary activity through our
investigations, in a situation of this magnitude, is measured in years,”
the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss
details of the breach investigation.</p>
<p>The Chinese-linked hackers have been coy, adjusting their behavior as
more information about their activities becomes public.</p>
<p>“As more comes to light they change their TTPs [tactics, techniques
and procedures] and their approach,” the official warned. “They may go
dormant for a while to lower their profile.”</p>
<p>Word of the breach emerged in October, when the Chinese-linked cyber
gang known as Salt Typhoon was linked to efforts to intercept
communications for the presidential campaigns of U.S. President-elect
Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala
Harris.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, CISA and the FBI warned that the Chinese
efforts to spy on the Trump and Harris campaigns were just the start of
“a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign” that penetrated
multiple U.S. telecommunication companies.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly denied the U.S. allegations, accusing Washington
of a smear campaign aimed at undermining Beijing.</p>
<p>“For quite some time, the US side has patched up all sorts of
disinformation about threats of ‘Chinese hackers’ to serve its own
geopolitical purposes,” Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese
Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email Tuesday regarding the latest
allegations.</p>
<p>“China firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,” Liu
said. “The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries
and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.”</p>
<p>But U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed back against Chinese
denials, and now say the Chinese breach goes even further than initially
thought, impacting telecommunication companies around the world, and
that it appears to be part of a larger Chinese government effort to
gather information about adversaries worldwide.</p>
<p>“Certainly, the way they went about it was very, very specific,” the
senior FBI official said, noting the focus on telecommunications
infrastructure and internet service providers. “But it fits into the
cyber espionage bucket to really inform global goals for the
Chinese.”</p>
<p>Neither CISA nor the FBI would say how many telecommunication
companies or how many countries have been impacted.</p>
<p>But the agencies said the Chinese efforts in the U.S. fall into three
categories: individual communications, customer call records and U.S.
law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders.</p>
<p>The focus on individual communications appears to be on intercepting
audio of phone calls and the content of text messages for a select
number of high-profile U.S. government officials, such as individuals
with the Trump and Harris campaigns.</p>
<p>The mass collection of customer call records appears to be more
random.</p>
<p>“Essentially, they stole data about where, when and whom individuals
were communicating with,” said the senior FBI official.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe that those were specifically targeted,” the
official added. “We essentially think that they were essentially swept
up by the adversary.”</p>
<p>The officials said the third category of intercepted information,
related to law enforcement requests and court orders, also appears to
have been targeted somewhat by chance.</p>
<p>Forensic analysis in two of the instances in which the Chinese
hackers accessed law enforcement information “has indicated that the
actors were on other parts of their network conducting reconnaissance
before pivoting to the [law enforcement portal] and surrounding
devices,” the FBI official said.</p>
<p>Just how far the Chinese hackers got, though, is not clear.</p>
<p>Officials said the hacked portal does include some court orders that
relate to foreign intelligence collected under the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act but declined to say whether any of that information was
taken by the China-linked hackers.</p>
<p>“We’re not prepared to answer that question today,” the senior FBI
official said.</p>
<p>For now, the FBI and CISA are urging telecommunications companies to
harden their defenses, issuing an advisory with cyber agencies in
Canada, Australia and New Zealand on steps they can take to reduce the
threat.</p>
<p>They also urged companies that think they may have been victimized to
come forward.</p>
<p>“The companies that have worked closest with us are the furthest
along and kicking the actors off their networks,” the senior FBI
official said.</p>
<p>The FBI and CISA are likewise urging consumers to be more vigilant
about security, whether that means keeping mobile phones and other
devices current with security updates, or by using encrypted platforms
for messaging and other communications.</p>
<p>“We are not seeing any novel techniques,” said CISA’s Greene, adding
that the Chinese-linked hackers seem to have simply exploited known
vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure
environment.</p>
<p>“Encryption is your friend, whether it is on text messaging or if you
have the capacity to use encrypted voice communications,” Greene said.
“Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is
encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard for them, to
detect it.”</p>

About 3.3 million people quit their jobs in October, slightly more than
in September. More quits can signal a strong labor market, but quit
rates vary across the country. In this episode, why job churn is strong
out West and falling in the Northeast. Plus: TikTok Shop did over $100
million in sales on Black Friday weekend, renters want electric vehicle
chargers and the restaurant industry struggles with debt and shifting
preferences.

choice to run DEA withdraws from consideration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to
run the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday he was withdrawing
his name from consideration. Chronister is the second person selected by
the president-elect to bow out quickly after being nominated for a
position.</p>
<p>Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County,
Florida, said in a post on X that he was backing away from the
opportunity, which he called “the honor of a lifetime.”</p>
<p>“Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important
responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw
from consideration,” Chronister wrote.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate, and Trump’s transition team did not immediately
respond to a message seeking comment.</p>
<p>Trump’s pick of Chronister for the post drew backlash from
conservatives, including for past comments he made that his sheriff’s
office was not focused on enforcing federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump’s
first choice to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a
post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a
federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to
be confirmed as the nation’s chief federal law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>The DEA post requires Senate confirmation.</p>

tariffs: Mapping the economic ripple effects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs are poised to
significantly impact countries with substantial trade volumes with the
United States. The primary nations affected include China, Mexico and
Canada, which are among the largest U.S. trading partners.</p>
<p>Trump has said that tariffs can help his administration pay for
proposed tax cuts. But these tariffs are expected to disrupt trade
flows, potentially leading to increased consumer prices in the U.S. and
prompting retaliatory measures from the affected countries. Industries
such as automotive, agriculture and technology may experience
significant impacts due to their reliance on imports and exports with
these nations.</p>

Battery Startups Think They Can Succeed Where Northvolt Failed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
By the time the Swedish battery giant Northvolt declared bankruptcy last
month, a well-funded U.S. startup, Lyten, had already swooped in to
snatch up the company’s previously
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/lyten-buys-battery-manufacturing-assets-from-beleaguered-northvolt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shuttered
Bay Area factory</u></a>. With China flooding the market with its cheap
lithium-ion tech, Lyten is betting that creating a fully domestic
battery supply chain will require alternate chemistries — like, say,
lithium-sulfur, Lyten’s recipe of choice.
</p>
<p>
Lithium-sulfur has long been a promising contender, as in theory, these
batteries can have a much higher energy density — the amount of energy
that can be stored in a given space — than traditional lithium-ion. They
also rely primarily on cheap, abundant, and easy to access materials.
“We don’t use nickel, we don’t use manganese, we don’t use cobalt, we
don’t use graphite,” Keith Norman, Lyten’s chief sustainability officer,
told me — all markets where China plays a leading role. Scaling up
standard lithium-ion battery production to meet forecasted global demand
would
<a href="https://techinformed.com/almost-400-new-mines-needed-to-meet-future-ev-battery-demand-data-finds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>require
opening nearly 400 new mines</u></a> by 2035, according to Benchmark
Mineral Intelligence. “We believe if you could snap your fingers and
change that to lithium-sulfur, that mining requirement will be reduced
somewhere between 80% and 90%,” Norman said.
</p>
<p>
Lyten’s customers, Norman said, want these batteries as soon as
possible, and acquiring Northvolt’s old 200-megawatt plant will allow
the company to begin commercial production there next year. Lyten also
recently announced plans for a
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241015561495/en/Lyten-Announces-Plans-to-Build-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Lithium-Sulfur-Battery-Gigafactory-in-Nevada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Reno-based
gigafactory</u></a>, which is scheduled to come online in 2027. Zeta
Energy, a Houston-based lithium-sulfur startup, also aims to
commercialize in 2025, and is set to announce the opening of its
100-megawatt plant in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
While both companies have dreams of enabling more efficient,
lightweight, and cost-effective electric vehicles and energy storage
systems, there are reasons why lithium-sulfur has yet to be
commercialized.
</p>
<p>
For one, sulfur is generally a poor conductor of lithium ions, and
therefore requires extra conductive material to compensate, increasing
the battery’s weight. Lithium-sulfur batteries also have notoriously
short cycle lives due to the “polysulfide shuttle effect,” which causes
the sulfur in the cathode to dissolve in the liquid electrolyte,
damaging the anode and — you guessed it — decreasing the battery’s
capacity and cycle life.
</p>
<p>
“It could be solved,” Arumugam Manthiram, an engineering professor and
battery researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. After
being involved in the initial lithium-ion battery breakthroughs of the
1980s, Manthiram said he’s seen traditional battery tech continue to
improve year after year. He thinks lithium-sulfur will follow the same
trajectory, only quicker. “Can it be solved in five years, 10 years? I’m
optimistic.” he told me. He’s currently working with Lyten on a
<a href="https://lyten.com/2024/01/30/lyten-secures-4-million-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-to-accelerate-commercialization-of-high-capacity-long-cycle-life-lithium-sulfur-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy-funded grant</u></a> to accelerate the commercialization of
lithium-sulfur batteries for use in EVs.
</p>
<p>
Zeta thinks it’s already found the ticket, though. It claims to offer
three times the energy density of traditional lithium-ion at less than
half the price. While Melissa Schilling, Zeta’s head of strategic
marketing and innovation, couldn’t reveal much about Zeta’s proprietary
cathode, she did tell me that it’s made of a sulfur-carbon polymer that
eliminates the dreaded polysulfide shuttle effect (a claim that’s been
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-energy-receives-third-party-verification-that-its-lithium-sulfur-battery-is-polysulfide-free-301811724.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>externally
verified</u></a>) <em><em>and</em></em> allows for greater electrical
conductivity. The company’s lithium-metal anode is made of
<a href="https://zetaenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/vertically-aligned-CNT-on-foil-07282022.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon
nanotubes</u></a>, a.k.a. tiny cylinders composed of carbon atoms. The
nanotubes help improve the anode’s stability, thus increasing energy
density compared with traditional graphite anodes while also preventing
the formation of dendrites, tiny projections on the anode that can cause
the battery to break down.
</p>
<p>
Zeta’s batteries can go through about eight times more charge/discharge
cycles than traditional lithium-sulfur batteries, according to the
company’s figures and Manthiram’s estimation of a typical life cycle.
Optimizing these batteries for EVs, though, will likely mean a much
shorter cycle life, which may not be on par with what lithium-ion can
do. Even so, Schilling told me, “what we’re going to beat lithium-ion on
is density and cost.” The company has raised $30 million to date, and is
in the midst of raising its Series B round. While Schilling couldn’t
reveal the names of Zeta’s initial customers, she told me that the
company is collaborating with a large automaker and heavy equipment
manufacturer. Zeta has also received the
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-energy-awarded-us-department-of-energy-grant-for-4-million-project-to-advance-higher-performing-domestic-lithium-sulfur-batteries-for-greater-range-in-evs-302057838.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>same
commercialization grant</u></a> from the DOE as Lyten.
</p>
<p>
For its part, Lyten currently provides 25% greater energy density than
top-of-the-line lithium-ion batteries, Norman told me. The company
expects that soon, it will be able to offer twice the energy density at
half the material cost. Lyten’s tech relies upon a so-called
supermaterial,
<a href="https://lyten.com/technology/3d-graphene/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three-dimensional
graphene</u></a>, which it’s developing in-house. This gets
<a href="https://lyten.com/products/lithium-sulfur-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>combined
with sulfur in the cathode</u></a> to form a more conductive and stable
composite material.
</p>
<p>
Norman said you can think of 3D graphene like a sponge with pore sizes
“perfectly designed to hold sulfur atoms.” The graphene “gives [the
sulfur] conductivity and gives it a rigid structure that doesn’t allow
it to break down as easily,” he told me, meaning the battery is less
likely to succumb to the polysulfide shuttle effect. Lyten’s anode is
also made of energy dense lithium-metal.
</p>
<p>
Lyten hasn’t publicly revealed its battery’s cycle life, however, and in
a follow-up email, Norman told me that when it comes to EV batteries,
Lyten is “not yet at the cycle life we need,” though the company is
“seeing 20-30% improvement in lithium-sulfur battery performance each
year.” For customers using lithium-sulfur for earlier-stage applications
such as drones, satellites, and two- and three-wheelers, Norman wrote
that Lyten’s current cycle life “meets or very nearly meets their
requirements.”
</p>
<p>
The company seems to have the money to work towards these improvements.

backers, and the Department of Defense is even funding a demonstration
of Lyten’s battery tech
<a href="https://lyten.com/2024/09/12/lyten-lithium-sulfur-battery-technology-chosen-to-be-demonstrated-on-the-international-space-station/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aboard
the International Space Station</u></a>, where lithium-sulfur cells will
be tested for use in everything from satellites to space suits.
</p>
<p>
Norman told me the company’s recent purchase of Northvolt’s old Bay Area
facility represents an important step in Lyten’s path to scale. The
California plant was originally designed to produce lithium-metal
batteries for Cuberg, a startup Northvolt acquired in 2021 and closed
down this summer. Like Lyten’s and Zeta’s, Cuberg’s batteries used a
pure lithium-metal anode, while its cathode was the same old
nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry that conventional lithium-ion
batteries use. With this kind of chemistry, Norman told me, it would be
“very difficult to ever compete on costs.”
</p>
<p>
One of the main ways that Northvolt ultimately went wrong, Norman and
Schilling agreed, is that it tried to scale standard lithium-ion tech
too quickly in a price-sensitive environment. “They kind of went right
to these 10, 20, 30 gigawatt-hour facilities,” Norman told me. “As they
tried to scale those, they ran into a lot of manufacturing challenges
and just the cost and time of trying to learn that on these huge
facilities kind of bit them.” Schilling told me she thinks QuantumScape,
a manufacturer of solid-state batteries for EVs, is running the same
risk.
</p>
<p>
To compete with the low-cost Chinese batteries flooding the market,
Norman told me domestic tech has to be demonstrably better — incremental
improvements in efficiency, cost, or sustainability will not be enough.
“Fundamentally, you’ve got to have a differentiated battery that
customers are really dying to get their hands on,” Norman told me. But
he knows that if Lyten successfully commercializes lithium-sulfur, other
companies and countries will quickly get into the game.
</p>
<p>
After all, major battery giants such as LG, Samsung, SK, and Panasonic
are well aware of what’s going on in the lithium-sulfur space, Manthiram
told me, even if they’ve yet to make any noise about it. “They are
quietly doing some work, R&amp;D. They don’t hype it because they have a
product already made,” Manthiram said, referring to the company’s widely
available lithium-ion batteries. “They are also watching what academic
labs are doing, what Lyten is doing, what others are doing.”

<h2 id="us-welcomes-south-korean-presidents-reversal-of-martial-law">US
welcomes South Korean president’s reversal of martial law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States expressed relief and welcomed
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s decision to rescind the order
declaring emergency martial law in accordance with the country’s
constitution. Yoon’s decision followed a unanimous vote by the National
Assembly to reject the declaration.</p>
<p>“We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved
peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Tuesday. “We reaffirm our
support for the people of Korea and the U.S.-ROK alliance based on
shared principles of democracy and the rule of law.”</p>
<p>South Korea is known officially as the Republic of Korea, or ROK.</p>
<p>The U.S. had been closely monitoring the rapidly unfolding situation
in South Korea “with grave concern” after Yoon declared emergency
martial law late Tuesday, citing the need to protect the nation from
North Korea’s communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements.</p>
<p>Just hours later, Yoon announced he would lift the martial law decree
after South Korean lawmakers voted to reject his decision and protesters
gathered outside parliament.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, U.S. officials are actively engaging with their
South Korean counterparts in Washington and Seoul, gathering facts and
assessing the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>“We were not notified of President Yoon’s announcement in advance,”
State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during
a briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I have no threat assessment analysis to offer as it relates to the
DPRK in the context of this,” Patel told VOA when asked if the U.S. had
received specific threats in the past 24 hours from North Korea,
officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul announced the cancellation of
routine consular appointments for American citizens and visa applicants
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The embassy also urged U.S. citizens in South Korea to monitor local
news, follow official guidance, avoid demonstration areas, and exercise
caution near large gatherings or protests, as even peaceful
demonstrations can escalate unexpectedly.  </p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said earlier on Tuesday
that the U.S. was watching developments in South Korea “with grave
concern” and expressed every hope and expectation that “any political
disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of
law.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan and Blinken have been briefed on the developments and are being
kept updated as the situation unfolds, according to Campbell.</p>
<p>Biden was briefed on the latest developments in South Korea as his
motorcade was en route to his hotel in Luanda, the capital of Angola.
Biden is on his first trip to Africa as president.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told
reporters during a news briefing that he did not believe the martial law
declaration would significantly affect the approximately 28,500 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>Ryder added that the militaries of the two allies are “in contact,”
but that there has been no request for assistance from Seoul. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns about the fluid
developments in South Korea.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was “very frightening to see
a key democratic ally in crisis.”</p>
<p>Murphy told VOA Mandarin that he was relieved by Yoon’s decision to
lift martial law but that the initial declaration was “a real stunning
turn of developments — stunning and dangerous.”</p>
<p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire and a member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shared those concerns,
describing the situation as “a troubling development.”</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, Yoon declared martial law during an unannounced
late-night address, vowing to eliminate what he described as
“anti-state” forces amid a power struggle with the opposition-controlled
parliament, which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North
Korea.</p>
<p>Within hours, the National Assembly voted to overturn the
declaration. Speaker Woo Won Shik announced that lawmakers “will protect
democracy with the people” and called for the immediate withdrawal of
police and military forces from the Assembly grounds.</p>

Biden gun case dismissed after President Joe Biden’s sweeping
pardon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge dismissed the gun case against Hunter
Biden on Tuesday after President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for
his son.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika closed the case the week before
Hunter Biden was to be sentenced. He could have faced up to 25 years in
prison, though as a first-time offender he likely would have gotten far
less time or avoided prison entirely.</p>
<p>Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents
that a pardon shouldn’t wipe away the case “as if it never occurred.”
Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal
form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn’t a drug user in
2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted.</p>
<p>The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing
a case filed in California after he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes.
A federal judge in Los Angeles hasn’t yet ruled in that case.</p>
<p>The president’s Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and
issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11
years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism
from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud
Biden’s legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with
prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the
agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.</p>

<h2 id="biden-visits-angola-on-first-trip-to-africa-as-president">Biden
visits Angola on first trip to Africa as president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LUANDA, ANGOLA — U.S. President Joe Biden received a warm welcome at
Angola’s pink-hued Presidential Palace Tuesday as he made his first and
almost certainly final visit to the African continent as president.</p>
<p>After a red-carpet promenade, renditions of national anthems by a
military band, an inspection of troops and a 21-gun salute, he and
Angolan President Joao Lourenco, both flanked by diplomats, got down to
work.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud to be the first American president to visit Angola,
and I’m deeply proud of everything we have done together to transform
our partnership thus far,” Biden told Lourenco. “There is so much ahead
of us, so much we can do.</p>
<p>His administration’s top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees
Angola as “exhibit A” of a collaborative relationship with
Washington.</p>
<p>His administration’s top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees
Angola as “exhibit A” of a collaborative relationship with
Washington.</p>
<p>“We, the United States, are working with Angola on a few really
important things,” said Frances Brown, senior director for African
Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking exclusively to VOA.
“One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic
of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A
third is technological and scientific cooperation.”</p>
<p>Unmentioned by Biden — publicly at least — was Angola’s poor human
rights record. Rights group Amnesty International attempted to summarize
the situation.</p>
<p>“Amnesty has repeatedly documented excessive and lethal force to
disrupt peaceful demonstrations,” Kate Hixon, advocacy director for
Africa at Amnesty International USA, told VOA via Zoom. “Not only is
lethal force used in these demonstrations, but the victims’ families do
not have recourse to access to justice. We’ve also seen several
repressive laws passed since 2020. Since 2020 it’s been illegal to
criticize the president. More recently, this year, we’ve seen two laws
approved that further threaten the rights to freedom of expression,
freedom of assembly and the media.”</p>
<p>Brown told VOA that the president always raises concerns about human
rights, privately.</p>
<p>“He never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights
issues with counterparts,” she told VOA. “And I think that’s pretty
consistent with the way he’s been throughout his long, long career in
public service.”</p>
<p>Angolan opposition groups told local media that Biden missed a “great
opportunity” to listen to civil society groups about their concerns.</p>
<p>“The Lobito rail corridor … is the only concern of Biden’s visit to
Angola,” said Ernesto Mulato of the opposition UNITA party.</p>
<p>Biden also took time to address the deep, painful blood ties between
Angola and the Americas, after a short tour of the nation’s slavery
museum. Angola was once the top source of slaves to the New World.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking at sunset in front of a glittering bay that opened
before the white-washed museum, described slavery as his nation’s
“original sin, one that haunted America and cast a long shadow ever
since.”</p>
<p>But he painted an optimistic picture — and as he spoke, skies that
had been clouded and stormy all day opened to reveal a rainbow.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t know exactly what the future will hold, I know the
future runs through Angola, through Africa,” he said. “I mean it
sincerely. I’m not kidding.”</p>
<p>Biden is set Wednesday to visit the port city of Lobito, where a new,
U.S.-financed rail line brings raw materials from Africa’s interior to
this bustling port.</p>

using such a transaction to build climate resilience, and others are
likely to follow Barbados’ lead. “In the face of the climate crisis,
this groundbreaking transaction serves as a model for vulnerable states,

finds airlines aren’t using enough of the stuff to make any meaningful
difference. The report, from Brussels-based advocacy group Transport and
Environment, ranks 77 major global airlines and airline groups on their
use of and commitment to SAF using a points scale of 0 to 100 and found
that none of them scored above 61 points, “highlighting how much
progress airlines still need to make.” Most airlines failed to get above
24 points. SAF makes up about 1% of global aviation fuel use,

It is more expensive than fossil fuel-based kerosene and there isn’t

id="china-bans-exports-to-us-of-gallium-germanium-antimony-in-response-to-chip-sanctions">China
bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip
sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Bangkok — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United
States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials
with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing
back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.  </p>
<p>The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after Washington
expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on
computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory
chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.  </p>
<p>The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect
Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports
from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering
tensions over trade and technology.  </p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.  </p>
<p>“China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the
semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese
companies, and malicious suppression of China’s technological progress,”
Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine
briefing Tuesday.  </p>
<p>“I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S.
overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control
measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction
against Chinese companies,” Lin said.  </p>
<p>Minerals sourced in China used in computer chips, cars</p>
<p>China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for
licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such
as gallium and germanium.  </p>
<p>In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict
exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from
batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of
graphite.  </p>
<p>Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is
a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants,
batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according
to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.  </p>
<p>The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of
super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials
that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many
industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective
coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also
covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items
related to such super-hard materials.  </p>
<p>China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which
are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for
mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and
military technology.  </p>
<p>China says it’s protecting itself from US trade restrictions  </p>
<p>After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a
so-called “entity list” subject to strict export controls, China’s
Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s
“rights and interests.” Nearly all of the companies affected by
Washington’s latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some
are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.  </p>
<p>Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for
national security.  </p>
<p>China’s government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to
advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but
had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s
fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other
technology.  </p>
<p>Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting
the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.  </p>
<p>The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed
using national security as a grounds for export controls, “abuse of
export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of
China.”</p>
<p> “Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and
the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic
and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain,
and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,” it said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar
statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains
and inflating costs for American companies.</p>
<p> “U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related
industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,” it said.
 </p>
<p>The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium
metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and
produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The
U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though
some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.</p>
<p>The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those
critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this
year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite
also have mostly risen.</p>

id="trump-says-he-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel">Trump
says he will ‘block’ Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he
would “block” a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon
Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts.</p>
<p>“I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being
bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,” Trump
wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>“Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S.
Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I
will block this deal from happening.”</p>
<p>Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure
sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it
says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel said after Trump’s comments that it was “determined to
protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry,
domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.”</p>
<p>“We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized
facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and
secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can
manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,”
the Japanese firm said in a statement.</p>
<p>Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected
to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while
U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office.</p>
<p>Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was “vital” for US Steel
“to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and
operated.”</p>
<p>The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.</p>
<p>In September, Biden’s administration extended their review, pushing a
conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5
presidential election.</p>
<p>A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that
“the transaction is expected to close in… calendar year 2024” pending a
U.S. national security review.</p>
<p>“Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion
will come by the end of the year,” during Biden’s time in office, vice
chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters.</p>
<p>Trump will be inaugurated on January 20.</p>
<p>Protectionist policies</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic
policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a
trade war with the world’s second largest economy, China.</p>
<p>While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block
Nippon’s takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political
battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Trump’s vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional
opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been
criticized by both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>Analysts had suggested Trump’s position could soften after the
election was over, but Monday’s statement indicated that was not the
case.</p>
<p>Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to
succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed
acquisition.</p>
<p>The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a
September arbitrators’ ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US
Steel’s labor contract obligations.</p>
<p>In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of
the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.</p>

<h2
id="white-house-biden-expected-to-issue-more-pardons-before-end-of-term">White
House: Biden expected to issue more pardons before end of term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the pardon of his son
Hunter, the White House said the president is expected to issue more
pardons and clemencies before he leaves office next month.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday
that Biden is “thinking through that process very thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a timeline for you,” Jean-Pierre said.  “As you know,
this usually happens towards the end.  And so, the president is going
through that process, thinking through that process. I’m not going to
get ahead of him. But you can expect more announcements to come.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax
offenses and could have been imprisoned for years.</p>
<p>Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a
lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life
spiraled out of control. </p>
<p>But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s
prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at
undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race
in July for another four-year term. </p>
<p>“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my
political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose
my election,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun
purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not
be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  </p>
<p>He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he
was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  </p>
<p>He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a
scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although
sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he
would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the
gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be
handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing
scheduled in Delaware for December 13. </p>
<p>The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as
well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken
part” from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024.   </p>
<p>Hunter Biden said in a statement, “I have admitted and taken
responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction –
mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and
my family for political sport.” </p>
<p>The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will
understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.”
  </p>
<p>“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell
the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth:
I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I
also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a
miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend,
there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an
abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump
supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array
of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6,
2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had
defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he
takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential
election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but
many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet
to occur. </p>
<p>Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned
Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was
convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he
intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to
France. </p>
<p>Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers,
Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief
strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among
others.  </p>
<p>Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S.
political landscape and not always predictably along political party
lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are
announced. </p>
<p>Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he
understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he
said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country.
This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and
will sadly tarnish his reputation.” </p>
<p>Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect
President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a
politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was
convicted by a jury of his peers.” </p>
<p>Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he
was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many
times he wouldn’t &amp; I believed him. Shame on me.”  </p>
<p>But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under
former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only
prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney
“would have charged this case given the underlying facts.” </p>

<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire
investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious
posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included
$2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC.</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced
he was selecting Stephens to be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of
Saint James. The Senate is required to confirm the choice.</p>
<p>“Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I

<p>Stephens is the chairman, president and CEO of Little Rock,
Arkansas-based financial services firm Stephens Inc., having taken over
the firm from his father.</p>
<p>Trump has already named many of his nominees for his Cabinet and
high-profile diplomatic posts, assembling a roster of staunch loyalists.
Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate real estate
developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner,
to serve as ambassador to France.</p>

<h2 id="trump-to-attend-notre-dame-cathedral-reopening-in-paris">Trump
to attend Notre Dame Cathedral reopening in Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump will attend the reopening
celebration for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this weekend, his first
foreign trip since the election.</p>
<p>The cathedral is set to reopen Saturday after more than five years of
reconstruction following a devastating fire in 2019. The invite-only
ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will be high-security affairs, with about
50 heads of state and government expected to attend.</p>
<p>Trump announced his trip in a post on his Truth Social site Monday
evening.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris,
France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and
Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a
devastating fire five years ago,” he wrote. “President Emmanuel Macron
has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to
its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day
for all!”</p>
<p>Trump and Macron have had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner and Trump
traveled to France several times. But the relationship soured as Trump’s
term progressed and Macron criticized him for questioning the need for
NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual-defense
pact.</p>
<p>As he ran for a second term this year, Trump often mocked Macron on
the campaign trail, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep
tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France
tried to tax American companies.</p>
<p>After Trump won another term last month, Macron rushed to win favor
with the president-elect. He was among the first global leaders to
congratulate Trump — even before The Associated Press called the race in
his favor — and beat UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the punch in
delivering a congratulatory phone call.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>,” Macron posted on
X early on Nov 6. “Ready to work together as we did for four years. With
your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and
prosperity.”</p>
<p>The reopening of Notre Dame will be an elaborate, multiday
celebration, beginning Saturday.</p>
<p>Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service
that afternoon, banging on Notre Dame’s shuttered doors with his staff
to reopen them, according to the cathedral’s website.</p>
<p>The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame’s
thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral’s lead
roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes have
been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned and returned.</p>
<p>Macron will attend and address the VIP guests.</p>
<p>After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and
Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; Paris-born cellist
Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji
and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening, according to the
show’s broadcaster, France Télévisions.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the Paris archbishop will lead an inaugural Mass
and consecration of the new altar.</p>
<p>Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the
celebration, along with priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris
diocese. The Mass will be followed by a “fraternal buffet” for the
needy.</p>

returns, facing spending, disaster relief issues ahead of change in
administrations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Democratic-led U.S. Senate returned on Monday for a
showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over
government spending, disaster relief and defense policy before
President-elect Donald Trump ushers in a new era of single-party rule
next month.</p>
<p>The main challenge for lawmakers over the next three weeks is to
avert a pre-Christmas partial government shutdown by striking a
bipartisan deal to fund federal agencies beyond Dec. 20, when a current
stopgap spending measure is due to expire.</p>
<p>The debate will include a nearly $100 billion emergency disaster
relief request from President Joe Biden for areas of the U.S. Southeast
hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other communities struck by
natural disasters.</p>
<p>Congress also faces a Jan. 1 deadline for raising the federal
government’s debt ceiling, though lawmakers and aides say that
extraordinary measures employed by the Treasury Department are likely to
postpone the expected “X” date for default well into 2025.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated on Monday that
lawmakers are negotiating a short-term stopgap funding bill known as a
continuing resolution, or CR, rather than a package of annual spending
bills that would fund the government through fiscal year 2025, which
ends on Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Schumer did not disclose details about a potential CR, which House
Speaker Mike Johnson has said would run into early next year.</p>
<p>Trump’s allies are pushing for a three-month stopgap that supporters
say would allow their party’s incoming political trifecta to dismantle
current Democratic spending initiatives and policy priorities early in
the new administration.</p>
<p>Legislative action on government funding is not expected to begin in
the House until the last of the session’s three weeks, timing that could
raise risks for Johnson’s slim 220-213 Republican majority if they opt
for a partisan measure first.</p>
<p>House Republicans failed to pass their own partisan stop-gap measure
in September and had to rely on mainly Democratic votes to narrowly
avert a shutdown weeks before the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Top lawmakers have yet to say how they intend to handle a Biden
request for emergency disaster relief.</p>
<p>The head of the Small Business Administration recently testified to
Congress that the agency’s disaster loan program for homeowners,
renters, and businesses ran out of money in October, leaving more than
60,000 loan applicants waiting for assistance.</p>
<p>Congressional aides said a disaster relief package would likely be
attached to a CR.</p>
<p>But the first objective for Congress this month is likely to be
passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, annual
legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, according to
congressional aides. Floor votes could come as early as next week,
according to aides.</p>

id="biden-seeking-additional-24b-to-support-ukraine-replenish-us-weapons-stockpiles">Biden
seeking additional $24B to support Ukraine, replenish US weapons
stockpiles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional
$24 billion to support Ukraine and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles,
two U.S. officials tell VOA, as the administration continued Monday to
push out new aid packages from the last congressionally approved funds
for Kyiv before Biden leaves office on January 20.</p>
<p>Officials who have seen the administration’s request, on condition of
anonymity to discuss its details, told VOA, that the new support would
include $16 billion to restock U.S. weapons under the Pentagon’s
presidential drawdown authority (PDA), along with $8 billion to
manufacture weapons under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
which focuses on supplying Kyiv’s long-term defense needs.</p>
<p>“This funding not only supports Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty
and degrades Russian military capabilities but also strengthens U.S.
military readiness by modernizing our weapons systems and making direct
investments in our defense industrial base,” a U.S. defense official
told VOA on Monday.</p>
<p>The Biden administration submitted aid for Ukraine in an anomaly
funding bill that also includes spending on other matters rather than in
a separate supplemental funding request.</p>
<p>“We defer to Congress to determine the most appropriate vehicle for
addressing this urgent need,” one official said.</p>
<p>News of the latest request was first reported by Politico.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are already opposing the request.</p>
<p>“Any Biden funding demands should be DOA (dead on arrival),” Senator
Mike Lee posted on X.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who will determine whether the
bill is brought to a vote in the form proposed by the White House, wrote
on X that funding decisions “are for the incoming administration, not
the outgoing lame duck President.”</p>
<p>“The American people resoundingly elected President [Donald] Trump
because he promised to bring an end to wars, not prolong them
indefinitely,” Johnson added.</p>
<p>The aid request follows vows from Biden administration officials to
seek additional aid approval from Congress for 2025. Last week, the
Biden administration also informed Congress of its intention to forgive
$4.65 billion worth of Ukrainian debt.</p>
<p>The U.S. announced Monday it was sending another military aid package
to Ukraine valued at up to $725 million, its 71st tranche of equipment
from Department of Defense inventories for Kyiv since August 2021.
Monday’s PDA included air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket
systems and artillery, and anti-tank weapons.</p>
<p>The package is the latest round of aid stemming from a $61 billion
assistance bill for Kyiv that was approved by Congress in April after
several months of delays. The Biden administration still has more than
$8 billion in funding from previous aid packages to give to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Ukrainian Minister of
Defense Rustem Umerov on Monday to discuss battlefield dynamics and U.S.
security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>During his call with Umerov, Austin condemned Russia’s recent barrage
of missiles and drones targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure,
along with its use of an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile in
Ukraine, which the Pentagon called “another escalation in Russia’s war
against Ukraine.”</p>

id="transgender-attorney-to-argue-before-supreme-court-challenging-health-care-ban-for-minors">Transgender
attorney to argue before Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for
minors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court this week wades into the
contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an
attorney with knowledge that runs deep.</p>
<p>Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue
before the nation’s highest court, representing families who say
Tennessee’s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their
children terrified about the future.</p>
<p>Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender
rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald
Trumpput his fierce opposition front and center.</p>
<p>Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case
as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.</p>
<p>“I am able to do my job because I have had this health care that
transformed and, frankly, saved my life,” he said. “I am a testament to
the fact that we live among everyone.”</p>
<p>Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was
in law school. Now 42, he’s an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence
analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving
in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at
the Supreme Court. He’s also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a
father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his
Army-veteran brother.</p>
<p>He’s also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned
gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part
of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom
usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was
elected to Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson declared
support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.</p>
<p>Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that
treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young
people and that its law protects them from making treatment decisions
prematurely.</p>
<p>“Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do
not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the
lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point
that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,” state
attorneys wrote in court filings.</p>
<p>Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served
in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the
transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The
state attorney general’s office did not make Rice available for an
interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple
of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before
he earned his law degree from the University of California,
Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee’s
law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after
Trump takes office in January. </p>
<p>Strangio said he’ll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender
youth to access health care that wasn’t available when he was young.</p>
<p>“Many of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost
years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,” he said.
Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the
American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such
care, saying it’s safe when administered properly. </p>
<p>Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young
people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk
and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.</p>
<p>“There is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to
be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves
all agree they need,” he said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.</p>

id="trumps-tariff-threats-create-division-between-canada-and-mexico-over-security-at-borders">Trump’s
tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security
at borders</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose
tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian
officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be
compared.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were
made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau.</p>
<p>“Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,”
President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S.,
Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that “the message
that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was
really understood.”</p>
<p>Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption
and “could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.”</p>
<p>Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and
Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.</p>
<p>Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border
are vastly different.</p>
<p>U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian
border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the
Mexican border. Mexico’s efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the
U.S. have been lackluster.</p>
<p>Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000
overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using
precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.</p>
<p>On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the
Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at
the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the
same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million
encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because
Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the
past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to
leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018,
and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually
the case.</p>
<p>Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S.
president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some
assurances before Trump takes office.</p>
<p>Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border
security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law
enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the
U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back
to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar
agreement.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last
week with Trump, saying he “had agreed” that Mexico wanted to focus on
intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting “he said that in his
opinion that was good.”</p>
<p>But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in
Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law
enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor.</p>
<p>“That is going to maintained,” she said.</p>

id="delaware-judge-rejects-request-to-restore-musks-56-billion-tesla-pay">Delaware
judge rejects request to restore Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, Delaware — A Delaware judge ruled Monday that Tesla CEO
Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation
package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to
reinstate it.</p>
<p>The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court
of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package
excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty
over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker.</p>
<p>Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for
comment.</p>
<p>Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a
subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for
Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its
advances — and reinstate his compensation.</p>
<p>McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to
restore Musk’s pay package.</p>
<p>“Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties
to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits
would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion.</p>
<p>She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy
statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a
“cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay.</p>
<p>“Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a
powerful punch,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Tesla shares fell 1.4% in afterhours trade, following the ruling.</p>
<p>McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the
case $345 million, well short of the $6 billion they initially
requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined
Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court
proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp;
Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s
opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed.</p>
<p>Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as
McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week.
The appeal could take a year to play out.</p>
<p>After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with
thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the
possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like
artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla.</p>
<p>Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to
challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does
not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn
the ruling from a trial.</p>
<p>McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018
board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk
deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market
value, revenue and profitability.</p>
<p>But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying
the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had
conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to
him.</p>
<p>After the January ruling, Musk criticized the judge on his social
media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of
Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear
if any companies did so.</p>
<p>The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest
compensation plan ever — an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger
than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s
2012 pay plan.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to
Equilar, a compensation consulting firm.</p>
<p>Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of
Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of
escalating operational and financial goals.</p>
<p>Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that
shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when
they voted on the package.</p>

id="us-to-block-sale-of-cutting-edge-chip-making-equipment-to-china">US
to block sale of cutting-edge, chip-making equipment to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration announced Monday that it has imposed a new
set of export controls on China, restricting the sale of cutting-edge,
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and high-bandwidth computer memory
to the communist nation.</p>
<p>The new rules ban the sale of 24 different kinds of equipment and
three different software tools, all of which are used to produce what
are known as “advanced node” semiconductors, the fastest and most
efficient chips on the market.</p>
<p>The export controls, announced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of
Industry and Security, also restrict the transfer of high-bandwidth
memory products, which advanced node semiconductors need to maximize
their performance in high-intensity applications, such as artificial
intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government added 140 companies, mostly in
China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry, to a list of
entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing
business with. In general, exporting certain technologies to companies
on the list requires a license from the federal government.</p>
<p>Blocking military development</p>
<p>The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing
China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of
concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and
advanced tools of social control.</p>
<p>“Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the
battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical,
biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and
voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political
dissidents,” the department said in a release announcing the
sanctions.</p>
<p>“This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair
[China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies
that pose a risk to our national security,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our
technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our
national security,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the
same statement. “As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new
ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and
partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading
technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national
security.”</p>
<p>China responds</p>
<p>In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington
condemned the sanctions.</p>
<p>“China strongly opposes the U.S.’ latest control measures on
semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and
non-market practice,” the embassy said.</p>
<p>The embassy accused the United States of “overstretching” the idea of
national security, abusing export control rules and “bullying.”</p>
<p>“The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,” the statement
said. “The US’ abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal
economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules
and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious
threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The
global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely
affected.”</p>
<p>The statement concluded with the promise that, “China will take
necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and
interests.”</p>
<p>Significant impact</p>
<p>Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new
sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a
world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing
semiconductors is “perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity
undertakes,” and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them
requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can
meaningfully restrict.</p>
<p>“Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and
components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the
world,” Ezell wrote. “If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to
these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply
chain that much more difficult and expensive.”</p>
<p>Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S.
manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that
China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips
anyway, which would produce the same result.</p>
<p>“The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and
like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries
in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be
recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production
in like-minded nations,” Ezell said.</p>
<p>He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major
semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute
similar policies toward China.</p>
<p>Advanced chips</p>
<p>The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called
“advanced node” chips and the equipment used to manufacture them.
Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the
transistors used in their manufacture.</p>
<p>Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three
one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual
transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip,
making them better at processing information, and more energy
efficient.</p>
<p>For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need
to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide
high-speed access to vast amounts of data.</p>

VOA Mandarin: How China may react to Trump’s likely changes in climate
policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is widely expected to withdraw from
the Paris Agreement treaty on climate change after he takes office
January 20. China also is a party to the agreement. However, Beijing has
long argued that it is not wealthy enough to be forced to provide
similar financial assistance that Washington donates to the effort. VOA
Mandarin spoke to analysts about how Beijing is likely to position
itself on climate talks going forward.  </p>

lawmakers to begin special session to protect state laws from 2nd Trump
presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Governor Gavin Newsom and state
lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin a special
session to protect the state’s progressive policies ahead of another
Trump presidency.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald
Trump, is positioning California to once again be the center of a
resistance effort against the conservative agenda. He is asking his
Democratic allies in the Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both
chambers, to approve additional funding to the attorney general’s office
to prepare for a robust legal fight against anticipated federal
challenges.</p>
<p>Democratic Assembly member Jesse Gabriel on Monday introduced
legislation to set aside $25 million for legal fees to respond to
potential attacks by the Trump administration on state policies
regarding civil rights, climate change, immigration and abortion
access.</p>
<p>“While we always hope to collaborate with our federal partners,
California will be ready to vigorously defend our interests and values
from any unlawful action by the incoming Trump Administration,” Gabriel
said in a statement.</p>
<p>California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times to
various levels of success. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to be caught flat-footed,” Newsom said at a recent
news conference.</p>
<p>Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in
America. Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and
have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation,
outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide.</p>
<p>Trump called the Democratic governor “New-scum” during a campaign
stop in Southern California and has relentlessly lambasted the
Democratic stronghold over its large number of immigrants in the U.S.
illegally, homeless population and thicket of regulations.</p>
<p>Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta
smelt, a tiny fish that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and
threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat
from wildfires. He also vowed to follow through with his campaign
promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal
status and prosecuting his political enemies.</p>
<p>Before the special session was set to begin, state lawmakers swore in
more than two dozen new members and elected leaders for the 2025
legislative session.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people also demonstrated around the Capitol on Monday to
urge the Legislature to try to stop Trump’s mass deportation plans. They
carried banners that said “Not one cent for mass deportation” and “MAGA
out of California.”</p>
<p>“With the results of the presidential election, we need our state
elected officials to use every tool and every resource they have
available to them to protect our immigrant Californians,” protester
Deborah Lee said.</p>
<p>State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office will protect the
state’s immigrant population, while Newsom last week unveiled a proposal
to revive a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases if the
incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people
who buy electric cars. Newsom is also considering creating a backup
disaster relief fund for the wildfire-prone state after Trump’s
threats.</p>
<p>Bonta announced legislation Monday aimed at bolstering reproductive
rights in the state, including by allowing the attorney general to seek
monetary penalties against local governments that infringe on those
rights. The proposals are part of the state’s efforts to safeguard
against threats to abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers blasted Newsom and his Democratic allies over
the special session. Representative Vince Fong, who represents the
state’s Central Valley farm belt, said California should work with the
incoming Trump administration instead.</p>
<p>“Gavin Newsom’s actions are tone-deaf to the concerns of Californians
who disapprove of the direction of our state and country,” Fong said in
a video on social media.</p>
<p>Legislators also are expected to spend the year discussing ways to
protect dozens of laws expected to be targeted by the Trump
administration, including one that has made the state a sanctuary for
people seeking abortions who live in states where such practices have
been severely limited. </p>
<p>California, the nation’s most populous state, was the first to
mandate that by 2035 all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in
California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids. The state
also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents
regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>Newsom hasn’t provided details about what actions the lawmakers will
consider but said he wanted funding in place before Trump’s inauguration
day, January 20. The state spent roughly $42 million in litigation costs
during the first Trump administration, officials said.</p>

id="cyber-monday-shoppers-expected-to-set-record-in-online-sales">Cyber
Monday shoppers expected to set record in online sales</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online
deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping
marathon with Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>Even though e-commerce is now part of many people’s regular routines
and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday — a term coined in 2005 by
the National Retail Federation — has become the biggest online shopping
day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has
created to fuel it.</p>
<p>Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to
spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That
would make it the season’s — and the year’s — biggest shopping day for
e-commerce.</p>
<p>Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and
10 p.m. Monday, per Adobe — reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent
every minute.</p>
<p>For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event
that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales
event right after midnight Pacific time Saturday. Target’s two days of
discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart
rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members Sunday afternoon
and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern
time.</p>
<p>Consumer spending for Cyber Week — the five major shopping days
between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — provides a strong indication of
how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.</p>
<p>Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following
the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods
and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales
nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a
healthy pace.</p>
<p>At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been
rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use “buy now, pay
later” plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on
holiday decor, gifts and other items.</p>
<p>Many economists have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump’s
plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United
States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing
to automobiles.</p>
<p>The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more
this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of
spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5%
to 3.5% — compared to 3.9% in 2023.</p>
<p>A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season
won’t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period.
But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging
signs for retailers.</p>
<p>Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that
discounts from Thanksgiving onward have “exceeded expectations” — and
online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40
billion mark combined.</p>
<p>U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2%
increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s also more
than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in
roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1
billion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online
shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion
in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse,
which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black
Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail
sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online
sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest
0.7%.</p>
<p>E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5
billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached
$4.6 million per minute — with top categories by volume including
clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian
company.</p>
<p>Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were
among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black
Friday, according to Adobe. “Hot products” included Lego sets, espresso
machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.</p>
<p>Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black
Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with
the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the
comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported
that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the
U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the
Midwest.</p>
<p>While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular
around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more
“experience-driven spending” in recent years, especially as the COVID-19
pandemic waned.</p>
<p>Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this
season — with consumers opening their wallets to invest or “trade up” to
more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and
sporting goods.</p>

Nine of the Federal Reserve’s 12 reserve banks are on the Mississippi

<p class="drop-caps">
Confidence in the United Nations’ ability to find cooperative solutions
to some of humanity’s biggest threats
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop29-finance" target="_self"><u>took
another walloping</u></a> this weekend when negotiators left the fifth
and final UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Busan, South Korea, with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/world-court-climate-case#:~:text=Talks%20on%20a%20global%20plastics%20treaty%20fail" target="_self"><u>no
deal</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
A planet-wide agreement on curbing plastic pollution was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-world-is-inching-slowly-and-chaotically-towards-a-new-plastics-treaty" target="_self"><u>always
going to be a big ask</u></a>. Lacking the existential drama that
undergirds the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop29-finance" target="_self"><u>annual
climate change conference</u></a>, the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee for Plastics (or “the INC-5,” as this fifth round of meetings
was seductively named) doesn’t exactly attract the same level of media
attention as its parent group. For another thing, the connection of
plastics to the cascading effects of global warming is less obvious than
that of burning fossil fuels, though by no means less severe:
Conventional plastics are made using newly extracted fossil fuels and,
as such, are a last resort profit center for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>oil
companies</u></a> facing the expiration of their social license to
operate. Plastic-related emissions are expected to outpace those of coal
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/plastics-outpace-coals-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-report-2021-10-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>within
the decade</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet despite fierce resistance from petrochemical-producing
industries and nations (more on that later), a curious champion has
emerged for a legally binding plastic treaty. Alongside the expected
environmental heavyweights in Busan last week were several business
coalitions pushing in tandem for more ambitious mandatory regulations.
</p>
<p>
There are plans to hold an “INC-5.2” next year to resolve the
outstanding differences, and mounting pressure from business interests
on the <em><em>other</em></em> side of the fight could potentially
neutralize at least some of the influence of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/climate/saudi-arabia-global-plastic-treaty.html#:~:text=Saudi%20Aramco%2C%20the%20national%20oil%20company%2C%20lists%20%E2%80%9Cincreased%20concerns%20regarding%20the%20safe%20use%20of%20chemicals%20and%20plastics%20and%20their%20potential%20impact%20on%20the%20environment%E2%80%9D%20and%20the%20%E2%80%9Crestrictive%20regulations%E2%80%9D%20those%20concerns%20may%20spur%20as%20risks%20to%20its%20business." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
countries that normally dominate such talks</u></a>. “Businesses cannot
solve the crisis alone,” Julia Cohen, the co-founder and managing
director of Plastic Pollution Coalition, told me in an emailed
statement. But they can “play a key role in shaping national positions,
driving scalable solutions, and fostering emerging markets” alongside
continued efforts to secure a global treaty.
</p>
<p>
Two main business coalitions are attempting to do just that. The first
is Champions of Change, which works with the Plastic Pollution
Coalition, Greenpeace, and Break Free From Plastic, and counts among its
350 signatories household brands like Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Blueland, and
Lush Cosmetics. The alliance is
<a href="https://championsofchange.breakfreefromplastic.org/open-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demanding</u></a>
a cap on plastic pollution, the phase-out of single-use plastics,
greater reuse targets, and a justice-focused approach that centers the
concerns of frontline communities. “Voluntary corporate pledges are no
match for an international legally binding treaty that would require
companies to move away from plastic,” Sybil Bullock, the senior oceans
campaigner at Greenpeace, told me in an email. “We have seen past
voluntary business commitments from top polluters fail time and time
again to deliver meaningful reductions in plastic pollution.”
</p>
<p>
The Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, by contrast,
<a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/latest/business-coalition-open-letter-ahead-of-inc-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stops
short</u></a> of calling for a plastic cap,
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15112024/nations-struggle-to-agree-on-global-plastics-treaty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>focusing
instead</u></a> on phasing out “avoidable plastic products” and calling
for a “global criteria for circular product design.” Specifically, the
group — convened by the World Wildlife Fund and the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation, which advocates for a circular economy — is pushing for a
“treaty based on strong global rules across the full lifecycle of
plastics and with a comprehensive financing mechanism.” Its signatories
include<em> </em>businesses that have historically been criticized for
their reliance on plastic,
<a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/endorsers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a>
Unilever, Nestle, and PepsiCo, and its softer approach has its skeptics.
</p>
<p>
“You can only downcycle plastic and currently, how plastic is recycled,
it gets contaminated by other plastics that are so toxic we cannot use
them for anything that is touching or even close to touching our food,”
KT Morelli, a campaign organizer for Breathe Free Detroit, which
successfully campaigned to shut down a local plastic incinerator, told
me. “There’s no circular answer to plastics.”
</p>
<p>
Kristen McDonald, the senior director of the plastics program at Pacific
Environment, an environmental group focused on the Pacific Rim, agreed
that “business actions alone — voluntary steps — have not worked so far,
and so I’m very skeptical that they will work in the future.” Still, she
said it’s only logical that businesses are as impatient as
environmentalists when deciding on plastic regulations. If an
international agreement isn’t reached, it creates a “really chaotic
business environment where certain plastics are restricted in some
places and not in others,” leading to trade problems and an uneven
playing field at a global level as different companies face different
local rules. As she added, a plastic treaty “actually
<em><em>stabilizes</em></em> things for companies” — unless, of course,
the company in question happens to be in the petrochemical industry.
</p>
<p>
Even the environmentalists working with the business groups agree that
there isn’t an entirely private-sector solution to the plastic crisis.
“We’re not ready to give up on the treaty process,” Erin Simon, the vice
president and head of plastic waste and business at WWF, told me over
email. But, she pointed out, after the U.S. pulled out of the Paris
Agreement in 2017, there had been a “groundswell of support from cities,
states, and other non-federal actors,” including corporations that
filled in the leadership void with “commitments that would help move the
needle toward reaching our global climate goals.”
</p>
<p>
And yet despite the limitations of the business coalitions, Morelli told
me she thinks there is still promise in the private sector. “They have
more power than the government,” she stressed, noting that “small
companies and large companies can choose to refuse plastic” and push
their suppliers to do the same.
</p>
<p>
This is significant because, as is the case at COP, oil-rich nations
(and
<a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/11/27/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-flood-final-scheduled-round-of-global-plastics-treaty-negotiations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oil-rich
lobbyists</u></a>) hold outsized negotiating power at the meetings.
Despite more than 100 nations favoring an agreement that would have
curbed plastic <em><em>production </em></em>— turning off the tap at the
source, as plastic-reduction advocates like to say — Russia, Saudi
Arabia, and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/01/plastic-pollution-treaty-global-un-busan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pushed
for a treaty</u></a> last week that would have focused on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>plastic
recycling</u></a> and
“<a href="https://american-chemistry.read.axioshq.com/p/acc-news-release/f2029ecb-155c-442a-b3b4-1a27b391b42f?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_location=email_view_in_browser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mismanaged
waste</u></a>,” instead, an insistence that led negotiations straight
into an impasse.
(<a href="https://grist.org/regulation/us-backtracks-production-caps-global-plastics-treaty-united-nations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>After
flip-flopping</u></a>, the United States took a noncommittal middle
ground of opposing mandatory production caps but otherwise agreeing that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/world-unable-cope-10-years-talks-un-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-waste" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
much plastic is probably bad</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
In the absence of a treaty and with pessimism growing around INC-5.2,
business-led action might be the best shot remaining for plastic-free
organizers. “Having these companies step up on their own is huge and
would help us all,” Morelli said.

<h2 id="us-unveils-fresh-export-curbs-targeting-chinas-chip-sector">US
unveils fresh export curbs targeting China’s chip sector</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States announced new export restrictions
Monday taking aim at China’s ability to make advanced semiconductors —
used in weapon systems and artificial intelligence  as competition
intensifies between the world’s two biggest economies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our
technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our
national security,” said White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan in a statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners
to “to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading
technologies and know-how.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies,
including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production
equipment, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as
reassessing and updating our controls,” added Under Secretary of
Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest announcement also includes controls on two dozen types of
chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or
producing semiconductors.</p>

returns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Maybe it broke, maybe it doesn’t fit, or maybe we realized we don’t need
a Godzilla-shaped humidifier — whatever the reason, returns are
expensive for stores, and they’re cracking down. Some 81% of retailers
started charging customers for at least one of their return options last
year. We’ll hear more. Plus, the dollar swings after Trump threatens
tariffs, and a shipbuilder in Northern Ireland files for bankruptcy.

id="analysts-say-bidens-first-trip-to-africa-shouldve-come-earlier-in-presidency">Analysts
say Biden’s first trip to Africa should’ve come earlier in
presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S.
Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first
presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a
quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come
sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given
its troubling human rights record.</p>
<p>White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to
visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some
analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps
down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier.  </p>
<p>Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke
to VOA from South Africa. </p>
<p>“I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise
just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and,
of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels
like an afterthought to his presidency,” said Nel. </p>
<p>After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s
northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola.  </p>
<p>There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade,
investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s
President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on
trade, security, and health. </p>
<p>More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature
initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway
project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan
port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.  </p>
<p>The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple
partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies
around the world, officials say.  </p>
<p>Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior
director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking
about the broader benefits associated with the project. </p>
<p>“What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it
isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the
communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access
to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and
it’s about increases in digital connectivity,” said Brown.</p>
<p>Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion,
making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan
Africa. </p>
<p>Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil
producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural
resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people,
resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment
and high cost of living.  </p>
<p>Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. </p>
<p>“Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs
to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so,
to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and
it has massive potential,” said Nel.  </p>
<p>But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties,
Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they
see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing
concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society
organizations and freedom of expression.  </p>
<p>In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly
criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And “if human rights
are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand
Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government
critics.”   </p>
<p>Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights
in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment.  </p>
<p>“I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting
President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I
commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask
those tough questions to President João Lourenço,” said Nuvunga. “We
have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained
unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails,
some of them in critical conditions,” said Nuvunga.  </p>
<p>Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.</p>

id="chief-of-icc-lashes-out-at-us-and-russia-over-threats-accusations">Chief
of ICC lashes out at US and Russia over threats, accusations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Hague, Netherlands — The president of the International Criminal
Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with
its investigations, calling attacks on the court “appalling.”</p>
<p>“The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by
another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a
terrorist organization,” Judge Tomoko Akane said in her address to the
institution’s annual meeting, which opened on Monday.</p>
<p>Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham,
whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in
January, and who called the court a “dangerous joke” and urged Congress
to sanction its prosecutor. “To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany,
France, if you try to help the ICC, we’re going to sanction you,” Graham
said on Fox News.</p>
<p>Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had
granted a request from the court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue
arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his
former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief for crimes against
humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza.</p>
<p>This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a
sitting leader of a major Western ally.</p>
<p>ICC faces challenges on arrest warrants</p>
<p>Graham’s threat isn’t seen as just empty words. President-elect
Donald Trump sanctioned the court’s previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda,
with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and
intelligence officials in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. “Several elected
officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member
of the Security Council,” she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and
others in response to the investigation into Putin.</p>
<p>The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC’s 124 member
countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members
and approve the court’s budget against a backdrop of unfavorable
headlines.</p>
<p>The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court of
last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous
atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime
of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable
or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124
countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the
institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China.</p>
<p>The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute
arrest warrants.</p>
<p>The decision to warrant issues for Netanyahu and Israel’s ex-Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant has been denounced by critics of the court and
given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark
contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian
President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the
former defense minister “outrageous” and vowed to stand with Israel. A
year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin “justified” and said the
Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC
member country.</p>
<p>France said it would “respect its obligations” but would need to
consider Netanyahu’s possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was
announced, France said it would “lend its support to the essential work”
of the court.</p>
<p>Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would
arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants “utterly incomprehensible.”
Italy called them “wrong” but said it would be obliged to arrest him.
Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it
would stand with Israel instead of the court.</p>
<p>Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could
undermine global justice efforts. “It really has the potential to damage
not just the court, but international law,” she told The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State
University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a
number of people who contribute to the court’s work, such as
international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the
current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and
others.</p>
<p>“Sanctions are a huge burden,” Sterio said.</p>
<p>Accusations against Khan</p>
<p>Also hanging heavy over the meeting in The Hague are the internal
pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old
British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide
into a sexual relationship and groped her.</p>
<p>Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged
misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it
interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she
opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He
has denied the claims.</p>
<p>The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an
external probe into the allegations. It’s not clear if the investigation
will be addressed during the meeting.</p>
<p>Khan took the floor after Akane. He didn’t address the accusations
against him or the threats against the court directly, other than to say
the institution was facing “unprecedented challenges.”</p>
<p>Instead he highlighted his office’s recent request for an arrest
warrant against the head of Myanmar’s military government and said he
planned to request warrants related to Afghanistan and Sudan in the
coming months.</p>
<p>Late last week, six countries including France, Luxembourg and Mexico
asked Khan’s office to look into possible crimes in Afghanistan since
the Taliban took control in 2021. While Khan isn’t obligated to open an
investigation in response to such a request, historically court
prosecutors have done so.</p>
<p>The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will
have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has
issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile
suspects remain at large.</p>
<p>Member states don’t always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when
he visited in September. Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir is
wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur,
but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested
a warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime, Senior Gen. Min
Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority.
Judges have yet to decide on that request.</p>
<p>“It becomes very difficult to justify the court’s existence,” Sterio
said.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-four-years-will-be-a-fight.-embrace-it.">The Next Four
Years Will Be a Fight. Embrace It.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDk5NDg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTE1OTUzNn0.xfL2Iq1IUoHqYm_oOBgAvWVvjjqQt4szCgdBuJ9O9lE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, millions of people
participated in hundreds of marches around the country and the world to
demonstrate their commitment in the new cause of resistance. No such
large-scale protests are materializing for next January 20; those who
hoped Trump would lose the presidential election now seem more
demoralized than defiant.
</p>
<p>
That reaction is understandable. After a period of progress and optimism
about the future, and even as the climate crisis grows more dire, we are
in for a difficult four years. As Jesse Jenkins
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a>
just after the election, the outcome “dealt a devastating blow to U.S.
efforts to cut climate-warming pollution.”
</p>
<p>
But for those feeling despair, there is a way forward: <em><em>Embrace
the fight</em></em>. Sometimes politics is about compromise, sometimes
it’s about patience, and sometimes it’s about righteous fury. This time,
fury may be just what’s called for.
</p>
<p>
There’s no doubt that some very bad vibrations will emanate from
Washington. Trump is arriving with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project
2025 blueprint</u></a> in hand, ready to undermine climate progress in
every corner of government. Key agencies will be led by a veritable
murderer’s row of fossil fuel enthusiasts, from the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy" target="_self"><u>fracking
executive</u></a> who will helm the Department of Energy to the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>all-of-the-above</u></a>”
enthusiast who will lead both the Department of the Interior and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self"><u>the
new National Energy Council</u></a>, the goal of which is to achieve
what Trump calls, in all caps, “ENERGY DOMINANCE.”
</p>
<p>
As far as Trump is concerned, “dominance” comes not from wimpy
renewables but from pounding holes in the ground and burning what comes
out of them, the manly pursuit of those whose hearts beat faster at the
thought of America’s foes kneeling in submission before our virile
power. And it comes from reversing whatever Joe Biden did, not because
Trump necessarily cares whether consumers get subsidies to buy heat
pumps, but because undoing his predecessor’s legacy shows that Trump is
a winner and everyone else is a loser.
</p>
<p>
As much as
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/after-voters-soundly-rejected-it-electing-trump-what-s-next-for-the-radical-climate-agenda/ar-AA1uOC9s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some</u></a>
would like us to believe that by giving Trump one of the
<a href="https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/busting-myths-about-the-2024-election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>narrowest</u></a>
presidential victories in history the voters were explicitly rejecting
the Biden administration’s climate policies in favor of Trump’s fossil
fuel agenda, there is no evidence that’s true. As much as we would have
liked it to be otherwise,
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most</u></a>
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polls</u></a>
showed climate change ranking low when people were asked what decided
their vote. Indeed, the most persuasive explanation for the election
outcome is that all over the world, voters have turned out whichever
party was in power when the wave of post-pandemic inflation hit; Kamala
Harris nearly overcame that anti-incumbent wave, but wasn’t able to in
the end.
</p>
<p>
So while Trump may not have much of a “mandate” in general, he certainly
doesn’t have one to reverse the progress the country has made on
climate. That means the politics of opposing the administration’s
climate efforts are in advocates’ favor. At the very least, there is
plenty of room to persuade the public that the Trump administration is
doing something awful on climate.
</p>
<p>
Embracing the fight will mean acknowledging that while bipartisanship is
sometimes an effective tool, it isn’t an end in itself. Republicans
should certainly be welcomed as allies whenever they want to join in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/conservative-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>defending
climate progress</u></a> or pushing back on efforts to undermine it, but
the days when Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich would
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6n_-wB154" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>film
an ad together</u></a> pledging their commitment to address climate
change are long behind us. It would be nice if there was a consensus on
the need to transition off of fossil fuels, but there isn’t. Instead,
there’s a climate assault on its way, and while appeals to the
self-interest of some Republicans (such as those politicians
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/old-school-politics-ira" target="_self"><u>whose
districts</u></a> are benefiting enormously from clean energy
investments) are possible, a battle is more likely.
</p>
<p>
That isn’t a bad thing. Conflicts are energizing — they clarify stakes,
focus media attention, and motivate people to get involved. And just as
many climate advocates realized that warnings of doom (even accurate
ones) are often less effective than an optimistic vision of a future of
abundance, we should also understand that one of the most powerful
arguments in politics is that someone is trying to take something away
from you. Which is exactly what Trump will likely do, and when it
happens, people ought to be mad about it.
</p>
<p>
This fight will take place both in Washington and between the Trump
administration on one side and
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/what-can-us-cities-and-states-do-for-the-climate-under-trump-plenty/ar-AA1uRBeQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>states
and cities</u></a> on the other. Ambitious Democrats including Governor
Gavin Newsom of California are looking for ways to resist the new Trump
administration, not only on substantive grounds but also because
standing up to Trump is good politics for them. When they do so on
climate policy (as Newsom did when he
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-newsom-ev-electric-vehicle-rebate-b55ab3d35145384c1bb192cbda536b0a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>
that his state offer tax credits for electric vehicles if Republicans
eliminate the ones provided for in the Inflation Reduction Act), it will
highlight climate actions Trump is taking that might otherwise have been
overlooked.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the climate story of the past few years has been an
encouraging one — the passage of the IRA (the most consequential climate
law ever), steadily dropping prices for renewables, innovations in
energy and carbon mitigation, and more. The next few years will be
characterized by conflict.
</p>
<p>
That may not be what climate advocates want, but it’s unavoidable. And
no outcome is predetermined. November 5 altered the politics of climate
change, but it didn’t end them; there will be plenty of opportunities to
create controversies, exploit political opportunities, and get voters
justifiably angry. Fighting — thoughtfully, with careful planning and
energy — will be more important than ever.

Committee meeting in South Korea was the fifth such summit so far and

to kick the can down the road and return for more talks at an

different from those hampering the COP climate talks on fossil fuel use,
with major oil-producing nations blocking meaningful progress. In this
case, while more than 100 countries called for a binding treaty to
reduce plastic production, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others opposed this

management. The U.S signalled support for the idea of reducing plastic
pollution but

Ten fines Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for postgame melee</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROSEMONT, Ill. — The Big Ten Conference announced it fined Michigan
and Ohio State $100,000 each for violating the conference’s
sportsmanship policy for the on-field melee at the end of the
Wolverines’ win in Columbus on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Not only did the actions of both teams violate fundamental elements
of sportsmanship such as respect and civility, the nature of the
incident also jeopardized the safety of participants and bystanders,”
the Big Ten said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>A fight broke out at midfield after the Wolverines’ 13-10 victory
when Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on the OSU logo and
were confronted by the Buckeyes.</p>
<p>Police used pepper spray to break up the players, who threw punches
and shoves. One officer suffered a head injury when he was “knocked down
and trampled while trying to separate players fighting,” a police union
official said. The officer was taken to a hospital and has since been
released.</p>
<p>After the Ohio State players confronted their rivals at midfield,
defensive end Jack Sawyer grabbed the top of the Wolverines’ flag and
ripped it off the pole as the brawl moved toward the Michigan bench.</p>
<p>“We respect the Big Ten Conference’s decision in this matter,” Ohio
State said in a statement. “What happened post-game yesterday was
unfortunate. Good sportsmanship is always important in everything we do
at Ohio State. Moving forward, we will continue to examine and address
our post-game protocols to ensure our student-athletes, coaches,
visiting teams and staff safely exit the field.”</p>
<p>Ohio State police said in a statement that “multiple officers
representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray.” Michigan players
could be seen rubbing their eyes after exposure to the chemical
irritant.</p>
<p>Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said after the game both teams could
have handled the situation differently.</p>
<p>“So much emotions on both sides,” he said. “Rivalry games get heated,
especially this one. It’s the biggest one in the country, so we got to
handle that better.”</p>
<p>A Michigan athletic department spokesman said Sunday night the
football program would have no comment beyond the team’s remarks
Saturday.</p>
<p>The scuffle was one of many that broke out Saturday in rivalry games
across the country.</p>

<h2 id="biden-pardons-son-hunter-for-gun-tax-offenses">Biden pardons son
Hunter for gun, tax offenses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter,
who was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could
have been imprisoned for years.   </p>
<p>Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a
lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life
spiraled out of control. </p>
<p>But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s
prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at
undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race
in July for another four-year term. </p>
<p>“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my
political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose
my election,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun
purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not
be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  </p>
<p>He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he
was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  </p>
<p>He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a
scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although
sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he
would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the
gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be
handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing
scheduled in Delaware for December 13. </p>
<p>The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as
well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken
part” from Jan. 1, 2014, to Jan. 1, 2024.   </p>
<p>Hunter Biden said in a statement, “I have admitted and taken
responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction –
mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and
my family for political sport.” </p>
<p>The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will
understand why a father and a president would come to this
decision.”   </p>
<p>“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell
the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth:
I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I
also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a
miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend,
there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an
abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump
supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array
of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6,
2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had
defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he
takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential
election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but
many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet
to occur. </p>
<p>Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned
Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was
convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he
intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to
France. </p>
<p>Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers,
Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief
strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among
others.  </p>
<p>Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S.
political landscape and not always predictably along political party
lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are
announced. </p>
<p>Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he
understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he
said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country.
This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and
will sadly tarnish his reputation.” </p>
<p>Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect
President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a
politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was
convicted by a jury of his peers.” </p>
<p>Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he
was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many
times he wouldn’t &amp; I believed him. Shame on me.”  </p>
<p>But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under
former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only
prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney
“would have charged this case given the underlying facts.” </p>

id="trump-appoints-lebanese-american-massad-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser">Trump
appoints Lebanese American Massad Boulos as Middle East adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he had appointed
American Lebanese businessman Massad Boulos, the father of one of his
sons-in-law, as his Middle East adviser.</p>
<p>“Massad is a skilled negotiator and a steadfast advocate for PEACE in
the Middle East. He will be a staunch defender of the United States and
its interests,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, as the conflict between
Israel and Hamas has been plaguing the region for more than a year.</p>
<p>A longtime Republican, Boulos built his fortune selling automobiles
in Nigeria. The 2022 marriage of his son Michael Boulos to Donald
Trump’s daughter Tiffany propelled him into the newly elected
billionaire’s inner circle.</p>
<p>Boulos took an active part in the presidential campaign, working to
convince the Arab community in some key states to vote for Trump.</p>
<p>“Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected business
leader with extensive experience on the international stage,” the
president-elect, who is due to take office on January 20, said.</p>
<p>A Maronite Christian, Boulos had tried to get elected as a
parliamentarian in Lebanon, without success.</p>
<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end
the conflict between Israel and Hamas, without ever revealing a plan to
do so.</p>
<p>Boulos had explained in October that he shared the same
philosophy.</p>
<p>Israel “has military objectives to achieve, namely to get rid of
Hamas’ infrastructure and its capacity to launch new attacks,” he said
in an interview with Sky News.</p>
<p>But “they have to do it very quickly. (…), It cannot last forever,”
he added.</p>
<p>His appointment comes days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel
and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Islamist movement allied with Hamas and
Iran.</p>
<p>This truce in Lebanon gives hope for progress in the Middle East to
the administration of Joe Biden, still in power for a few weeks.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Lebanon deal, the United States is “actively”
working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Jake
Sullivan, the current White House national security adviser, said
Sunday. But “we’re not there yet,” he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump also named Charles Kushner, the father of his
other son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, as U.S.
ambassador to France.</p>
<p>An unusual choice for a diplomatic role: Kushner spent a year in
federal prison for tax fraud before being pardoned by Trump toward the
end of his first term in the White House.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Honululu, Hawaii — On a two-day visit to Hawaii, Taiwan’s president
Lai Ching-te met with the state’s governor and congressional
representatives as part of a Pacific island tour that has already
triggered criticism from Beijing.</p>
<p>On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemned” U.S.
support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also
denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a
self-governing island that China claims as its own territory.</p>
<p>“China will closely monitor the situation’s development and take
resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity,” said the statement.</p>
<p>Hawaii was Lai’s first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take
him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of
the 12 countries Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with.</p>
<p>Hawaii’s Gov. Josh Green on Saturday hosted Lai at the state’s
emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness.
Green, who was a longtime emergency room physician before becoming
governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their
experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a
physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from
Harvard University.</p>
<p>“Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation,
highlighting Hawai’i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration
with Taiwan,” Green said in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>Lai also visited Bishop Museum, Hawaii’s leading museum of natural
history and Native Hawaiian culture.</p>
<p>In the evening, Lai posed for photos with Hawaii congressional
representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the
Taiwanese American community.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress,
said on social media that he told the audience that “our ties endured on
shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared
challenges.”</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from
the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump
administration during his Hawaii stay.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in
July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased
billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from
Chinese military action.</p>
<p>The new arms deal announced by the U.S. State Department Friday
includes $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s,
as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the
Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity
over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by
China.</p>
<p>Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew vocal opposition from
China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin
America. Tsai met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the
time.</p>
<p>The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as
a “stern warning” over what it called collusion between “separatists and
foreign forces” days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped
over in the U.S.</p>
<p>China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting
the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and
Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.
Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1979.</p>

has AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House, observing World AIDS Day</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday had the AIDS Memorial
Quilt spread on the White House South Lawn for the first time in
observance of World AIDS Day.</p>
<p>Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors,
family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the
epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government’s support for
the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS.</p>
<p>“This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of
America,” Biden said. “For all the lives lost, for all those that are
still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and
minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That’s the
power of this movement.”</p>
<p>There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate
people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the
quilt made its first public appearance in 1987. There was also a red
ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS,
draped across the South Portico of the White House.</p>
<p>There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to
the White House.</p>
<p>Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White,
contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and
died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son’s experience taught
America that “we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have
it.”</p>
<p>The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990, and White-Grinder
recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met
Biden when he was a senator from Delaware.</p>
<p>The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious
disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, Fauci was in
attendance at the event as he worked to treat AIDS, though he’s known by
much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic
that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the
epidemic, and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other
steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure
prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV
infections.</p>

<h2 id="trump-nominates-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser">Trump nominates
Boulos as Middle East adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday his nomination of
Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos to serve as a senior adviser
on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany.  He was a
member of Trump’s election campaign, working on the outreach to Arab
American communities in the key state of Michigan amid dissatisfaction
with the Biden administration’s response to Israel’s offensives against
militants in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Trump won the state in last month’s election after losing there to
President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>“Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the
Middle East,” Trump said on his Truth Social site.  “He will be a strong
advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to
have him on our team!”</p>
<p>Trump on Saturday named Kash Patel to lead the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, saying he “is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and
‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption,
defending justice, and protecting the American people.” </p>
<p>Patel, 44, held three defense, intelligence and national security
posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the
incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the “deep state” at the
FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against
Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the
once-and-future president, journalists and others.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI
director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic,
said the appointment would only occur “over my dead body.”</p>
<p>Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and
dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not
launch more intelligence-gathering operations.</p>
<p>Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that
there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by
Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027.</p>
<p>Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before
Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms
by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not
subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired
one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray.</p>
<p>Trump says the FBI is “badly broken” and has “lost the confidence of
America.”</p>
<p>Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough
questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than
10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff
members.</p>
<p>Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump
appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the
health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a
decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the
Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a
Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of
national intelligence.</p>
<p>Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt
Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of
his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has
denied.</p>
<p>Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans
will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could
lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice
President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if
needed.</p>
<p>Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s “Meet the
Press” that Patel “represents the type of change that we need to see in
the FBI. … The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.”</p>
<p>“There are serious problems at the FBI,” Hagerty said. “The American
public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel’s
just the type of person to do it.”</p>
<p>Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a “very
strong nominee” and he thought Patel would be confirmed.</p>
<p>“All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling
their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a
real reformer come into the FBI,” Cruz told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, “Every
president wants people that are loyal to themselves.” But he called Wray
“a very good man,” adding, “I don’t have any complaints about the way
that he’s done his job right now.”</p>
<p>Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, “Patel’s only qualification is that he
agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish,
lock up and intimidate Donald Trump’s political opponents.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

id="moana-2-has-record-221-million-opening-hollywood-celebrates-moviegoing-feast">‘Moana
2’ has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing
feast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. “Moana
2” brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day
weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to
studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with “Wicked” and “Gladiator
II,” made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of
blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December.</p>
<p>Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” but the film
— originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to
the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening
set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was
$125 million for “Frozen 2” in its second week of release in 2019.)
“Moana 2” added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million
worldwide, it’s the second-best global launch of the year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sensation of “Wicked” showed no signs of
slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million
over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2
million. Not accounting for inflation, “Wicked” is now the highest
grossing Broadway adaptation over “Grease.” (That 1978 film grossed $190
million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)</p>
<p>“Gladiator II,” meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its
opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture
original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep
price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging,
“Gladiator II” has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420
million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to
Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry
that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages
and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that
showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before
“Wicked,” “Moana 2” and “Gladiator II” arrived in theaters, ticket sales
were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National
Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible
when “all the pieces of the puzzle come together” in compelling
big-budget movies with marketing muscle.</p>
<p>“We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we
believe is a full-on charge into the future,” he said. “The remaining
quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and
2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this
industry has had in a long time.”</p>
<p>Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release
calendar — 2023’s much-ballyhooed “Barbenheimer” — the movie industry
again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all
blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out
most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, “Venom: The Last
Dance,” for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks,
despite not being particularly successful.</p>
<p>“For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you
don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,” said O’Leary.
“But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for
the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners.
But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.”</p>
<p>“Moana 2” was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first
began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when
Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance
between theatrical and streaming. The original “Moana,” after all, was
the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of
$680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger
announce the release of “Moana 2,” with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne
Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.</p>
<p>“It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not
adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,” says Paul
Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Whoever made that
decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,’ that was one of the
greatest decisions ever.”</p>
<p>And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two
animated November releases — “Strange World” and “Wish” — fizzled in
theaters. “Moana 2” may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for
the studio in 2024, along with “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp;
Wolverine.” Though reviews for “Moana 2” have only been 65% “fresh” on
Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore.</p>
<p>“Moana 2” is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing.
According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a
newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is
going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly
the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.</p>
<p>After such large debuts, “Moana 2” and “Wicked” are likely to
continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be
if this year’s Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday
period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup.
Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney’s “Mufasa:
The Lion King,” Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” and Searchlight’s “A
Complete Unknown,” with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Moana 2,” $135 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Wicked,” $80 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Gladiator II” $30.7 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Red One,” $12.9 million.</p></li>

<li><p>“Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,” $2.4 million.</p></li>

id="heavy-snow-and-numbing-temperatures-keep-parts-of-the-us-in-deep-freeze">Heavy
snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOWVILLE, N.Y. — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts
of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend
draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers
and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather
forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in
Buffalo.</p>
<p>In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect
snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time,
there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area.</p>
<p>“We just keep digging out,” Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said
Sunday. “We were out all day yesterday, plowing.”</p>
<p>Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck
for much of the winter, “and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a
snowblower.”</p>
<p>His advice? “If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow
down.”</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night </p>
<p>In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow
shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against
the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and
provide food and hot drinks.</p>
<p>A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’
stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the
stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather
Risk Communication Center in New York.</p>
<p>“Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake
effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over
the stadium longer,” the center said in a post on the social media site
X.</p>
<p>Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border</p>
<p>Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and
15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New
York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey
tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19
hours, stuck inside Schintzius’ Honda Pilot.</p>
<p>The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first
on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and
again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by
some residents.</p>
<p>“There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of
people, tons,” Schintzius said by phone Sunday.</p>
<p>While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid
it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to
check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in,
along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of
muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had
water.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,” said
Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and
fruit. “And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.”</p>
<p>When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned
around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow
that was still falling.</p>
<p>“We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m
not getting stuck in that ever again,” she said.</p>
<p>Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures</p>
<p>A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of
10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees
Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather
Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota.
Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by
Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius)
below average.</p>
<p>Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy
lake-effect snow has produced “treacherous” conditions that are causing
even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to
clear city roads.</p>
<p>The city estimated Sunday morning that there were “about 100 cars
throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of
the way so plows can get through.”</p>
<p>Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in
western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the
Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow
was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday,
with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible.</p>
<p>New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies</p>
<p>In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy
Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying
snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility
providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state
to assist.</p>
<p>“I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle,
but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make
sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy
holiday weekend,” she said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency
proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest
received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday
night.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during
the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials
said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound
lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Michigan battered by lake-effect snow</p>
<p>Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens
when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air
overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the
Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette,
Michigan.</p>
<p>Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for
holiday travel on Sunday. </p>
<p>“Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow
bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,” the
National Weather Service said Sunday.</p>
<p>There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the
Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in
Munising, in the eastern area. </p>
<p>Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the
eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25
centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday.</p>
<p>Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a
new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts,
said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous
record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942.</p>
<p>Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord,
said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time
year, “but that magnitude certainly is not.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,” he
added.</p>
<p>The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32
hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base
that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort’s season
opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said.</p>
<p>“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow
hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,”
Hoeh said.</p>

<h2 id="us-will-not-return-nuclear-weapons-to-ukraine">US will not
return nuclear weapons to Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear
weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.</p>
<p>Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times
article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had
suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he
leaves office.</p>
<p>“That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging
various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively
defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them]
nuclear capability,” he told ABC.</p>
<p>Last week, Russia said the idea was “absolute insanity” and that
preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops
into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991
collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest
Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United
States and Britain.</p>

to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in
Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola this week,
he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at
securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the
Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s
strategy to counter China’s clout in global development.</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple
sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer
Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of
Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in
its second phase, to Zambia.</p>
<p>Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes
from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI
is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest
economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in
2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the
United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are
essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S.
congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned.
China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals,
including 76% of its cobalt.</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open
access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic
growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the
U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters.</p>
<p>The PGI’s investments will “amplify the impact of that
infrastructure” with projects such as developing solar energy, local
electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said.</p>
<p>The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola
owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt.
The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans,
backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following
three decades of civil war that ended in 2002.</p>
<p>PGI to counter BRI</p>
<p>Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China
has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa,
Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and
seven regional institutions.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure
projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis,
while the U.S. provided $76 billion.</p>
<p>The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims
to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure
financing models that are “often opaque, fail to uphold environmental
and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries
worse off.”</p>
<p>That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito
is “the first and the most developed” project in that effort, said
Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.</p>
<p>“That’s the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other
projects,” Schneidman told VOA.</p>
<p>The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to
support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in
the Philippines.</p>
<p>In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon,
the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as
semiconductors.</p>
<p>The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled
back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors.</p>
<p>“We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a
part of the larger G7,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA
during a briefing last month.</p>
<p>“And that’s not just been for two corridors,” he said. “That’s been
for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.”</p>
<p>US-Africa strategy</p>
<p>In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy
that “reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security
interests,” the strategy says.</p>
<p>Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where
he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three
years.</p>
<p>“We are overdelivering on that thus far,” Frances Brown, senior
director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a
briefing Tuesday. “We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.”</p>
<p>But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs
and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is “visible to the
average African that says the United States financed that in the way
that the Chinese do,” said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is
the “one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is
implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’”</p>
<p>On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses
and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin
in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s
a start.</p>
<p>Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and
environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese
financing.</p>
<p>“We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the
process,” said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of
Angola.</p>
<p>So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but
they are ready to ensure that local communities can “share as much as
possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>Will it continue?</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some
are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his
America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his
first administration.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an
initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help
investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue
Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure
infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards.</p>
<p>They were aware that infrastructure investments needed “to foster
economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests
globally when competing with China,” said Joseph Lemoine, senior
director of the Atlantic Council’s Freedom and Prosperity Center. “I’m
hopeful that they will continue those efforts,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s
development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity.</p>
<p>DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s
son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to
foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2
billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump
administration’s Abraham Accords and recognize Israel.</p>
<p>“If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy
that’s transactional,” Schneidman at Brookings said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China.
Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s
foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that
developing nations can leverage.</p>

id="eggs-are-available-but-pricier-as-the-holiday-baking-season-begins">Eggs
are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird
flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season.</p>
<p>But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two
years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages
at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far.</p>
<p>“Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day,” said
Emily Metz, the Egg Board’s president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in
October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down
slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when
the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023,
when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07.</p>
<p>Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During
testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission’s case seeking to
block Kroger’s merger with Albertsons, Kroger’s senior director for
pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and
eggs beyond the levels of inflation.</p>
<p>But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the
egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for
example.</p>
<p>“You can’t have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing,
without eggs,” she said.</p>
<p>Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The
current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the
slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens.
Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the
spread of the disease.</p>
<p>More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month
because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S.
egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about
3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs
because California has been among the hardest hit states. California,
Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to
be cage-free.</p>
<p>“We’re having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are
producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because
those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,” Metz said.</p>
<p>Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado
and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.</p>
<p>Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu,
which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past
farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk,
said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State
University.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to control that interaction between domesticated
birds and wild birds,” Hart said. “Some of those vectors have been
opened up because we’re asking the egg industry to produce in ways that
we didn’t ask them to before.”</p>
<p>Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some
wild birds off course.</p>
<p>“We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires,
and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might
not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be
circulating,” she said. “And those are all new variables that our
farmers are having to deal with.”</p>
<p>Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that
also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to
hatch into new chickens.</p>
<p>Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of
chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer’s costs — has fallen
significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.</p>

id="more-sand-is-in-sight-for-a-jersey-shore-resort-towns-deteriorating-beaches">More
sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town’s deteriorating
beaches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the
condition of a New Jersey resort town’s beaches, involving tens of
millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end
soon.  </p>
<p>Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has
reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures
to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the
Philadelphia area.  </p>
<p>The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood’s
council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the
Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is
sometime in 2025, he said.  </p>
<p>The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined
North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could
actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit
against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent
trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach
over the past decade.   </p>
<p>“We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead
of suing each other,” Rosenello said Wednesday.  </p>
<p>At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is
virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full
beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property
owners has contributed to the delay.  </p>
<p>Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective
sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to
flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in
January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a
dune barely reaching his knees.  </p>
<p>The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment
project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the
erosion in North Wildwood “shocking.” Rosenello said that work has held
up well in the ensuing months.  </p>
<p>The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed
agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and
signed and sent to the state Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute
$1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment
project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state
water pollution control fund, the mayor said.  </p>
<p>The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North
Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other
shore protection work including extension of a sea wall.  </p>
<p>On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs,
including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the
state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection
commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have
more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of
future shore protection funding.</p>

id="us-proposes-new-habitat-protections-in-southern-rockies-for-canada-lynx">US
proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada
lynx</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan
for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new
habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the
forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald
Trump: Officials during the Republican’s first term sought
unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they’ve had since 2000
under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado
and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That’s
different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and
concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming,
Montana, Minnesota and Maine.</p>
<p>“This is a significant change and a good one,” said Matthew Bishop,
an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved
in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. “They weren’t really
committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are.”</p>
<p>Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana.
Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday’s
proposal.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they
consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas
that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term
survival.</p>
<p>Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey
primarily on snowshoe hares.</p>
<p>They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest
Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn’t have sufficient
regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm.
Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged
as a new, worsening threat.</p>
<p>Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx’s snowy habitat and
could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are
expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic
warming scenario that officials have considered.</p>
<p>Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the
animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed.</p>
<p>Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at
the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain
some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world.</p>
<p>The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that
faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for
lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho.</p>
<p>There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to
estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some
areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population
of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period.</p>
<p>More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999
and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain.</p>
<p>“There were concerns about whether it would stick,” said U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. “But they do seem to be
hanging on.”</p>
<p>Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds,
with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone
National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for
the longest time, he said.</p>
<p>Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by
climate change.</p>
<p>“We’ve got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want
to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control,”
Zelenak said. “So we don’t want to put roads in the wrong places. We
don’t want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the
hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming
future.”</p>
<p>Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged
under the proposal.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected late next year.</p>

Trump has sought Orban’s take on Ukraine war, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone
conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning
the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to
RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service.</p>
<p>Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on
ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s
full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that
the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its
invasion.</p>
<p>He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the
White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that
Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.</p>
<p>Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and
has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow.</p>
<p>Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second
crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU
presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure
started.</p>
<p>In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow
to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire
proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled
to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on
the presidential campaign trail.</p>
<p>Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but
sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve
delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President
Xi Jinping.</p>

<h2 id="trump-set-to-nominate-former-prosecutor-to-head-fbi">Trump set
to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he wanted
former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the
FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau’s current director,
Christopher Wray.</p>
<p>Patel, who during Trump’s first term advised both the director of
national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously
called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and
purging its ranks of any employee who refuses to support Trump’s
agenda.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem the FBI has had, has come out of its intel
shops. I’d break that component out of it. I’d shut down the FBI Hoover
building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep
state,” Patel said in a September interview on the conservative “Shawn
Ryan Show.”</p>
<p>“And I’d take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send
them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You’re cops. Go
be cops.”</p>
<p>With the nomination of Patel, Trump, a Republican, seems to be
preparing to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump. Wray’s
10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027.</p>
<p>Asked about Patel’s nomination, which will need Senate confirmation,
an FBI spokesperson said on Saturday: “Every day, the men and women of
the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of
threats. Director Wray’s focus remains on the men and women of the FBI,
the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.”</p>
<p>FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of
insulating the bureau from politics.</p>
<p>Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for
investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump
supporters’ ire.</p>
<p>During Wray’s tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at
Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He also has
faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney
General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards
from violent threats and harassment.</p>
<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions
against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining
classified documents, asked on November 25 the judges overseeing those
cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a
Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>
<p>Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and
was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a
person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Patel, 44, previously worked as a federal public defender and a
federal prosecutor.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans’ probe into
the FBI’s 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign
and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence
Committee Chair Devin Nunes.</p>
<p>Later, during Trump’s first impeachment trial, ex-National Security
Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned
Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine
without authorization.</p>
<p>Patel denied those allegations.</p>
<p>After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several
people Trump designated as a representative for access to his
presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration
officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all
of the records in question.</p>
<p>He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection
with the probe.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, Trump named Chad Chronister, the sheriff of
Hillsborough County, Florida, as his choice for administrator of the
Drug Enforcement Agency. In that role, Chronister would work closely
with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.</p>
<p>Bondi is from the Tampa area that Chronister serves.</p>
<p>“As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney
General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and
other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,” Trump
wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump also named real estate mogul Charles Kushner to serve as U.S.
ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump son-in-law Jared
Kushner.</p>
<p>“He (Charles Kushner) is a tremendous business leader,
philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate
representing our Country &amp; its interests,” Trump said in a post on
Truth Social announcing the pick.</p>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is “excited” to make his
first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop
briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall
in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official
told VOA Friday.</p>
<p>“He is excited and really looking forward to the trip,” Frances
Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security
Council, told VOA at the White House. “I think the president really sees
this as a way to sum up all that he’s tried to put forward during this
administration on our Africa strategy.”</p>
<p>While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on
bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and
on improving technological and scientific cooperation.</p>
<p>“He sees Angola as the perfect place for this,” she said.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden’s vow to visit Africa —
made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola
in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing
down on the eastern United States.</p>
<p>“I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his
administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of
his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather
hollow,” Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed
development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which
connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The
U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment
on the project.</p>
<p>When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola’s many
documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced
by Biden administration officials, saying: “he never shies away from
talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts.”</p>
<p>The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a
way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the
Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity
for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a
flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime,” he said.</p>
<p>He added, “That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess,
mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the
visit by saying that the Biden administration isn’t just stopping in one
African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the
other side of the democracy spectrum.”</p>
<p>Angola’s president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the
African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil
giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and
far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African “coup belt.”
This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden’s core beliefs as he prepares
to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and
problem-solvers.</p>
<p>While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees
the future of relations between Washington and the continent.</p>
<p>“I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African
leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that’s
why he’ll be amplifying Angola’s role mediating in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and elsewhere,” she said. “And I think he wants to
convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which
is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the
U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.”</p>

names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US
ambassador</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday
he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles
Kushner “a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp;
dealmaker.”</p>
<p>Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm.
Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is
married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka.</p>
<p>The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after
pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign
donations.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his
brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an
investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation.</p>
<p>Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged
to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden
camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife,
prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion
and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison —
the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris
Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later
governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.</p>
<p>Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s
transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses “one
of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was
U.S. attorney.”</p>
<p>Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles
and their children were married in 2009.</p>

Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up
two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said
Saturday. </p>
<p>Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others
were offered transit papers. </p>
<p>The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump
threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country
does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum
had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the
United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day
that “migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the
border.” </p>
<p>Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of
the two caravans appeared to be part of “an agreement between the
president of Mexico and the president of the United States.” </p>
<p>The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city
of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day
Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost
four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to
Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. </p>
<p>In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired
migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central
Mexico. </p>
<p>“They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from
our group to Oaxaca city,” said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition
supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country’s contested
presidential elections earlier this year. </p>
<p>Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to
Mexico City. </p>
<p>The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and
made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in
Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that
allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. </p>
<p>Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United
States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a
phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. </p>
<p>Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which
were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever
reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way,
though some individual members have made it. </p>
<p>For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or
prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents.
They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the
Guatemalan border.</p>

id="snow-blankets-parts-of-us-during-busy-holiday-travel-weekend">Snow
blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed
towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday
travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to
persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and
Midwest regions. </p>
<p>The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of
New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials
warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to
return home. </p>
<p>“Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend,
especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very
quickly,” the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of
the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61
centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and
29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania’s northwestern
tip. </p>
<p>With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania,
scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a
fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley
said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened
the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. </p>
<p>“It was hard to manage, but we had no choice,” he said. “They just
showed up, and we don’t want to turn people away.” </p>
<p>Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning
as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. </p>
<p>“Everyone helped each other,” he said. “It was pretty cool.” </p>
<p>This week’s blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20
degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather
service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. </p>
<p>Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United
States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. </p>
<p>Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens
when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air
overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the
past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61
centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service’s office in Marquette, Michigan. </p>
<p>Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just
northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, she
said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern
part of the peninsula. </p>
<p>Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot
(30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday
morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the
west. </p>
<p>Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord,
Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day
record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said
Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Gaylord office.
The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9,
1942. </p>
<p>The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80
acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809
hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort’s director of recreation. It
boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the
coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. </p>
<p>“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow
hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,”
Hoeh said. “But we’re close to being ready to pull the trigger on
skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps.” </p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of
disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state’s
northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more
expected through Monday night. </p>
<p>State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour
period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.</p>
