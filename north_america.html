id="french-government-takes-new-blows-over-deal-to-sell-painkiller-maker-to-us-fund">French
government takes new blows over deal to sell painkiller maker to US
fund</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — French drugmaker Sanofi’s confirmation that it will sell a
controlling stake in its consumer health unit to a U.S. investment fund
sparked a new political backlash Monday, stoked by fears the deal marks
a loss of sovereignty over key medications.  </p>
<p>Paris “must block the sale” using powers to protect strategic
sectors, Manuel Bompard, a senior lawmaker in the hard-left France
Unbowed (LFI) party, told the TF1 broadcaster.  </p>
<p>Politicians and unions have torn into Sanofi’s proposed
16-billion-euro ($17.4 billion) deal with U.S. investment fund CD&amp;R
for a controlling stake in Opella.  </p>
<p>The subsidiary makes household-name drugs including Doliprane branded
paracetamol  whose yellow boxes dominate the French market.  </p>
<p>Under pressure, Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s minority government
said it had secured a two-percent stake in Opella for public investment
bank Bpifrance and “extremely strong” guarantees against job cuts and
offshoring.  </p>
<p>Opella employs over 11,000 workers and operates in 100 countries.
 </p>
<p>Sanofi said it is the third-largest business worldwide in the market
for over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and supplements.  </p>
<p>CD&amp;R — which has a battery of investments in France — would help
build Opella into a “French-headquartered, global consumer healthcare
champion,” the pharma giant said in a statement.  </p>
<p>‘Just words’</p>
<p>But with memories of drug shortages during and since the Covid-19
pandemic still raw for many, critics say the defenses are too weak.</p>
<p>A small stake “won’t give the French state a say in strategic
decisions” at Opella, said Bompard, whose LFI dominates a left alliance
that is the largest opposition group against Barnier and President
Emmanuel Macron.  </p>
<p>Thomas Portes, also of the LFI, posted on X that the government had
offered “no guarantees, just words.”  </p>
<p>Economy Minister Antoine Armand said a contract between CD&amp;R,
Sanofi and the government included maintaining production sites,
research and development and Opella’s official headquarters in France,
as well as investing at least 70 million euros over five years.  </p>
<p>It covers “keeping up a minimum production volume for Opella’s
sensitive products in France,” Armand added, including Doliprane,
digestive medication Lanzor and Aspegic branded aspirin.  </p>
<p>There would be financial penalties for closing French production
sites, laying off workers or failing to buy from French suppliers.  </p>
<p>That includes Seqens, a company re-establishing production in France
of Doliprane’s active ingredient paracetamol.  </p>
<p>“Workers are not at all reassured by the latest developments,” said
Johann Nicolas, a CGT union representative at Opella’s Doliprane plant
in Lisieux, northern France.  </p>
<p>He added that a picket had throttled production there from around 1.3
million boxes of the drug per day to around 265,000.  </p>
<p>The proposed protections in the deal have also failed to win over
even some in the government camp.  </p>
<p>Monday’s guarantees “do not at all indicate a commitment for the long
term, whether on investment, supply or jobs,” Charles Rodwell, a
lawmaker in Macron’s EPR party who has closely followed the case, told
AFP.  </p>
<p>He vowed “painstaking” parliamentary surveillance of government
action over the deal including measures to “block” the sale if ministers
fall short.</p>
<p>Brand loyalty</p>
<p>Macron said last week that “the government has the instruments needed
to protect France” from any unwanted “capital ownership.”  </p>
<p>Emotion over the Opella sales is closely linked to Doliprane.  </p>
<p>Boxes of the non-opioid analgesic against mild to moderate pain and
fever often line entire pharmacy walls.  </p>
<p>The drug comes in many doses — from 100 mg for babies to 1,000 mg for
adults — and in tablet, capsule, suppository and liquid forms.  </p>
<p>It is so ubiquitous that French people call any paracetamol product
Doliprane, even when made by a different manufacturer.  </p>
<p>Sanofi, among the world’s top 12 health care companies, says the
planned spinoff is part of a strategy to focus less on over-the-counter
medication and more on innovative medicines and vaccines, including for
polio, influenza and meningitis.</p>

id="should-minimum-wage-be-lower-for-workers-who-get-tipped-two-states-are-set-to-decide">Should
minimum wage be lower for workers who get tipped? Two states are set to
decide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mel Nichols, a 37-year-old bartender in Phoenix, Arizona, takes home
anywhere from $30 to $50 an hour with tips included. But the uncertainty
of how much she’s going to make on a daily basis is a constant source of
stress.</p>
<p>“For every good day, there’s three bad days,” said Nichols, who has
been in the service industry since she was a teenager. “You have no
security when it comes to knowing how much you’re going to make.”</p>
<p>That uncertainty exists largely because federal labor law allows
businesses to pay tipped workers, like food servers, bartenders and
bellhops, less than the minimum wage as long as customer tips make up
the difference. Voters in Arizona and Massachusetts will decide in
November whether it’s good policy to continue to let employers pass some
of their labor costs to consumers.</p>
<p>The ballot measures reflect an accelerating debate over the so-called
subminimum wage, which advocates say is essential to the sustainability
of the service industry and detractors say pushes the cost of labor off
employers’ shoulders and leads to the exploitation of workers.</p>
<p>The amount tipped workers make varies by state. Fourteen states pay
the federal minimum, or just above $2 an hour for tipped workers and $7
an hour for non-tipped workers.</p>
<p>Arizona employers can pay their tipped workers $3 less hourly than
other workers. Under current rates, that means tipped workers’ base pay
is $11.35 an hour.</p>
<p>Voters will decide whether to approve a measure backed by state
Republicans and the Arizona Restaurant Association to change the minimum
for tipped workers to 25% less than the regular minimum wage as long as
their pay with tips is $2 above that minimum.</p>
<p>The hourly minimum wage in Arizona is currently $14.35 and increases
yearly according to inflation.</p>
<p>Voters in Massachusetts are being asked to eliminate the tiered
minimum-wage system.</p>
<p>There, voters will decide on a measure to incrementally increase the
state’s tipped worker wage — currently $6.75 per hour — until it meets
the regular minimum wage by January 2029. The measure was put forward by
One Fair Wage, a not-for-profit that works to end the subminimum
wage.</p>
<p>If voters approve the measure, the Bay State would join seven states
that currently have a single minimum wage. Michigan will soon join that
group after an August state Supreme Court ruling initiated a phase-out
of the subminimum wage.</p>
<p>“When you’re not making the money that you should be making to pay
your bills, it becomes hard on you,” said James Ford, a longtime
Detroit-based hospitality worker. ”[The ruling] makes me think we’re
moving forward.”</p>
<p>Other states have wage measures on the ballot. In California, voters
will choose whether to raise the hourly minimum wage from $16 to $18 by
2026 in what would be the highest statewide minimum wage in the country.
Measures in Alaska and Missouri would gradually raise minimum wages to
$15 an hour while also requiring paid sick leave.</p>
<p>In the last two years, Washington, D.C., and Chicago also have
started to eliminate the subminimum wage.</p>
<p>Employers must ensure that workers get the full minimum if they don’t
make that much with tips. But they don’t always comply with federal
labor law. One in 10 restaurants and bars investigated nationally by the
U.S. Labor Department between 2010 and 2019 violated a provision of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, resulting in the establishments paying $113.9
million in back wages.</p>
<p>The issue disproportionately affects women, who make up about 47% of
the U.S. workforce but nearly 70% of those who work in tipped
professions, according to an AP analysis of U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>In Arizona, Republican state Sen. J.D. Mesnard, the sponsor of
Proposition 138, said the measure is a win for both businesses and
lower-wage workers.</p>
<p>“The employer is protected in the sense that they can preserve this
lower base, knowing that there are going to be tips on top of it,”
Mesnard said. “The tipped worker is guaranteed to make more than minimum
wage, which is more than they’re guaranteed today.”</p>
<p>Nichols doesn’t support it.</p>
<p>“It would reduce my hourly, and anything that reduces my hourly is
not something that I want to lean into,” she said. “I don’t believe that
business owners need any more cuts in labor costs.”</p>
<p>Proposition 138 was initially put forward as a response to a ballot
measure pushed by One Fair Wage that would create a single minimum wage
of $18, but the group abandoned the effort after threats of litigation
from the restaurant association over how it collected signatures.</p>
<p>Instead, One Fair Wage will focus on trying to pass a wage hike in
the Legislature. Democratic State Rep. Mariana Sandoval said she hopes
her party in November can flip the Legislature, where Republicans hold a
one-seat majority in both chambers.</p>
<p>After working for tips for more than 20 years, server Lindsay Ruck,
who works at a restaurant at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport,
said she’s faced her fair share of belligerent customers. But because
their tips make up such a significant part of her pay — approximately
$60 an hour — she’s hesitant to stand up to them.</p>
<p>To Ruck, higher base pay — not less — is called for.</p>
<p>“I think that there should be just a single minimum wage and then
people should get tipped on top of that,” Ruck said.</p>
<p>The National Restaurant Association and its state affiliates warn of
reduced hours, lower employment and menu price hikes if employers can’t
rely on tips to pay their workers. That’s why Dan Piacquadio, a co-owner
of Harold’s Cave Creek Corral restaurant outside Phoenix, is hoping
voters pass Proposition 138.</p>
<p>“This is just a way to protect our current system that’s been there
for 20 years and protect restaurant owners, keep restaurants affordable,
and most importantly, keep very good pay for all tipped workers,”
Piacquadio said.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2019, the number of restaurants and people employed
at those restaurants grew at a faster clip in the seven states that have
a single minimum wage compared to states that pay the federal minimum
tipped wage, according to labor economist Sylvia Allegretto.</p>
<p>“We are sitting here in a state that has a $16 minimum wage,”
Allegretto said from Oakland, California, where she works at the
left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. “No subminimum
wage, and we’ve got a thriving restaurant industry.”</p>

The paper got its hands on confidential documents from the American
Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), which represents some 30
producers. The documents include draft executive orders promoting fossil
fuel production for a newly-elected President Trump to sign if he takes
the White House in November, as well as a roadmap for dismantling many
policies aimed at getting oil and gas producers to disclose and curb
emissions. AXPC’s members, including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and
Hess, account for about half of the oil and gas produced in the U.S.,

from the energy think tank Ember looks at how the uptake of electric
vehicles and heat pumps in the U.K. is affecting oil and gas
consumption. It found that last year the country had 1.5 million EVs on
the road, and 430,000 residential heat pumps in homes, and the reduction
in fossil fuel use due to the growth of these technologies was
equivalent to 14 million barrels of oil, or about what the U.K. imports
over a two-week span. This reduction effect will be even stronger as
more and more EVs and heat pumps are powered by clean energy. The report
also found that even though power demand is expected to rise, efficiency
gains from electrification and decarbonization will make up for this,
leading to an overall decline in energy use and fossil fuel consumption.

to allow autonomous AI agent development starting next month</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Microsoft will allow customers to build autonomous artificial
intelligence agents starting in November, the software giant said on
Monday, in its latest move to tap the booming technology.</p>
<p>The company is positioning autonomous agents — programs which require
little human intervention unlike chatbots — as “apps for an AI-driven
world,” capable of handling client inquiries, identifying sales leads
and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Other big technology firms such as Salesforce have also touted the
potential of such agents, tools that some analysts say could provide
companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars they
are pouring into AI.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its customers can use Copilot Studio - an application
that requires little knowledge of computer code - to create autonomous
agents in public preview from November. It is using several AI models
developed in-house and by OpenAI for the agents.</p>
<p>The company is also introducing ten ready-for-use agents that can
help with routine tasks ranging from managing supply chain to expense
tracking and client communications.</p>
<p>In one demo, McKinsey &amp; Co, which had early access to the tools,
created an agent that can manage client inquires by checking interaction
history, identifying the consultant for the task and scheduling a
follow-up meeting.</p>
<p>“The idea is that Copilot [the company’s chatbot] is the user
interface for AI,” Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business
and industry Copilot at Microsoft, told Reuters.</p>
<p>“Every employee will have a Copilot, their personalized AI agent, and
then they will use that Copilot to interface and interact with the sea
of AI agents that will be out there.”</p>
<p>Tech giants are facing investor pressure to show returns on their
significant AI investments. Microsoft’s shares fell 2.8% in the
September quarter, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, but remain more than
10% higher for the year.</p>
<p>Some concerns have risen in recent months about the pace of Copilot
adoption, with research firm Gartner saying in August its survey of 152
IT organizations showed that the vast majority had not progressed their
Copilot initiatives past the pilot stage.</p>

id="thelma-mothershed-wair-member-of-little-rock-nine-who-integrated-arkansas-school-has-died">Thelma
Mothershed Wair, member of Little Rock Nine who integrated Arkansas
school, has died</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Thelma Mothershed Wair, one of the nine Black students who integrated
a high school in Arkansas’ capital city of Little Rock in 1957 while a
mob of white segregationists yelled threats and insults, has died at age
83.</p>
<p>Mothershed Wair died Saturday at a hospital in Little Rock after
having complications from multiple sclerosis, her sister, Grace Davis,
confirmed Sunday to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The students who integrated Central High School were known as the
Little Rock Nine.</p>
<p>For three weeks in September 1957, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus used
the National Guard to block the Black students from enrolling in Central
High, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregated
classrooms were unconstitutional. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent
members of the Army’s 101st Airborne Division to escort the students
into school on Sept. 25, 1957.</p>
<p>Davis said she was enrolled at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville when her sister and the other students — Minnijean Brown,
Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence
Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls — integrated Central High
School.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think anybody was really going to hurt her because, you
know, we’ve had racial incidents in Little Rock over the years,” Davis
said of her sister. “People would say things that were mean, but they
never really hurt anybody.”</p>
<p>Davis said in the years that followed she and her sister spoke about
the experience.</p>
<p>“I think one time somebody put some ink on her skirt or something
when she was coming through the hallway. And, of course, there was
always name-calling,” Davis said. “But she never really had any physical
confrontations with any of the students up there.”</p>
<p>Faubus closed all of the schools in Little Rock in 1958 to try to
avoid further integration. Mothershed went out of state to finish her
remaining high school classes. The academic credits transferred back to
Little Rock, and she ultimately earned her diploma from Central High
School.</p>
<p>“She was always a fighter,” Davis said of her sister. “She’s been
sick her entire life. She was born with a congenital heart defect and
was told at an early age that she would never get out of her teens. So
as she approached her 16th birthday, I remember Mother talking about how
afraid she was because she thought she was going to die. But she did
what she wanted to do. She enjoyed life.”</p>
<p>Mothershed earned a bachelor’s degree in home economics education
from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and a master’s degree in
guidance and counseling from Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville.</p>
<p>Mothershed married Fred Wair in 1965. The couple have one son, Scott;
two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2005,
and Mothershed Wair moved back to Little Rock, Davis said.</p>
<p>According to the National Park Service, Mothershed Wair worked in the
East St. Louis, Illinois, school system for 10 years as a home economics
teacher and for 18 years as a counselor for elementary career education
before retiring in 1994. She also worked at the Juvenile Detention
Center of the St. Clair County Jail in Illinois, and was an instructor
of survival skills for women at the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>Each member of the Little Rock Nine was awarded a Congressional Gold
Medal, and they donated them to the William J. Clinton Presidential
Library and Museum in Little Rock in 2011.</p>

Canadian navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait week after China war
games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — A U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed through the
sensitive Taiwan Strait together Sunday less than a week after China
conducted a new round of war games around the island, with Beijing
denouncing the mission as “disruptive.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied
countries, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims
Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to
it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet said Monday that the destroyer USS Higgins
and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver made a “routine” transit Sunday
“through waters where high-seas freedom of navigation and overflight
apply in accordance with international law.”</p>
<p>The transit demonstrated the United States’ and Canada’s commitment
to upholding freedom of navigation for all countries, it said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“The international community’s navigational rights and freedoms in
the Taiwan Strait should not be limited. The United States rejects any
assertion of sovereignty or jurisdiction that is inconsistent with
freedoms of navigations, overflight, and other lawful uses of the sea
and air,” it said.</p>
<p>China’s Eastern Theater Command said its forces monitored and warned
the ships.</p>
<p>“The actions of the United States and Canada caused trouble and are
disruptive to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” it
added.</p>
<p>China staged war-games last Monday it said were a warning to
“separatist acts” and which drew condemnation from the Taiwanese and
U.S. governments.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims saying only
the island’s people can decide their future.</p>

US Navy aviators declared dead after fighter jet crashed in Washington
state</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mount Rainier National Park, Washington — Two crew members who were
missing following the crash of a fighter jet in mountainous terrain in
Washington during a routine training flight have been declared dead, the
U.S. Navy said Sunday.</p>
<p>The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed
east of Mount Rainier on Tuesday afternoon, according to Whidbey Island
Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S
helicopter, immediately launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find
the crew and crash site.</p>
<p>Army Special Forces soldiers trained in mountaineering, high-angle
rescue and technical communications were brought in to reach the
wreckage, which was located Wednesday by an aerial crew resting at about
1,828 meters (6,000 feet) in a remote, steep and heavily wooded area
east of Mount Rainier, officials said.</p>
<p>Locating the missing crew members “as quickly and as safely as
possible” had been their priority, Capt. David Ganci, commander,
Electronic Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet, said Thursday.</p>
<p>The aviators’ names won’t be released until a day after their next of
kin have been notified, the Navy wrote in a press release Sunday, adding
that search and rescue efforts have shifted into a long-term salvage and
recovery operation as the cause of the crash is still being
investigated.</p>
<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we share the loss of two beloved
Zappers,” said Cmdr. Timothy Warburton, commanding officer of the
aviators’ Electronic Attack Squadron, in the press release.</p>
<p>“Our priority right now is taking care of the families of our fallen
aviators. … We are grateful for the ongoing teamwork to safely recover
the deceased.” Ganci said they could not identify the missing crew until
24 hours after their families had been notified of their status.</p>
<p>The crash remains under investigation.</p>
<p>The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and
includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler
squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine
Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.</p>
<p>The “Zappers” were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower.</p>
<p>The search took place near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano
that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round.</p>
<p>The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island
in 2008. In the past 15 years, the Growler has operated around the globe
supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in
front and an electronics operator behind them.</p>
<p>“The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced
technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy’s first
line of defense in hostile environments,” the Navy said on its website.
Each aircraft costs about $67 million.</p>
<p>Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and
sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths.</p>
<p>In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air
Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in
New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>
<p>Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service
members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in
crashed off the coast of Japan.</p>

of the last Navajo Code Talkers from World War II dies at 107</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — John Kinsel Sr., one of the last remaining
Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages during World War II based
on the tribe’s native language, has died. He was 107. </p>
<p>Navajo Nation officials in Window Rock announced Kinsel’s death on
Saturday. </p>
<p>Tribal President Buu Nygren has ordered all flags on the reservation
to be flown at half-staff until Oct. 27 at sunset to honor Kinsel. </p>
<p>“Mr. Kinsel was a Marine who bravely and selflessly fought for all of
us in the most terrifying circumstances with the greatest responsibility
as a Navajo Code Talker,” Nygren said in a statement Sunday. </p>
<p>With Kinsel’s death, only two original Navajo Code Talkers are still
alive: Former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and Thomas H. Begay. </p>
<p>Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the Marines to serve as Code
Talkers during the war, transmitting messages based on their
then-unwritten native language.</p>
<p>They confounded Japanese military cryptologists during World War II
and participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from
1942 to 1945, including at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo
Jima. </p>
<p>The Code Talkers sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese
troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to
the war’s ultimate outcome. </p>
<p>Kinsel was born in Cove, Arizona, and lived in the Navajo community
of Lukachukai. </p>
<p>He enlisted in the Marines in 1942 and became an elite Code Talker,
serving with the 9th Marine Regiment and the 3rd Marine Division during
the Battle of Iwo Jima. </p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan established Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982
and the Aug. 14 holiday honors all the tribes associated with the war
effort. </p>
<p>The day is an Arizona state holiday and Navajo Nation holiday on the
vast reservation that occupies portions of northeastern Arizona,
northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.</p>

writer Anne Applebaum calls for arms for Ukraine, accepts German peace
prize</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WARSAW, Poland — The prominent American journalist and historian Anne
Applebaum urged continued support for Ukraine as she accepted a
prestigious German prize Sunday, arguing that pacifism in the face of
aggression is often nothing more than appeasement.</p>
<p>Applebaum made her appeal to an audience in Frankfurt, where she was
awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. She was joined by her
husband, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who like his wife is a
strong voice on the international stage for supporting Ukraine as it
defends itself against Russia’s brutal invasion.</p>
<p>“If there is even a small chance that military defeat could help end
this horrific cult of violence in Russia, just as military defeat once
brought an end to the cult of violence in Germany, we should take it,”
Applebaum said.</p>
<p>Many Germans have embraced an ethos of pacifism because of their
nation’s aggression under Adolf Hitler during World War II. And many
have misgivings now about supplying weapons to Kyiv, fearing Russia and
worried that it could cause the war to spread beyond Ukraine’s borders
to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>“Some even call for peace by referring solemnly to the ’lessons of
German history,” Applebaum noted, according to a transcript of her
speech published by the prize organization.</p>
<p>“As I am here today accepting a peace prize, this seems the right
moment to point out that ‘I want peace’ is not always a moral argument,”
Applebaum said. “This is also the right moment to say that the lesson of
German history is not that Germans should be pacifists.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, we have known for nearly a century that a demand
for pacifism in the face of an aggressive, advancing dictatorship can
simply represent the appeasement and acceptance of that
dictatorship.”</p>
<p>She argued that the “real lesson” from German history should be that
Germans “have a special responsibility to stand up for freedom and to
take risks in doing so.”</p>
<p>The prize, which is endowed with $27,185, was awarded in St. Paul’s
Church in Frankfurt — which is considered the birthplace of German
parliamentary democracy — at the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair.</p>
<p>The prize has been awarded since 1950. It honors individuals who have
contributed to turning the idea of peace into reality through
literature, science or art. Last year’s prize was awarded to
British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie for his perseverance despite
enduring decades of threats and violence.</p>
<p>The German news agency dpa reported that Applebaum’s strong support
for continuing to arm Ukraine triggered some criticism, citing Karin
Schmidt-Friderichs, the head of the German Publishers and Booksellers
Association, which awards the prize.</p>
<p>Nonetheless she received strong applause for her speech, dpa reported
from Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Following pacifism to its logical conclusion, Applebaum argued, would
“mean that we should acquiesce to the military conquest of Ukraine, to
the cultural destruction of Ukraine, to the construction of
concentration camps in Ukraine, to the kidnapping of children in
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Applebaum writes for The Atlantic magazine. She has written books
that focus on totalitarianism in Eastern Europe, including “The Gulag,”
and “The Iron Curtain” and “Red Famine,” about dictator Joseph Stalin’s
war on Ukraine. She recently published “Autocracy, Inc. The Dictators
Who Want to Run the World.” In 2004, she was awarded the prestigious
Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>The prize jury said Applebaum’s analyses of communist and
post-communist systems in the Soviet Union and Russia reveal “the
mechanisms by which authoritarians grab hold of power and maintain their
control.”</p>
<p>The laudation for Applebaum was delivered by the Russian historian
Irina Scherbakova, a founding member of the human rights organization
Memorial, which is now banned in Russia and was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2022.</p>

officials envision turning Fifth Avenue into grand boulevard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Manhattan’s famed luxury store row Fifth Avenue is in line
for a major makeover.</p>
<p>New York City officials unveiled a plan last week to transform a
central portion of the thoroughfare between Bryant Park and Central Park
into a more pedestrian-centered boulevard.</p>
<p>They propose doubling the size of sidewalks, reducing traffic lanes
from five to three, as well as adding seating areas and hundreds of
trees and planters, among other improvements.</p>
<p>The vision is to emulate iconic strolling and shopping boulevards
such as the Champs-Élysées in Paris.</p>
<p>“As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of one of the most famous
streets in the world, New Yorkers can look forward to a brand-new Fifth
Avenue that will return the street to its former glory as a pedestrian
boulevard,” Madelyn Wils, interim president of the Fifth Avenue
Association, which runs the local business improvement district, said in
a statement. “Reversing the century-old trend of putting cars first,
this visionary design will transform our overcrowded avenue into a
spacious and green corridor for shoppers and workers, visitors and New
Yorkers, and everyone on Fifth.”</p>
<p>The plan would cost more than $350 million and be paid through a mix
of public and private financing, according to Mayor Eric Adams’
administration and the Future of Fifth Partnership.</p>
<p>Officials said the project represents the avenue’s first major
redesign and could pay for itself in less than five years through
increased property and sales tax revenue.</p>
<p>But some transit advocates have voiced concerns, saying the plan does
not give enough consideration to the needs of the public bus system or
the city’s many cyclists.</p>
<p>A public meeting will be held later this month on the plan, and
construction could begin in 2028.</p>
<p>Officials say Fifth Avenue is roughly 100 feet wide, with just two
23-foot sidewalks, even though pedestrians make up 70% of all traffic on
the corridor.</p>
<p>Some 5,500 pedestrians traverse its blocks on average each hour, a
number that swells to 23,000 people an hour during the holidays,
officials said.</p>
<p>“People across the globe identify Fifth Avenue as a premier
destination for strolling and shopping,” Meera Joshi, the city’s deputy
mayor for operations, said in a statement. “But its larger-than-life
reputation means that its sidewalks have reached their capacity, hosting
more people per hour in peak seasons than Madison Square Garden.”</p>
<p>The Fifth Avenue plan was among other ambitious plans for roadways
city officials revealed [last] week.</p>
<p>They also proposed capping stretches of the Cross Bronx Expressway, a
major highway that cuts through the borough of the Bronx.</p>
<p>City officials said the proposals would build parks and greenspaces
atop the covered highway, helping restore urban neighborhoods hollowed
out by the expansion of the national highway system and the development
of suburbs.</p>
<p>“This is a historic opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and
reconnect communities once again,” Joshi said.</p>

Oscar makes landfall in eastern Cuba after striking Bahamas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami, florida — Hurricane Oscar has made landfall in eastern Cuba,
an island beleaguered by a massive power outage, after striking the
southeastern Bahamas earlier in the day Sunday, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>The hurricane center in Miami said the storm’s center arrived in the
Cuban province of Guantanamo, near the city of Baracoa, on Sunday
evening. Its maximum sustained winds were near 130 km/h (80 mph).</p>
<p>The system is expected to move across eastern Cuba Sunday night and
Monday. Forecasters said 15.2 to 30.5 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of
rain are expected across eastern Cuba through early Wednesday, with some
isolated locations getting up to 45.72 centimeters (18 inches). A storm
surge of up to 0.91 meters (3 feet) in some areas of Cuba’s north shore
in the area was possible, the center said.</p>
<p>Oscar was expected to weaken over eastern Cuba before making a turn
to the northeast and approaching the central Bahamas on Tuesday, the
center said.</p>
<p>The storm’s center was located about 10 kilometers (5 miles)
east-southeast of Baracoa, or about 80 kilometers (50 miles)
east-northeast of Guantanamo. It was heading west-southwest at 11 km/h
(7 mph).</p>
<p>Oscar made landfall on Great Inagua island in the Bahamas earlier
Sunday. It was expected to produce a dangerous storm surge that could
translate into significant coastal flooding there and in other areas of
the southeastern Bahamas. Five to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) of
rainfall were expected, with isolated areas seeing up to 15.2
centimeters (6 inches).</p>
<p>The hurricane’s arrival comes as Cuba tries to recover from its worst
blackout in at least two years, which left millions without power for
two days last week. Some electrical service was restored Saturday.</p>
<p>Philippe Papin of the National Hurricane Center said it was somewhat
unexpected that Oscar became a hurricane Saturday.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the system kind of snuck up a little bit on us,” Papin
said.</p>
<p>Hours earlier Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico’s southern
Caribbean coast. It degenerated into a tropical depression as it moved
over land.</p>

<h2 id="whooping-cough-is-at-a-decade-high-level-in-us">Whooping cough
is at a decade-high level in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Whooping cough is at its highest level in a decade for
this time of year, U.S. health officials reported Thursday.</p>
<p>There have been 18,506 cases of whooping cough reported so far, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That’s the most at this
point in the year since 2014, when cases topped 21,800.</p>
<p>The increase is not unexpected — whooping cough peaks every three to
five years, health experts said. And the numbers indicate a return to
levels before the coronavirus pandemic, when whooping cough and other
contagious illnesses plummeted.</p>
<p>Still, the tally has some state health officials concerned, including
those in Wisconsin, where there have been about 1,000 cases so far this
year, compared to a total of 51 last year.</p>
<p>Nationwide, CDC has reported that kindergarten vaccination rates
dipped last year and vaccine exemptions are at an all-time high.
Thursday, it released state figures, showing that about 86% of
kindergartners in Wisconsin got the whooping cough vaccine, compared to
more than 92% nationally.</p>
<p>Whooping cough, also called pertussis, usually starts out like a
cold, with a runny nose and other common symptoms, before turning into a
prolonged cough. It is treated with antibiotics. Whooping cough used to
be very common until a vaccine was introduced in the 1950s, which is now
part of routine childhood vaccinations. It is in a shot along with
tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The combo shot is recommended for
adults every 10 years.</p>
<p>“They used to call it the 100-day cough because it literally lasts
for 100 days,” said Joyce Knestrick, a family nurse practitioner in
Wheeling, West Virginia.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is usually seen mostly in infants and young children,
who can develop serious complications. That’s why the vaccine is
recommended during pregnancy, to pass along protection to the newborn,
and for those who spend a lot of time with infants.</p>
<p>But public health workers say outbreaks this year are hitting older
kids and teens. In Pennsylvania, most outbreaks have been in middle
school, high school and college settings, an official said. Nearly all
the cases in Douglas County, Nebraska, are schoolkids and teens, said
Justin Frederick, deputy director of the health department.</p>
<p>That includes his own teenage daughter.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible disease. She still wakes up — after being treated
with her antibiotics — in a panic because she’s coughing so much she
can’t breathe,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s important to get tested and treated with antibiotics early, said
Dr. Kris Bryant, who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at
Norton Children’s in Louisville, Kentucky. People exposed to the
bacteria can also take antibiotics to stop the spread.</p>
<p>“Pertussis is worth preventing,” Bryant said. “The good news is that
we have safe and effective vaccines.”</p>

<h2 id="many-schools-are-still-closed-weeks-after-hurricane-helene">Many
schools are still closed weeks after Hurricane Helene</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of students in the Southeast are dealing with
school disruptions after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc so severe — on
homes, campuses and municipal power and water systems — that some
districts have no idea when they will reopen.</p>
<p>While virtual learning helped during the COVID-19 school closures,
that has not been an option for this crisis because internet and
cellphone service has remained spotty since the storm struck in late
September.</p>
<p>In hard-hit western North Carolina, some districts warn students will
miss up to a month of school, and others say they can’t yet determine a
timeline for returning to classrooms.</p>
<p>“I feel like a month is a lot, but it’s not something that can’t be
overcome,” said Marissa Coleman, who has sent her four children to stay
with grandparents in Texas because their home in North Carolina’s
Buncombe County has no running water. “But if we get further into
Thanksgiving and Christmas, it’s like, how are they actually going to
make this up?”</p>
<p>In mountainous Buncombe County, Helene swept away homes, cut power
and destroyed crucial parts of the water system for Asheville, a city of
about 94,000 people. The storm decimated remote towns and killed at
least 246 people throughout the Appalachians, where massive cleanup
efforts have been complicated by washed-out bridges and roads. It was
the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in
2005.</p>
<p>The Buncombe County School system, which serves over 22,000 students,
told families Tuesday on the district’s Facebook page no decision has
been made “with regards to start date or length of day” because of a
need to repair buildings, restore phone and security systems and redraw
bus routes.</p>
<p>Even when schools reopen, educators worry the disruption could have
profound effects on students’ learning and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Children who experience natural disasters are more prone to acute
illness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, research shows. The
physical and mental health impacts put them at greater risk of learning
loss: Absences can undermine achievement, as can the effects of trauma
on brain function.</p>
<p>The challenges come amid growing concerns about the impacts of
climate change on students. Wildfires have swept through communities,
displacing families. Many school systems with inadequate heating or air
conditioning have closed during extreme weather or forced students and
educators to endure sweltering or frigid temperatures. According to the
World Bank, 400 million children lost school days because of
“climate-related closures” in 2022.</p>
<p>Days after Helene made landfall, Hurricane Milton roared ashore last
week farther south along the same Florida coast as a Category 3 storm.
While about half the state’s districts were closed, all of them were
planning to reopen by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Schools affected by Helene are trying to provide stability. The
Buncombe district has suggested parents trade books with neighbors and
friends for their kids. “Have them write, maybe about something they’re
looking forward to when school starts again,” the district told parents
on social media. “Turn everyday experiences into math problems.”</p>
<p>Cécile Wight, a mother of two in Asheville, said she has been
grateful for concern shown by schools including surveys checking on
families’ well-being and an elementary school bus driver who took his
own car to visit each child on his route.</p>
<p>“That has been huge, just having the emotional support from the
school system and from the people we know at the school,” she said.</p>
<p>But uncertainty remains. Wight said her family is able to stay at
their home because they have well water, but many other families have
yet to return since evacuating. Most of Buncombe’s 45 schools still
lacked running water as of Tuesday, meaning they’re unable to meet basic
safety and hygiene standards.</p>
<p>Schools have begun exploring whether it would be possible to open
without running water, relying on portable bathroom trailers. In a
letter to families, Asheville Superintendent Maggie Furman said the
district is considering drilling wells at each school so they don’t have
to rely on city water.</p>
<p>Coleman said her kids are eager for some kind of normalcy.</p>
<p>“I understand the schools are going to have to take some time to find
a way to open safely, and I support that 100%. But I definitely am not
in the camp of ‘We need to wait until we get water back, until
everything’s normal again to open.’ I just think that’s going to be too
long,” Coleman said.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Education is still trying to determine
how many schools remain closed since Hurricane Helene and how many took
too much damage to reopen.</p>
<p>Echoing the COVID-19 pandemic, several schools in Tennessee have
postponed traditions like homecoming games, parades and dances. Many
colleges are also granting extensions on application deadlines,
officials say, to reduce high school seniors’ stress.</p>
<p>In storm-drenched areas elsewhere, some early education providers may
never reopen.</p>
<p>Private child care and preschool centers are particularly vulnerable
in the aftermath of a natural disaster, said Militza Mezquita, senior
adviser for education in emergencies at Save the Children. Many already
operate on thin margins, meaning a temporary closure can easily turn
permanent. As for-profit companies, they are also ineligible for many
types of disaster aid. A natural disaster can wipe out 10% to 20% of
providers, Mezquita said.</p>
<p>“Child care recovery is very critical to the whole recovery
ecosystem,” Mezquita said, noting the people essential to recovery —
road workers, cleanup crews, doctors and nurses — often have young
children that need to be looked after. “If they are not able to
adequately get their children in care, they can’t go to work.”</p>
<p>Despite the instability, educators like Heather Smith, who was named
North Carolina’s Teacher of the Year in the spring, encourage families
to see the lessons storms can provide. Smith brought along her two
children, ages 8 and 4, to serve meals at her church.</p>
<p>“Our kids are learning so much every day, whether it’s about
adversity, whether it’s about helping a community,” said Smith, who rode
out the storm at her home in Waynesville.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wight has been taking her children to volunteer for relief
efforts at a school. She said it has helped them feel active and
involved in the community.</p>
<p>“If COVID taught us something, it’s that we can make things work. The
kids are resilient,” Wight said. “They will eventually catch up on the
academic side of things.”</p>

Mary J. Blige, Ozzy Osbourne among Rock Hall of Fame inductees</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Cher, Mary J. Blige and Ozzy Osbourne were among this
year’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, an elite group formally
introduced into the music pantheon Saturday at a star-studded concert
gala.</p>
<p>Kool &amp; the Gang, Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, A Tribe Called
Quest, and Peter Frampton round out the 2024 class of honorees, artists
honored at the ceremony held in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the prestigious
hall.</p>
<p>Big Mama Thornton, Alexis Korner and John Mayall received special
honors for “musical influence,” as Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick
and Norman Whitfield received awards for “musical excellence.”</p>
<p>Suzanne de Passe, a trailblazer for women executives in the music
business, who was big in Motown, won the night’s award for nonperforming
industry professionals.</p>
<p>Dua Lipa kicked off the evening with a performance of Believe, with
Cher joining the pop star onstage to finish her 1998 smash hit, which
was credited as the first song to use auto-tune technology as an
instrument.</p>
<p>“I changed the sound of music forever,” she said in her acceptance
speech, less than a year after railing against the hall for not having
yet added her to the ballot.</p>
<p>“It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was getting in
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,” she quipped Saturday night.</p>
<p>Performers included Kelly Clarkson, Sammy Hagar, Slash and Demi
Lovato, who all appeared for Foreigner.</p>
<p>A group of artists including Queen Latifah, De La Soul and Busta
Rhymes also performed with the surviving members of the eclectic,
pioneering hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest – Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed
Muhammad and Jarobi White.</p>

probes unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack
plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is investigating an unauthorized
release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack
Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S.
official said the documents appear to be legitimate.</p>
<p>The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence
Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel was still
moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response
to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on October 1. They were
sharable within the “Five Eyes,” which are the U.S., Great Britain,
Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted to the
Telegram messaging app and first reported by CNN and Axios. The
officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
<p>The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained —
including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S.
intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and
whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the
officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to
determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the
official said.</p>
<p>The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of
Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza, and has
likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military
operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war.
However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let
Iran’s missile attack go unanswered.</p>
<p>Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by
the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the
documents but did not have further comment.</p>
<p>The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to
the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has
killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women
and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military
says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters.</p>
<p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for
comment over the leak of the two documents.</p>
<p>The documents first appeared online Friday via a channel on Telegram,
claiming they had been leaked by someone in the U.S. intelligence
community, then later the U.S. Defense Department. The information
appeared entirely gathered through the use of satellite image
analysis.</p>
<p>One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from
the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack
Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to
leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on
Ukraine and other national security secrets.</p>
<p>The Telegram channel involved in the leak identifies itself as being
based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of
Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance,” which includes Middle East
militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic.</p>

dead after ferry dock gangway collapses on Georgia’s Sapelo Island</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAVANNAH, Georgia — At least seven people were killed Saturday after
part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgia’s Sapelo Island, authorities
said.</p>
<p>Multiple people were taken to hospitals, and crews from the U.S.
Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to
spokesperson Tyler Jones of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources,
which operates the dock.</p>
<p>Jones said a gangway at the dock collapsed and sent people plunging
into the water. It happened as crowds gathered on the island for a
celebration of its tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave
descendants.</p>
<p>“There have been seven fatalities confirmed,” Jones said. “There have
been multiple people transported to area hospitals, and we are
continuing to search the water for individuals.”</p>
<p>Jones said he did not know what caused the gangway to collapse, but
officials believe there were at least 20 people on it at the time. The
gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another
dock onshore.</p>
<p>Among the dead was a chaplain for the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources, Jones said.</p>
<p>Sapelo Island is about 97 kilometers south of Savannah and is
reachable from the mainland by boat.</p>
<p>Cultural Day is an annual fall event spotlighting the island’s tiny
community of Hogg Hummock, which is home to a few dozen Black residents.
The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded by former
slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.</p>
<p>Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the
South — known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia — are scattered along the
coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from
the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage,
from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing
and weaving baskets.</p>
