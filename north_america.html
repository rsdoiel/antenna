      <h1>Big banks post big earnings, but lending is more muted</h1>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>It’s a big week for bank earnings. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported quarterly results on Tuesday; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag. We'll unpack. Also on the show: a major cryptocurrency scam and the economics of Broadway contract negotiations.</p>

      <h1>A conversation with Nobel laureate Joel Mokyr</h1>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>Joel Mokyr is a professor at Northwestern University, who — along with Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt — won the Nobel prize in economics earlier this week. Today, Mokyr joins the program to discuss how major technological changes can boost economic growth — that is, if politics and institutions can adapt quickly enough. Plus, why the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings are raising questions about private credit markets and big banks’ exposure to them.</p>

      <h1>Greece decides on a 13-hour working day</h1>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Greece's government is voting on a bill authorizing private sector employees to work up to 13 hours a day, if both employee and employer agree. Labor unions have called mass strikes in protest, paralyzing the public sector. This comes as Greece faces high debt, rising inflation, and lower wages than much of the European Union. Plus, Japan is holding its biggest-ever technology trade show, centered on integrating AI into our daily lives.</p>

      <p>Before the government shutdown, the Federal Communications Commission voted to end funding for Wi-Fi on school buses and the lending of hotspot devices from libraries.

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Amid all the anxiety, uncertainty and flip-flopping in this economy, one sector is doing tremendously: Big banks. Recent earnings reports showed banks including Citibank and JPMorgan beat revenue expectations and grew at a clip over the past few months. In this episode, why banks are thriving as regulations loosen and the economy gets unpredictable. Plus: A growing share of small businesses are raising prices in response to tariffs, Microsoft stopped updating Windows 10, and battery makers weigh pivot from EVs to grid storage.</p>

      <h1>When the government shuts down, tribal communities get the shaft</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab. Marketplace’s Savannah Peters joins Kimberly to explain how tribal communities get caught up in the federal government’s dysfunctional budget process and why tribal leaders argue this needs to change.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>

(date: 2025-10-13)
      <p>
      <p>In another wave of tariff news, Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese goods that will take effect in November. The constant back and forth of tariff policy has left import-reliant business owners frustrated, defeated and wondering how long they can hold out.

      <p>
      <p>Marketplace doesn’t always cover the goings-on of the Holy See. But when he highlights the need to combat poverty, it seems like a pretty good time to do so. In his first teaching last week, Pope Leo XIV called into question some basic tenets of mainstream economics and focused on the gap between the rich and the poor. Today, we discuss. Also on the show: the research of Nobel laureate economists and Trump's attempts to calm markets over China trade.</p>

China has warned of &quot;corresponding measures,&quot; though new data shows that China’s exports are booming. So does China still need the U.S.?

      <p>Open AI has added a checkout feature to ChatGPT, partnering with Etsy and Shopify to let users purchase some items from select merchants. OpenAI says ChatGPT's answers are still organic and unsponsored. But why not offer a seamless way to buy things that come up in certain responses?</p>
<p>Eventually this could lead to so-called “agentic” shopping: letting AI research items, pick one, and then buy it on our behalf. Marketplace's Nova Safo spoke with colleague Meghan McCarty Carino about what AI companies stand to gain from integrating e-commerce tech.</p>

      <h1>Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100% tariff on Chinese imports</h1>

(date: 2025-10-11)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump threatened to place an additional 100% tax on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1 or sooner, potentially escalating tariff rates close to levels that in April fanned fears of a recession.</p>

      <p>Wanna put a wager on, well, just about anything? Try a prediction market. Competing industry giants Kalshi and Polymarket both saw major investment this week, and for good reason. Though they don’t look it on paper, both function as (extremely lucrative) sports betting platforms but don't face the regulations of sports betting platforms. In this episode, we bet on where that legal loophole is headed. Plus: Expect car sales to sputter as the EV tax credit ends and tariffs drive up costs, and the case for replacing subsidized air travel with a more robust rural bus system.</p>

      <h1>Why government shutdowns hit tribes especially hard</h1>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>Federal programs and funding play an important role in Indian Country, because of the government’s trust responsibility to provide or fund services to tribal nations in exchange for ceded land that now comprises the United States. That relationship also means that shutdowns hit tribal nations particularly hard. We'll learn what that means for services like health care and food distribution programs. Then, a lifelong Las Vegas resident reflects on the city's economic slowdown.</p>

      <h1>Could airport slowdowns end the shutdown?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

      <h1>Using tariffs to help farmers ... harmed by tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

      <h1>Gold prices surge to a new record</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Gold has breached $4,000 an ounce for the first time, following one of its strongest monthly performances and its biggest sustained rally since the 1970s. What's driving the surge? Then, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is attending a two-day summit in India focused on trade, but he's insisting the U.K. won't issue more visas to Indian workers. Also on the show: Trump's &quot;gold card&quot; visas and newly minted billionaire soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

      <h1>AI "workslop" is hurting coworker dynamics</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true.

      <p>OpenAI announced it will invest big time in chipmaker AMD, potentially in exchange for a stake in the firm. As AI investment has ramped up, similar deals have become common. Do these partnerships signal a strengthening sector? Or are they a symptom of an AI bubble headed toward a burst?

      <p>Over the weekend, the White House threatened more layoffs if negotiations between Democrats and Republicans continue to go nowhere. Meanwhile, 100,000 earlier federal layoffs and buyouts finally took effect last week. But stocks hit a record on Friday. What gives? We'll discuss with Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. Plus, a lack of trust in artificial intelligence is hampering its adoption among small and mid-sized businesses.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Nikkei 225 stock index in Japan rose sharply on the first day of trading after Sanae Takaichi won the contest to lead the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Then, Jaguar Land Rover plans to resume vehicle production in the U.K. today, six weeks after a cyberattack forced a production pause. And, although the artificial intelligence industry is worth close to $250 billion, some businesses are rejecting its use altogether. We'll hear from them.</p>

On the show today, The Brookings Institution’s Molly Reynolds joins Kimberly to explain how shutdowns became Congress’ political weapon of choice and why the federal budget process has gotten even more complicated under the Trump administration. Plus, we hear from you, our dear listeners.</p>

      <h1>First came the shutdown, next the layoffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>Federal worker layoffs are near, according to Trump administration officials. Earlier this week, the president said he would use the government shutdown to target &quot;Democrat things.&quot; And a shutdown with layoffs may have more serious economic consequences than your average shutdown. For more on that we turn to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. Also on today's show: China launches a new visa to attract more international STEM talent.</p>

      <h1>As the labor market cools, job scams heat up</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>Unemployment remains relatively low, but the labor market is slowing down. Private payroll company ADP estimates the private sector lost 32,000 jobs last month. Hiring has slowed, and it's taking longer for jobseekers to find work. And where there are people with anxiety and fear, there are scammers to prey on them. The Federal Trade Commission says reports of job scams tripled over the past four years. But first, why the Trump administration is sending memos to universities and what Democrats are demanding to reopen the government.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Some European Union countries have backed plans for the new defense system to keep out unmanned aircraft from Russia. But how will it work, and what's the price tag? In France hundreds of thousands of workers have walked out over looming budget cuts and pension reforms. Today marks the 75th anniversary of The Turing Test, to tell the difference between a human and a machine. And we hear how Chilean businesses are adapting — or not — to an ageing workforce.</p>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The government shutdown means crucial jobs data will likely be postponed, right as the Fed weighs its next move. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a self-described “data dog,” tells us how central bank officials plan to pivot. He also discusses Fed independence, transitory inflation, and rate cut pacing. After that: fiscal calendars vary by sector, synthetic dye removal will ripple through the food chain, and ADP reports more sour employment data.</p>

      <p>Markets are having to digest a lot right now. There's the government shutdown, plus new private payroll data showing the economy lost jobs in September. Susan Schmidt, portfolio manager at Exchange Capital Resources, joins us to break it down. Also on the show: the FAFSA portal is open. We look at what's different with this year's federal student aid applications and how the government shutdown could impact the process.

      <p>The slow-moving train wreck we've been watching unfold for a week, has indeed wrecked: the government officially shutdown at midnight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed, and the Trump administration is threatening to fire others. Later in the show, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour sits down with Susan M. Collins, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. They'll discuss tariffs, a cooling labor market and how the central bank is affected by a government shutdown.</p>

      <p>While the stock market appears unconcerned about potential red flags in this economy, the bond market's a bit more cautious. As Washington nears a shutdown and the labor market flags, Treasury yields are ticking down. But demand for those safer, long-term bonds hasn’t been uniform. Plus: Trump adds to existing tariffs on Canadian lumber, OpenAI wades into e-commerce waters, and Abha Bhattarai at the Washington Post talks about the “stuck economy.”</p>

      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry. Higher education also uses the H-1B visa, and that fee could be a big problem there. Brendan Cantwell, a professor at Michigan State University, unpacks what these changes mean for universities. But first, Dr. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds joins us to discuss President Trump's latest tariffs.</p>

Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool.

      <h1>From "How We Survive": The climate crisis is an economic crisis</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing a special bonus episode from “How We Survive.” It’s a conversation between host Amy Scott, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Elizabeth Kolbert. Together, they dig into how the climate crisis is triggering economic disruption. Plus, some solutions to be hopeful about.</p>
<p>And, we get a peek into Kolbert’s forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/781145/life-on-a-little-known-planet-by-elizabeth-kolbert/">”Life on a Little-Known Planet: Dispatches from a Changing World.”</a> In this collection of her most influential essays, Kolbert takes readers around the globe, telling stories about caterpillars, whale conversations and the people trying to preserve our planet.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded live, over Zoom, in front of an audience. You can watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5QiojlV640">here</a>. The event is presented by Odoo with additional underwriting support from The Economist.</p>

      <h1>On the brink of a shutdown, markets don't care</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump and congressional leaders are meeting at the White House on Monday to try and avoid a government shutdown. But both sides are digging their heels in. This brinksmanship is happening the same week we are set to get some pretty important government data. Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, and a professor at the University of Texas-Austin, joins us to talk about it. Plus, has Canada lost its trade dispute with the U.S.?</p>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Texas oil and gas firms are feeling pessimistic about the upcoming year. In the latest Dallas Fed survey, energy firms reported lower production, increased costs and heightened uncertainty. Oil is a good chunk of the Texas economy, and the Texas economy is a good chunk of the U.S. economy — around 9%. Also on the show: auto parts manufacturer First Brands files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the USDA revives its farm-to-school grant program.</p>

      <p>Researchers at several universities tested how successful artificial intelligence can be at political persuasion, and found some AI chatbots were 40-50% more successful than a static message at getting people to change their views. And those views often stayed changed weeks later.</p>

      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row. Thanks to tariff-induced price bumps, consumers are dipping into savings and using credit cards to keep up with their typical spending. In this episode, how long can consumers stay resilient?

      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more. And later, we'll learn why so much foreign investment is still flowing to the U.S.</p>

That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more.

Chains like Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are all trying to cash in — in part by offering fancier, pricier, non-alcoholic drinks. Also on the program, we'll check in on New England's economy.</p>

      <h1>Warnings of permanent layoffs in case of shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p>The Office of Management and Budget sent out a memo with stark instructions for heads of federal agencies: They should consider layoff notices for all employees in programs that haven’t been funded yet for the government’s 2026 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. Also on the show: The U.S. is in negotiations to lend $20 billion to Argentina’s central bank, and climate change is treatening New Mexico's centuries-old irrigation system.</p>

      <h1>Apple presses European regulators over tech rules</h1>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Apple has called for the European Union's antitrust watchdogs to scrap some of its tech regulations, which it says lead to a worse experience for users. It's not the first time Apple has voiced its opposition to Europe's Digital Markets Act. We hear more. Plus, China has — for the first time — set a target for reducing carbon emissions. And, a Dutch village famous for its windmills is planning to charge visitors to see them.</p>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p>The EV tax credit expires September 30, and Americans have been rushing to take advantage before the deadline. But according to reporting from Marketplace’s Henry Epp, many dealerships are facing new friction when processing tax credits with the IRS.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Epp about the new IRS requirements and how dealerships are handling the changes.</p>

      <h1>What's with the streaming price hikes?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p>Disney’s streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN — will see price hikes come October 21. They aren’t alone. As the streaming wars escalate, companies have switched focus to profit over customer volume, while consumers whittle down their subscriptions. Also in this episode: A soybean farmer faces trade war realities, manufacturers pour cash into new equipment, and Warren Littlefield, producer of “Fargo,&quot; “The Handmaid’s Tale” and more discusses the TV business with Kai.</p>

      <h1>The next USDA report on hunger in the U.S. will be the last</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p>Every fall for about three decades, the U.S. Department of Agriculture comes out with a report assessing food security across the country. We'll get the latest in a month, but it will be the last. The USDA is terminating the annual report, saying it was “politicized.” Researchers, however, say it was vital. Also on the show: no sure thing on the future of interest rates and the costs for Chinese adoptees to search for their birth family.</p>

      <h1>The Jimmy Kimmel saga, station ownership, and the FCC</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p>After being pulled by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned to TV last night. Thing is, station groups Nexstar and Sinclair — which control ABC affiliates that reach about 20% of the country — opted out. Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners. And later: If Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can’t reach a deal, many federal agencies will close a week from today.</p>

      <h1>Trump's tariffs push Indonesia and the EU to a trade deal</h1>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> After nearly a decade of negotiations, the European Union and Indonesia have agreed to a trade deal, in part to offset some of the effects of Trump's tariffs. Then, Nigeria has cut interest rates for the first time in five years. Plus, India has reduced taxes on everyday items to counteract the effects of U.S. tariffs, and the UK government says it saved around $600 million last year using artificial intelligence to combat fraud.</p>
