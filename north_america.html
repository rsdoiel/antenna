      This past week, AI darling Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results that beat analysts' expectations. But investors weren't impressed and the stock price dropped.

      <p>Core inflation rose to 2.9% in July, according to the latest PCE data <em>— </em>the Fed's preferred inflation gauge <em>— </em>marking its highest level in months. But despite stubborn inflation and falling consumer confidence, consumer spending continues to climb. Courtenay Brown at Axios and Jordyn Holman at The New York Times join "Marketplace" host Amy Scott to talk about the latest inflation numbers, and the court battle brewing between the White House and the Federal Reserve. Also in this episode: the economics of uncertainty, why job-hopping may no longer lead to bigger paychecks, and how "buy now, pay later" is being rebranded to target women.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>We're continuing to follow President Donald Trump's campaign against U.S. central bank independence. His move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud has now been challenged by a lawsuit from Cook. Fed independence has been a strength of the U.S. financial system, but what happens if that disappears? We turn to Hungary as a case study. Plus, consumers spend on tech, and we discuss the latest inflation reading.</p>

Known as the “Magnificent Seven,” they comprise Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla, and are valued at around $20 trillion. Is this a bubble ready to burst? An overvaluation? Or something else entirely? But before we get to that story, we'll learn more about the first court hearing in a case that tests the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

      <p>Three years ago, then-President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, with hopes of giving the U.S. semiconductor industry a boost amid strategic competition with China. Since then, the federal government has been funneling billions into the sector, including STEM education investments. Yet, according to a new study, there’s still a shortage of skilled workers to fill critical chip production jobs. But first, a recent grad reflects on automation in the job-hunting process.</p>

The Fed controls the Federal Funds Rate, which is currently at around 4.5%; the president wants it down to 1%. So, what if that happened? We'll outline the ripple effects.

      <p>You may have heard that big things come in small packages. Now, tariffs do too. The "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases less than $800 ends Friday. Parcels will then be subject to the tariff for whatever country from which they’re shipped. Plus, why Nvidia's quarterly results are a big deal and how a less independent Federal Reserve could affect the value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It's a tough day for India. Most of its exports to the United States will now face a 50% tariff. It's a major shift between the two countries, which used to be partners, especially in tech and defense. We'll learn about the impacts. Plus, European carmakers are claiming that hitting the EU’s 2035 CO2 emissions targets is no longer realistic. Plus, a K-pop-themed musical has become the most-watched movie on Netflix.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month ending the global import tax exemption on small packages worth under $800 entering the U.S. duty-free, a change due to take effect on Friday. Also, Boeing and Korean Air have announced a deal worth $36 billion for over 100 planes.</p>

Markets are eager for a rate cut, but signs of a weaker labor market and uncertainty from tariff and immigration policy are complicating the economic picture. Then, Australia is hoping to ease the rare earths bottleneck after China said it's tightening controls on mining and processing.</p>

      <p>Brinker International, which owns casual dining chain Chili’s, just beat 50-year sales and revenue records. In this fickle economic moment, how’d they do it? The answer involves viral fried mozzarella and the power of young consumers. Also in this episode: Jay Powell hints at rate cuts, AI data centers increase electricity costs for everyone, and automakers swear updated tech, not tariffs, drove up prices.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <h1>A turnaround for manufacturing — can it last?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip? Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <p>The fashion world has the Met Gala. The movies have the Oscars. Central banking has an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech, where economists will be listening for clues on interest rates. But there’s another pressing issue looming over Powell’s speech: a new five-year framework for the Fed's interest rate strategy. We have an explainer. Plus, there's new evidence that first-time homebuyers remain undeterred.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A trade agreement between the United States and the European Union means that U.S. tariffs on imported European goods will be significantly lower than previously thought. The U.S. will cap tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors at 15%. That's a huge decrease from prior threats of levies as high as 250%. Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>

      <p>Rising unemployment claims will be on Fed Chair Jay Powell's mind when he addresses the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, and as he contemplates an interest rate decision in September. But he’s also got stable prices amid tariff uncertainty to worry about. So, we wonder: What Will Jay Powell Do? Later in this episode: Visual AI tools trail behind language-based models, popular spicy snacks could be a symptom of rising food costs, and Indigenous artists tell us how tariffs factor into their business.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>President Donald Trump recently demanded that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook resign after she was accused of mortgage fraud. In a statement, Cook said she has no intention of being "bullied to step down" and that she's "gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions." We'll hear more. Plus, a weakening labor market sets the backdrop for the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference, and Microsoft's AI chief voices concerns about "AI psychosis."</p>

      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak tomorrow in Jackson Hole, and we'll be watching for hints about the future of interest rates. But one tricky part of the inflation equation? Rent. Higher interest rates have kept many would-be homebuyers in the rental market, which boosted overall demand and pushed rents higher. Then, just how stable are stablecoins? We'll provide an update on the state of play in the crypto market.</p>

That’s likely why Starbucks just joined a growing list of companies to shift from merit-based raises to a flat percentage raise. In this episode, why a flat raise structure tends to be cheaper and less time consuming than merit increases — even though everyone gets ‘em.

      <h1>It's quality over low cost for U.S. clothing manufacturing</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>

It also comes as the U.S. government weighs whether to take a direct stake in the company. And, as historic White House talks spark hopes of a Putin–Zelensky summit, the war in Ukraine grinds on, with Russia turning to North Korea to plug major labor gaps.</p>

      <p>New context for the strong-consumer-spending-and-falling-consumer-sentiment combo: According to a Boston Fed report, the proportion of spending done by top-earning U.S. households is growing, and the share spent by lower-income Americans is shrinking. What might that widening gap tells us about the trajectory of this economy? Plus: Strong Q2 corporate earnings are an economic bright spot, U.S. energy exports may not break records again this year, and we investigate who profits from the tripled ICE budget.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>It’s a big week for Fed watchers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at a research conference on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It comes at a tricky time for the Fed — pressures are weighing on both price stability and maximum employment, and there's ire coming from President Donald Trump. We'll discuss what to expect. Plus, global demand for cassava is growing. Can Nigeria capitalize on the moment and become an export giant?</p>

      <p>It’s not just you — we feel the bad vibes in the job market too. On the show today, we’ll unpack how what we’re hearing from those on the job hunt compares to what the data shows about a labor market slump.

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month, claiming that the monthly jobs numbers — which were revised downward — were “rigged” to make him look bad. Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare? Also: a flare of inflation at the wholesale level and a comeback for adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>

      <p>In addition to the many considerations surrounding cost, those who lost homes in this year's California wildfires may also be looking for an environmentally-friendly way to rebuild that's able to withstand the next fire. Today, Marketplace's David Brancaccio explores mass timber, which doesn't burn easily, as an option for home reconstruction. But first, New York’s attorney general is suing the company that runs Zelle, alleging its customers were left open to fraud.</p>

      <p>HBO Max’s “Hacks” often tackles the push and pull between art and profit in the entertainment industry. It’s a topic the show’s creators are deeply familiar with. In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal discusses that tension — as it appears in the show and in real life — with “Hacks” showrunners Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky.

      <p>Since President Trump’s firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over a weak jobs report, we’ve been thinking a lot about the trustworthiness of U.S. economic data.

      <p>Recently, President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after revisions depicted a weaker job market than initially thought. This week, Trump called on the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get rid of his chief economist, after the economist predicted that tariffs would force consumers to pay extra. What should consumers and investors make of this? We'll discuss. And later, we'll hear how French factories are benefiting from increased defense spending.</p>

      <p>Social Security turns 90 tomorrow. Some 74 million Americans receive the benefits, and a new survey shows that 65% of retirees rely on them. Roughly 40% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and this precarity comes at a time when Social Security faces the possibility of benefit cuts. Plus, Trump's tariffs are generating billions in revenue monthly, and Brazil's president announced $5 billion to help smaller companies deal with tariffs.</p>

      <p>Philadelphia, Boston, and Seattle have all experienced strikes by trash collection workers this summer. At their peak, more than 2,000 workers coast to coast walked off the job after contract talks stalled. The Teamsters Union representing the workers says members deserve a pay rise and better health care benefits. We'll hear from the picket line and customers affected. But first, a Texas-based manufacturer reflects on what all this tariff back-and-forth means for business.</p>

This means those massive American tariff hikes — some as high as 145% — have been put on hold, as Beijing was ready to hit back with 125% tariffs. But could another 90 days be enough time to strike a deal? Plus, this summer, several U.S. cities have been gripped by trash collection strikes. We'll hear more.</p>

      <h1>Tariffs muddy the future of the global oil market</h1>

      <p>If President Donald Trump’s tariffs stymie the U.S. economy — which would, in turn, slow the global economy — oil demand will fall. And we're already operating at a surplus. In this episode, why the oil market tea leaves are difficult to read right now. Plus: Trump takes an “unprecedented” hands-on approach to Big Tech business dealings, and tariffs on semiconductors will make electronics more expensive. And, despite a six-year period of steep overall inflation, some prices have dropped. Can you guess which ones?</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>President Trump today said he’s temporarily taking over Washington’s police department and sending in National Guard troops to crack down on crime. We’ll get into the legal questions surrounding the move, and Kimberly shares her thoughts as a local.

      <h1>How tariffs spoiled the Trump-Modi bromance</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/11/how-tariffs-spoiled-the-trumpmodi-bromance">https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/11/how-tariffs-spoiled-the-trumpmodi-bromance</a>)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. and India, until about a week ago when steep tariffs went into effect, had been on track to forge strong ties in trade, defense, and other areas. One thing that seems to have been lost in the tariff drama was the budding “bromance” between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also: a look at how the so-called “meme stock” effect has affected companies that have been boosted, and we talk with economist Julia Coronado about the possibility of a Fed rate cut in upcoming cycles. </p>

      <h1>Economic statistics to start cutting out some smaller cities</h1>

      <p>
      <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has been in the headlines recently for other reasons, has quietly stopped collecting economic data from smaller cities. We chat with Cornell University professor Russell Weaver on why the collection of inflation and other data is being cut in places like Buffalo, New York and Lincoln, Nebraska. Also: two American microchip makers have agreed to give the U.S. government a cut of their sales in China. </p>
