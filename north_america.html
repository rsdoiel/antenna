a new design for data centers that reduces water use. The design
“optimizes AI workloads and consumes zero water for cooling,” saving an
estimated 125 million liters of water per year per data center. It does
this by recycling water through a closed loop system, moving it between
the servers and the water chillers. All new Microsoft data center
designs will now be based on this cooling technology, and some pilots
will come online in 2026.

its plans to hold an oil and gas drilling lease sale in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge starting on January 9. The amount of land up
for auction – some 400,000 acres – is the minimum required by law. The
move seems to have angered people on all sides, for many different
reasons. Environmentalists will remember that Biden campaigned on a
promise to stop drilling in the ANWR. “The Arctic Refuge deserves to
remain a place of refuge, not an industrial oilfield lining the pockets
of big oil executives,” Kristen Miller, executive director of Alaska
Wilderness League, said in a statement. Some Indigenous groups, however,
want even more land included in the sale to maximize local economic
benefits.

overcapacity” as the main reason for the price change. Manufacturers
expanded production in anticipation of a surge in EV sales that has been
slow to materialize, and are now trying to sell off stock. Battery EV
pack prices dropped by 27% this year, dropping below $100 per
kilowatt-hour for the first time ever. This price point is “an oft-cited
rule of thumb for where EVs reach price parity with internal combustion
engine vehicles (ICEs),” the report adds. This will be hastened by
increased production of cheaper batteries outside of China.

id="south-koreas-leadership-crisis-jeopardizes-us-efforts-to-counter-china">South
Korea’s leadership crisis jeopardizes US efforts to counter China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s uncertain
political future from his martial law backlash could imperil the next
Trump administration’s trilateral coordination with the country and
Japan in countering China, analysts say.</p>
<p>Yoon faces an investigation for treason after declaring martial law
and rescinding it hours later last week. Although he survived an
impeachment vote on Saturday, the main opposition Democratic Party said
the following day it would seek an impeachment vote again.</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s leadership and the future leadership of
South Korea amid rapidly evolving political disarray and confusion.</p>
<p>Key government officials have resigned over the martial law
controversy, and the head of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), Han
Dong-hun, said Sunday that Yoon would resign soon and would no longer be
involved in conducting state affairs. In the meantime, the Defense
Ministry said Monday that Yoon still had the control of the South Korean
military.</p>
<p>The South Korean political crisis poses risks to the security of the
region, where countries such as North Korea, China and Russia lie in
wait to take advantage of the situation, analysts say.</p>
<p>“The resulting political turmoil raises uncertainty over the future
direction of the country’s policies and ability to implement them,” said
Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>“The incoming U.S. administration will be focused on countering the
multifaceted Chinese threat to the region and urging allies and partners
to assume larger roles,” he said. “Yoon’s actions will trigger doubts as
to the viability of Seoul’s roles and contributions.”</p>
<p>“Coupled with the Japanese leadership change and loss of legislative
majority by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the United States now
has two weakened allies in Northeast Asia,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba assumed office in October. The
same month, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in
parliament. </p>
<p>On Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs, met with his South Korean and Japanese
counterparts to discuss regional security, underscoring the importance
of maintaining close trilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>The trilateral ties were consolidated after Yoon extended an olive
branch to then- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after years of
frayed relations between the two countries over colonial wartime
issues.</p>
<p>The two countries’ mending of bilateral ties and their subsequent
trilateral summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August 2023, viewed as
historic in Washington, is frowned upon by South Korea’s main opposition
party, which is considered anti-Japan and pro-China.</p>
<p>If the Democratic Party files another impeachment motion and manages
to get two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly and six of nine
constitutional court judges to vote in favor, the country will hold a
special election to choose a new president.</p>
<p>If Yoon resigns or impeachment votes by the parliament and court
pass, the main opposition party has a shot at the country’s next
leadership.</p>
<p>However, how the process will unfold is uncertain as the PPP
boycotted the first impeachment vote and the constitutional court has
three vacancies.</p>
<p>Terence Roehrig, a Korea expert and professor of national security at
the U.S. Naval War College, said, “If Yoon leaves office, either through
impeachment or resignation, the special election that follows will
undoubtedly select a Democratic Party president.”</p>
<p>He continued: “As a result, there is likely to be a shift in South
Korean policy toward China and in maintaining trilateral ties with Japan
and the United States. Much has been done in the past two years to
institutionalize trilateral relations, but these efforts will be tested
with Yoon’s departure along with the incoming Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The PPP criticized Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung for what it
described as his “subservient” attitude toward China when he met with
then-Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming in March.</p>
<p>Lee said at the meeting that South Korea should not be involved in
the cross-strait issue involving Taiwan. China considers the independent
island nation as its own sovereign territory.</p>
<p>Xing in 2023 accused Yoon’s government of tilting too much toward the
U.S. and damaging South Korea’s relations with China.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press
briefing in Beijing on Monday that she will “not comment on the ROK’s
internal affairs,” referring to South Korea by its official name, the
Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation chair in Korea Studies at the
Brookings Institution, said it would not be surprising for China “to
hope for a DP to come back in office,” as during the previous Moon
Jae-in government before Yoon, because the main opposition party is
“more open to engaging China.”</p>
<p>Yeo said that based on President-elect Donald Trump’s key Cabinet
position picks, such as Representative Mike Waltz for national security
adviser and Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, both viewed as
China hawks, countering China will be a key focus, and good ties between
Seoul and Tokyo would be “desirable.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump’s preference to deal bilaterally rather than
with alliances, makes the future of the trilateral ties a bit uncertain,
Yeo said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the Trump administration may be as active as the Biden
administration was in trying to orchestrate and encourage alliances to
work together,” he said.</p>

id="polygamous-sect-leader-sentenced-to-50-years-in-child-sex-scheme">Polygamous
sect leader sentenced to 50 years in child sex scheme</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20
spiritual “wives” including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years
in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit
to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to
kidnap them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once
led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to
transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to
kidnap some of them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity,
which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count
of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life
imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served
concurrently.</p>
<p>The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the
neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah.
The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially
abandoned polygamy in 1890.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after
hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they
still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The
Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some
appeared to still be minors.</p>
<p>“You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the
opportunity to be around young women,” Brnovich told Bateman, noting
that for a man of his age the 50-year sentence was effectively a life
sentence.</p>
<p>“You took them from their homes, from their families and made them
into sex slaves,” the judge said. “You stripped them of their innocence
and childhood.”</p>
<p>A short competency hearing that was closed to the public was held
just before sentencing to discuss a doctor’s assessment of Bateman’s
mental health. The defense had argued that Bateman could have benefited
from a maximum of 20 years of psychiatric treatment behind bars before
being released.</p>
<p>The girls told the court, sometimes addressing Bateman himself, how
they grappled to develop relationships in high school, among other
struggles. Now living with foster families, they said they had received
much support from trusted adults outside their community.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, the teens hugged and wept quietly. They were
escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the
slogan “Bikers Against Child Abuse,” a group dedicated to protecting
children from what it calls dangerous people and situations. A woman who
sat with the teens said no one in the group would have a comment.</p>
<p>There was no one in the courtroom who appeared to be a supporter of
Bateman.</p>
<p>The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls whom they
claim as spiritual “wives” has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was
convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of
his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs’ trusted followers and
declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a “prophet” of the FLDS. Jeffs
denounced Bateman in a written “revelation” sent to his followers from
prison, and then tried to start his own group.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven
and that he was acting on orders from the “Heavenly Father,” Bateman
began taking female adults and children from his male followers and
proclaiming them to be his “wives,” the plea agreement said. While none
of these “marriages” were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman
acknowledged that each time he claimed another “wife,” it marked the
beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl.</p>
<p>Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess
publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged
from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some
male followers atone for their “sins” by surrendering their own wives
and daughters to him.</p>
<p>Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and
Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual
activity, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some
of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic
devices.</p>
<p>Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove
through Flagstaff, Arizona, pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted
authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of
the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a
makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years
old.</p>
<p>Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of
obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children
were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes.
Authorities also took nine children from Bateman’s home in Colorado City
into protective custody.</p>
<p>Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and
were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle
driven by one of the adult “wives.” Bateman also admitted his
involvement in the kidnapping plot.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman’s plea agreement was
contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also
called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all
assets to be immediately forfeited.</p>
<p>Seven of Bateman’s adult “wives” have been convicted of crimes
related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the
investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to
become Bateman’s spiritual “wives,” witnessed Bateman having criminal
sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving
children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman
is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the
kidnappings.</p>
<p>Two Colorado City brothers also face 10 years to life at their
sentencings, on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20, after being convicted in October of
charges including interstate travel to persuade or coerce a child to
engage in sexual activity. Authorities say one bought Bateman two
Bentley automobiles, while the other bought him a Range Rover.</p>
<p>In court records, lawyers for some of Bateman’s “wives” painted a
bleak picture of their clients’ religious upbringings.</p>
<p>One said his client was raised in a religious cult that taught sexual
activity with children was acceptable and that she was duped into
“marrying” Bateman. Another said her client was given to Bateman by
another man as if she were a piece of property, feeling she had no
choice.</p>

<h2 id="biden-under-pressure-to-commute-federal-death-sentences">Biden
under pressure to commute federal death sentences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden is facing growing calls to
commute the death sentences of the more than three dozen federal inmates
on Death Row before Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>Trump resumed federal executions during his last term in office,
overseeing 13 by lethal injection during his final six months in power,
more than any U.S. leader in 120 years.</p>
<p>Biden campaigned for the White House as an opponent of the death
penalty and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at the
federal level after he became president.</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump spoke
frequently of expanding the use of capital punishment to include
migrants who kill American citizens and drug and human traffickers.</p>
<p>There had been no federal inmates put to death in the United States
since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. </p>
<p>A coalition of death penalty opponents submitted a letter to Biden on
Monday asking him to commute federal death sentences to life in prison
without parole.</p>
<p>“The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect
Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is
commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now,” the
American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and more than 130 other organizations said.</p>
<p>“Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United
States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,”
they said.</p>
<p>There are currently 40 prisoners — all men — convicted of federal
crimes awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, including several in high-profile cases.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<pre><code>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 31, the &quot;Boston Bomber,&quot; who was sentenced to death for the murders of two people in the April 15, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.
Dylann Roof, 30, an avowed white supremacist who shot dead nine Black parishoners during a June 17, 2015 Bible study meeting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Robert Bowers, 52, an anti-Semitic Pennsylvania man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during an October 27, 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Commuted, changed’</p>
<p>Nine of the inmates on federal Death Row were convicted of murdering
fellow prisoners while one killed a prison guard.</p>
<p>Four were sentenced to death for murders committed during bank
robberies.</p>
<p>There are also four inmates on the military’s Death Row including
Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people during a
rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has not carried out an execution since 1961.</p>
<p>Pope Francis, in his Sunday address at the Vatican, asked the crowd
to pray for Death Row inmates in the United States and said their
sentences should “be commuted, changed.”</p>
<p>Biden, who controversially pardoned his son Hunter this month for tax
and gun crimes, has been barraged with clemency appeals from other
religious leaders, former state and federal prison officials,
ex-prosecutors and dozens of relatives of murder victims.</p>
<p>Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, a
former top executive at Facebook, were among the signatories of a letter
from top business leaders urging Biden to exercise his clemency
power.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, the White House is considering
“taking steps to commute at least some federal death sentences.”</p>
<p>“No decision has been made, however, about the breadth or scope of
such a possible move, including whether to do it at all,” the newspaper
said.</p>
<p>There have been 23 executions in the United States in 2024 and two
more are scheduled before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while
six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Tennessee — have moratoriums in place.</p>
<p>Federal executions are carried out by lethal injection at a prison in
Terre Haute, Indiana. The last one was on January 16, 2021, four days
before Trump left office.</p>

id="unitedhealthcare-ceo-was-likely-killed-with-a-ghost-gun-that-can-be-made-at-home">UnitedHealthcare
CEO was likely killed with a ghost gun that can be made at home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was likely
carried out with a ghost gun, one of the nearly untraceable weapons that
can be made a home, police said Monday.</p>
<p>A ghost gun is a firearm without a serial number, and police believe
the one used in last week’s shooting of Brian Thompson may have been
made with a 3D printer. It was capable of firing 9 mm rounds. The man
arrested in the crime, Luigi Mangione, also had a sound suppressor, or
silencer, police said.</p>
<p>Ghost guns have increasingly turned up at crime scenes around the
U.S. in recent years.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the weapons and efforts to regulate them:</p>
<p>What are ghost guns?</p>
<p>The firearms are privately made and have no serial numbers.</p>
<p>Generally, firearms manufactured by licensed companies must have
serial numbers — usually displayed on the frame of the gun — that allow
officials to trace the gun back to the manufacturer, the firearms dealer
and original purchaser.</p>
<p>Ghost guns, however, are made of parts that the owner can assemble
together. The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what
is known as the lower receiver. Some are sold in do-it-yourself kits,
and the receivers are typically made from metal or polymer. They include
semiautomatic handguns and rifles.</p>
<p>Are they legal?</p>
<p>It is legal in the U.S. to build a firearm for personal use. Until
about two years ago, ghost gun kits were available online that allowed
people to assemble the weapons at home without background checks or age
verification.</p>
<p>As police found more ghost guns at crime scenes, the Biden
administration moved to add age requirements and background checks in
2022.</p>
<p>Buying one now is more like purchasing a regular gun at a gun
shop.</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in
several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
Baltimore, according to court documents.</p>
<p>But gun groups have challenged the regulation in court. The Supreme
Court heard a case in October and seemed likely to uphold the
regulation. It hasn’t yet handed down a ruling.</p>
<p>Where else have ghost guns been used?</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement increased from
4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department
data. However, traditional guns are still used far more often in
crimes.</p>
<p>Ghost guns really popped into the public consciousness in 2013 when
John Zawahri opened fire on the campus of Santa Monica College in
California, killing six people, including his father and brother.
Zawahri, who was later shot and killed by police, had assembled an
AR-15-style weapon after failing a background check at a gun dealer.</p>
<p>A gunman who killed his wife and four others in Northern California
in 2017 built his own weapon to skirt a court order prohibiting him from
owning firearms. In 2019, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally
shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>A mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five
people dead in Philadelphia in 2023. A ghost gun was also used in a
shooting that critically wounded two kindergartners at a tiny religious
school in Northern California last week, police said.</p>

<h2 id="biden-memorializes-painful-past-of-native-people">Biden
memorializes painful past of Native people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday presided over his final
White House Tribal Nations Summit by reaching into the nation’s dark
past and establishing a new national monument to honor the suffering of
thousands of Native children and their families in federal boarding
schools in the last century.</p>
<p>His proclamation starts a three-year clock to design a monument to be
placed at the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in 1879, with the stated
mission to “kill the Indian” to “save the Man.” Schools like this
removed children from their families and forced them to speak English,
wear non-native clothing and eschew tribal customs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Biden described the treatment of thousands of
Native children at government boarding schools as “a blot” on the
nation’s history.</p>
<p>“The federal government mandated — mandated — removal of children
from their families and tribes, launching what’s called the federal
Indian boarding school era, over a 150-year span, 150 years from the
early 1800s to 1970 — one of the most horrific chapters in American
history,” he said earlier this year. “We should be ashamed.”</p>
<p>The most recent U.S. Census found that the population of those who
consider themselves wholly or partly Native is upward of nearly 9
million. The U.S. Department of the Interior says it serves 1.9 million
American Indian and Alaska Natives, many in sovereign lands.</p>
<p>That’s a shadow of the population that historians say thrived on the
continent before European colonization. Native Americans were only
granted universal U.S. citizenship in 1924 with the passage of the
Indian Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>Activists like Elveda Martinez of the Walker River Paiute Tribe say
it’s remarkable how recent this history of dispossession and
discrimination is.</p>
<p>“It’s within our generation that Natives finally all had the right to
vote,” she said. “So, that’s still a big thing now. We always tell
people, you know, it was our parents and people in that generation that
fought for the right to vote.”</p>
<p>As a group, Native residents have the highest poverty rate in the
country, and their youth lag behind other demographics in education,
according to a study by a bipartisan research group.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden detailed his administration’s efforts to improve the
livelihoods of descendants of the nation’s pre-colonial populations and
to give communities more say, such as designating conservation areas.
But he stressed that honoring the past is the way forward.“By making the
Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear what great
nations do,” he said. “We don’t erase history. We acknowledge it and
learn from it, so we never repeat it again.”</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as
a Cabinet secretary, praised Biden’s work.</p>
<p>“President Biden has been the best president for Indian Country in my
lifetime,” she said. “This is a president and an administration that
truly sees Indigenous people and has worked tirelessly to address the
issues in Indian Country that have long been underfunded or outright
ignored.”</p>
<p>As a sign of her esteem, Haaland, who is a member of the Pueblo of
Laguna, draped Biden in a personalized parting gift: a black-and-white
version of a blanket designed by Pueblo artist Pat Pruitt, who says the
motif, which depicts thunder and lightning in the desert, is meant to
evoke “the feeling of that calm before the storm that is filled with
electricity and sound.”</p>
<p>But as one tribe made clear Monday, America’s Native people are not a
monolith.</p>
<p>The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lashed out at the Biden
administration for what the group says is a “lack of tribal
consultation” over a wave of proposed off-reservation casinos, including
a recent approval for Oregon’s first off-reservation casino.</p>
<p>“It is performative to celebrate an administration’s contributions to
Indian Country when the actions tell a very different story,” Cow Creek
Umpqua Tribal Chairman Carla Keene said in a statement sent to VOA on
Monday. “We have been dismissed and ignored about policy that will
devastate our social, cultural, and economic livelihood. There is time
to do the right thing and put a stop to the pending decisions that will
irreversibly harm Tribes across the Pacific Northwest and West Coast,
which is a backwards step in American history, not forward.”</p>
<p>The principal chief of the large and powerful Cherokee nation — which
includes about 450,000 people — issued a careful, diplomatic statement
Monday advocating for the summit to continue under the next
administration.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to attending the White House Tribal Nation’s
summit this week,” Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. posted on Facebook. “Other
than when the summit was not held (2017-2020), I’ve been attending since
2013. I hope it is a productive engagement and I hope it continues on in
future years.”</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he views Native issues as
intertwined with energy generation, by naming North Dakota Governor Doug
Burgum as Interior secretary, while also serving as “White House energy
czar.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to do things with energy and with land interior that is
going to be incredible,” he said, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>As president, Trump angered Indigenous activists by lifting a ban on
the Keystone XL pipeline that cuts through sovereign native lands on its
path south from Canada to Texas.</p>
<p>Biden revoked Trump’s permit for the oil pipeline on the first day of
his term.</p>

wary of fissures, fragmentation as Syria looks to rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. diplomats and military officials have intensified
their outreach to groups vying to chart a new course for Syria, as well
as to Syria’s neighbors, in an effort to ensure the fall of the regime
of former President Bashar Assad does not give way to a more unstable
and dangerous future.</p>
<p>A number of key meetings took place Monday in Jordan, where senior
U.S. diplomatic officials held consultations with their Jordanian
counterparts following similar meetings a day earlier in Doha,
Qatar.</p>
<p>And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more diplomatic
missions are in the works.</p>
<p>“Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the
region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States
can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the
future” Blinken told an audience at the State Department Monday.</p>
<p>“This moment presents a historic opportunity, but it also carries
considerable risks,” he said. “History shows how quickly moments of
promise can descend into conflict and violence.”</p>
<p>As evidence of the U.S. concern, the commander of U.S. Central
Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, also engaged
with allies in the region.</p>
<p>General Michael “Erik” Kurilla met in Amman with Major General Yousef
Al-Hunaiti, the chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff.
According to a U.S. readout, Kurilla promised U.S. support for Jordan
should the situation in Syria deteriorate.</p>
<p>Other U.S. officials on Monday likewise emphasized the need for a
calm and orderly transition in Syria.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that our allies are safe and secure,” U.S.
Deputy United Nations Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters at the U.N.
in New York.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that there isn’t a humanitarian catastrophe,”
Wood said. “So, we’re going to be working over the coming days and weeks
to try to make sure that we can ensure all of those things happen.”</p>
<p>But officials at the State Department and the Pentagon caution there
is ample reason to worry that hopes for a better future for the Syrian
people could disintegrate, with differences leading to new waves of
violence and even migrations out of Syria.</p>
<p>They say that while the words and actions of Syrian rebel leaders,
including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s Abu Mohammed al-Golani, seem promising,
pledges for a new, inclusive government will be tested if tensions
between rival groups continue to simmer or escalate.</p>
<p>And the State Department officials said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a
U.S.-designated terror group that grew out of the al-Qaida terror
group’s Syrian affiliate before cutting ties, has yet to show that it
deserves to have the terror designation removed.</p>
<p>So too, there are concerns about the Islamic State terror group,
which commands between 2,500 and 5,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq,
and which has been growing stronger in recent months.</p>
<p>“ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to
create safe havens,” Blinken said Monday, using an acronym for the
terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. “We are determined not to let
that happen.”</p>
<p>U.S. allies on the ground in Syria, however, warn IS has already
begun ramping up its attacks, seeking to take advantage of the collapse
of Syrian regime forces over the past week.</p>
<p>“We are worried,” the U.S. representative for the political wing of
the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told VOA,
pointing to an uptick in attacks across northeastern Syria.</p>
<p>“They are targeting our internal security forces,” said Syrian
Democratic Council representative Sinam Mohamad, noting efforts by IS
sleeper cells in places like Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and even Hasakah, home
to one of the SDF-run prisons holding thousands of IS fighters captured
after the fall of the terror group’s self-declared caliphate in
2019.</p>
<p>She also warned of increased activity, and new escape attempts at
al-Hol, a displaced persons camp that holds tens of thousands of IS
wives and other family members, many of them children.</p>
<p>Mohamad praised U.S. forces for lending support to the SDF but said
there are indications of additional IS activity in areas abandoned by
Syrian regime forces along with their Russian and Iranian allies.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials hope a series of airstrikes, carried out
Sunday at five locations across central Syria, will help to blunt the
threat.</p>
<p>The strikes are “a way to certainly prevent them [IS] from taking
advantage of the dynamics within Syria and the current situation,” said
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters at the Pentagon
Monday.</p>
<p>But U.S. counterterrorism officials have long warned that IS is
capable of demonstrating both patience and resilience and is well-aware
of the types of fissures that could still serve to derail a transition
government in Syria.</p>
<p>And perhaps nowhere are those tensions more palpable at the moment
than in Syria’s northeast, where fighting has broken out between Kurdish
militias and the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of
Turkish-backed militias.</p>
<p>Turkey has defended various efforts to strike at the SDF, claiming it
is led by fighters with the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, a
Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party
(PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>The SDC and SDF, in return, have accused the SNA of attacking
civilians in Manbij, and other nearby areas.</p>
<p>“The United States, now, they are trying to stop this,” the SDC’s
Mohamad told VOA.</p>
<p>“There is some negotiation,” she said. “We hope they [the U.S.] can
succeed in that.”</p>
<p>The State Department Monday said it has been clear with both sides,
echoing warnings from the SDF that ongoing clashes could hurt the
ability of the U.S.-backed force to contain IS.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to see an escalation,” said spokesperson Matthew
Miller of the clashes between Kurdish groups and the SNA. “We don’t want
to see anyone take advantage of this period of instability to try, and
further their own position.”</p>

Media mogul Murdoch fails in bid to change family trust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch has lost a bid to change his family trust to
consolidate control of his media empire in the hands of his son Lachlan,
The New York Times reported Monday, citing a sealed court document. </p>
<p>Nevada Commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded in a decision filed
Saturday that Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, who is the head of
Fox News parent Fox Corp and News Corp, had acted in “bad faith” in
their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, the Times reported. </p>
<p>The court docket indicates Gorman issued a recommendation or order
Saturday, but the document is not publicly available. </p>
<p>The trust currently would divide control of the company equally among
Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence
— after his death. </p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch proposed amending the family trust to solidify
Lachlan’s leadership of the family’s media empire after his death, and
block any interference by three of Lachlan’s siblings, who are
politically moderate, the Times reported. </p>
<p>Under one scenario, three of the heirs could technically outvote a
fourth, setting up a battle over the future of the powerful media
outlets, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox and is sole chair of News
Corp. </p>
<p>In his opinion, Gorman said, the plan to change the trust was a
“carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s
executive roles” inside the empire “regardless of the impacts such
control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries” of the
family trust, the Times said. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said they were
disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal, the Times reported.
The commissioner’s ruling is subject to approval by a district judge,
whose decision could be challenged in court. </p>
<p>The trust was set up in Nevada, which is prized for its strict
confidentiality rules. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch, 93, could not immediately be
reached for comment. Lachlan Murdoch did not respond to an email seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Lachlan’s siblings issued a joint statement expressing hope that the
family would focus on mending relationships. </p>
<p>“We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move
beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding
relationships among all family members,” the siblings said.</p>

Years of Delay Means to an Offshore Wind Project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzOTk2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODQwNzg0OH0._GyqbDXWOLHCu2YdMuM_d1YvkLVolQBQYXFgeyZpMcI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As soon as Donald Trump was declared the winner of November’s
presidential election, climate advocates vowed to continue making
progress at the state and local level. But some local projects may still
depend too much on federal policy to move forward.
</p>
<p>
The president-elect’s influence has already put a highly anticipated
plan to convert New York City’s biggest power plant into a renewable
energy hub on shaky ground. Central to the conversion is a
1,400-megawatt offshore wind farm called Attentive Energy developed by
TotalEnergies. Trump, a longtime critic of the industry, has
<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-wildwood-new-jersey-may-11-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
vague threats</u></a> to “end” offshore wind “on day one.” While that
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/how-will-offshore-wind-fare-under-a-second-trump-term" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overstates
his capabilities</a>, his administration will, at the very least, have
the power to slow the processing of permits.
</p>
<p>
The regulatory uncertainty was enough to convince Patrick Pouyanne, the
CEO of TotalEnergies, to put Attentive Energy on pause, he said at the
Energy Intelligence Forum in London, according to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/total-pauses-new-york-offshore-wind-farm-plans-after-trump-win" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>
— though he left open the possibility of reviving it “in four years.”
</p>
<p>
That’s bad news for the Ravenswood Generating Station in Long Island
City, Queens. Ravenswood consists of three steam turbines built in the
1960s that run mostly on natural gas, though sometimes also on oil, plus
a natural gas combined cycle unit built in 2004. Together, they emitted
nearly 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 in 2023, or about 8% of the city’s
carbon emissions from electricity production, while representing more
than 20% of the city’s local generating capacity. Ravenswood is also
situated across the street from the largest public housing project in
the country, and has spewed pollution into the area colloquially
referred to as “asthma alley” for decades.
</p>
<p>
Rise Light and Power, the company that owns the plant, has said it will
redress those harms to the community by transforming the site into
“Renewable Ravenswood.” The aspiration includes retiring the three
1960s-era generators and replacing them with offshore wind, battery
energy storage, and additional renewable energy delivered from upstate
New York via a new transmission line. Long term, the company says it
will repurpose the plant’s cooling infrastructure to provide clean
heating and cooling to buildings in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Members of the community and local political leaders celebrated the
proposal and showed up at rallies and public hearings to support it.
Rise Light and Power also incorporated clean energy job training into
the plan and earned the support of the union workers who operate the
plant. The environmental group Earthjustice recently cited Renewable
Ravenswood
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024.09.23_earthjusticecomments.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a state filing</u></a> as a shining example of “a more
community-centered approach to energy planning.”
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
for Renewable Ravenswood declares that the plan “starts with offshore
wind,” and
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/initiatives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says</u></a>
that “Attentive Energy One is the first step.” When Attentive Energy
submitted its initial bid for a power contract with the state last year,
Rise Light and Power CEO Clint Plummer
<a href="https://citylimits.org/2023/08/15/citys-largest-power-plant-nears-milestone-in-renewable-energy-push" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the local outlet </u><u><em><em>City Limits</em></em></u></a><em>
</em>that the wind farm “essentially unlocks ‘Renewable Ravenswood.’”
</p>
<p>
Now, it’s unclear when the promised air quality benefits and jobs will
materialize.
</p>
<p>
When I hopped on the phone with Plummer, the Ravenswood CEO, last week,
he downplayed the implications of the pause.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it changes that much,” he told me, stressing that
“project delays don’t impact our commitment to the vision” and that
“it’s simply part of the process of developing these large scale energy
infrastructure projects.” Plummer said the company could continue to
make progress on permitting, engineering, and other related work on the
site and in the community in the meantime. Since New York state has
significantly more control over onshore renewables and transmission, he
said, it may be possible to move more quickly on those.
</p>
<p>
The pause on Attentive Energy may have come with or without Trump — the
project, which is a joint venture between Rise Light and Power,
TotalEnergies, and Corio, had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/new-york-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>withdrawn
its revised bid</u></a> for a contract to sell power into New York’s
energy market in October. When I asked Attentive for clarification,
however, representatives didn’t respond.
</p>
<p>
The wind farm pause is the third big setback to the company’s
replacement plans in as many years.
</p>
<p>
The first effort to bring clean energy to Ravenswood was a 316-megawatt
battery project the New York Public Service Commission approved in 2019.
It was slated to be completed by April 2021, but by January of that
year, the company had
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/lacking-contract-ls-power-delays-major-battery-storage-station-in-ny-62467197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
yet secured an offtake agreement with Con Edison</u></a>, the local
utility, and so asked for a three-year extension. The development still
has not broken ground. “Our project, and most like it that have been
proposed in New York City, are awaiting the State’s expected battery
procurement next year,” a spokesperson told me when I asked for a status
update. “We expect that projects that received State incentives through
that program will likely be able to proceed to construction quickly.”
</p>
<p>
The company also
<a href="https://riselight.com/rise-plans-innovative-solution-to-power-15-of-nyc-with-upstate-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to the New York State Energy Research and Development
Agency in May of 2021 to build a transmission line called the Catskills
Renewable Connector that would be capable of delivering 1,200 megawatts
of renewable energy from upstate solar and wind farms to the Ravenswood
site, meeting up to 15% of the city’s electricity needs. But the agency
passed over the proposal in favor of two other transmission lines —
Clean Path New York, which would bring renewable power to the city from
Western New York, and the Champlain Hudson Power Express, which would
deliver hydropower from Canada. (While construction on the latter
project is
<a href="https://chpexpress.com/construction-progress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>well
underway</u></a>, Clean Path was cancelled the day before Thanksgiving.)
</p>
<p>
“We weren’t selected then, but we’ve continued to mature and advance
that project,” Plummer told me, regarding the Catskills line. “All these
projects take a very long period of time to realize.”
</p>
<p>
The only aspect of Renewable Ravenswood that’s still alive and kicking,
at least publicly, is the
<a href="https://queensbororenewableexpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Queensborough
Renewable Express</u></a>, a set of high-voltage power lines that would
connect the site to any future offshore wind farms in New York Harbor.
The company is currently awaiting approval on a key permit for the line
from the New York Public Service Commission. But while much of the
project is located within the jurisdiction of New York, part of it will
also need federal approvals.
</p>
<p>
Plummer may not be too concerned about the wind farm’s delay, but a
freeze on offshore wind development for the next four years would
further stretch New York’s already strained climate goals.
</p>
<p>
New York law requires the state to get 70% of its energy from renewable
sources by 2030 and 100% from zero-emissions sources by 2040. The
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/renewables/NYPA-Renewables-Draft-Strategic-Plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
recent progress report</u></a> on those goals, compiled by the New York
Power Authority, found that the state had enough renewable energy
operating and contracted so far to supply about 44% of expected demand
in 2030.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://dps.ny.gov/news/comments-sought-regarding-clean-energy-standard-biennial-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>separate
state analysis</u></a> showed that offshore wind would play a key role
in reaching the target, with an expected 6 gigawatts of offshore wind
generation getting New York about 15% of the way there. But so far, the
state has finalized contracts for only about 1.7 gigawatts. Though New
York has several additional contracts pending awards, none of those
potential projects has yet submitted construction plans to the federal
Bureau of Ocean Management. If that office freezes its offshore wind
work for the next four years, it’s possible none of them will be able to
start construction until the 2030s at the earliest.
</p>
<p>
“Four years may not be significant for project development time frames,”
Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy advisor for the city of
New York, told me. “But the state has these 2030 and 2040 goals, and so
many pieces of what makes up the ability to hit those goals are under
stress. So it’s certainly not good news.”
</p>
<p>
New Yorkers aren’t the only ones who will be affected by the pause.
Attentive Energy was also working on two additional offshore wind
projects that would send power to New Jersey. The developer had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energy-two-celebrates-award-of-offshore-wind-contract-to-deliver-1-3-gw-of-clean-energy-and-thousands-of-jobs-into-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secured
a contract</u></a> to sell power into that state from a 1.3-gigawatt
project called Attentive Energy Two. In July, it
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energys-proposal-to-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to New Jersey’s fourth offshore wind solicitation for an
additional, unnamed 1.3-gigawatt project. The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities is expected to reach a decision on that solicitation this
month.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to TotalEnergies to ask whether all three projects were
paused or just the New York one, but the company said it would not
comment on Pouyanne’s speech. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
also did not respond as to whether Attentive had pulled either its
awarded contract or bid.
</p>
<p>
It’s true that developing these projects takes a long time, and that
anyone excited about Renewable Ravenswood should not have expected any
new clean power to come into the site until the end of this decade,
anyway. But further delays could have real consequences. “Any of these
projects faltering is just going to keep New York City reliant on an
aging and dirty fossil fleet,” said Zarrilli. The city is in a hole, he
said, after the Indian Point nuclear plant closed and made it even more
reliant on natural gas for electricity.
</p>
<p>
On my call with Plummer, he emphasized several times that the city has
“the thinnest reserve margins we’ve had in decades” — in other words, it
doesn’t have much wiggle room to meet increases in electricity demand.
Rise Light and Power has already shut down 17 small gas “peaker” plants
that were previously part of Ravenswood to make room for new renewable
energy infrastructure. The city will be in better shape in 2026,
assuming the Champlain Hudson Power Express finishes on time,
<a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2248793/2024-RNA-Report.pdf/0fe6fd1e-0f28-0332-3e80-28bea71a2344?t=1732195607468" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the New York grid operator NYISO</u></a>. But by the early 2030s,
when additional peaker plants are expected to be shut down due to
pollution regulations, New York could be back on thin ice.
</p>
<p>
By then, the steam turbines at Ravenswood will be nearly 70 years old.
Unless significant additional generation comes online by then, Rise
Light and Power could be forced to re-invest in those gas generators
rather than retire them. “It’d be terrible if they were forced to make
that choice in the future,” said Zarrilli.

in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing charged with murder in New York, court
records show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Altoona, Pennsylvania — After UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was gunned down
on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs,
drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city’s muscular surveillance
system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet
addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.</p>
<p>When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative
efforts shared credit with an alert civilian’s instincts. A Pennsylvania
McDonald’s customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the
oblique security camera photos that New York police had publicized.</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a
prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the
killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States’ largest
medical insurance companies.</p>
<p>He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged
with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false
identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had
added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He’s
expected to be extradited to New York eventually.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the
allegations. Asked at Monday’s arraignment whether he needed a public
defender, Mangione asked whether he could “answer that at a future
date.”</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald’s
customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.
Police in Altoona, about 375 kilometers west of New York City, were soon
summoned.</p>
<p>They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the
restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop,
according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione
whether he’d been to New York recently, he “became quiet and started to
shake,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>When he pulled his mask down at officers’ request, “we knew that was
our guy,” rookie Officer Tyler Frye said at a news conference in
Hollidaysburg.</p>
<p>New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news
conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill
Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New
York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a
three-page, handwritten document that shows “some ill will toward
corporate America.”</p>
<p>A law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed
to have acted alone.</p>
<p>“To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do
for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly
that I wasn’t working with anyone,” the document said, according to the
official.</p>
<p>It also had a line that said, “I do apologize for any strife or
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it
coming.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was
found with a passport and $10,000 in cash — $2,000 of it in foreign
currency. Mangione disputed the amount.</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a
midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came
to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to
wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.</p>
<p>Investigators have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on
ammunition found near Thompson’s body. The words mimic a phrase used to
criticize the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the
shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a
northern Manhattan bus terminal.</p>
<p>Once in Pennsylvania, he went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,
“trying to stay low-profile” by avoiding cameras, Pennsylvania State
Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.</p>
<p>A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and
philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state
legislator. Mangione was valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep
school, where his 2016 graduation speech lauded his classmates’
“incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.”</p>
<p>He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer
science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s
family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his
cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione. “We offer our prayers to the
family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all
involved.”</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione worked for a time for the car-buying website
TrueCar and left in 2023, CEO Jantoon Reigersman said by email.</p>
<p>From January to June 2022, Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a “co-living”
space at the edge of Honolulu tourist mecca Waikiki.</p>
<p>Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote
workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a
spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.</p>
<p>“Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no
complaints,” Ryan said. “There was no sign that might point to these
alleged crimes they’re saying he committed.”</p>
<p>At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from
childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to
romance, Ryan said.</p>
<p>“He went surfing with R.J. once but it didn’t work out because of his
back,” Ryan said, but noted that Mangione and Martin often went together
to a rock-climbing gym.</p>
<p>Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said,
then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.</p>
<p>Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.</p>
<p>Although the gunman obscured his face during the shooting, he left a
trail of evidence in New York, including a backpack he ditched in
Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, a water bottle
and a protein bar wrapper.</p>
<p>In the days after the shooting, the NYPD collected hundreds of hours
of surveillance video and released multiple clips and still images in
hopes of enlisting the public’s eyes to help find a suspect.</p>
<p>“This combination of old-school detective work and new-age technology
is what led to this result today,” Tisch said at the New York news
conference.</p>

id="veteran-daniel-penny-is-acquitted-in-nyc-subway-chokehold-case-over-jordan-neelys-death">Veteran
Daniel Penny is acquitted in NYC subway chokehold case over Jordan
Neely’s death</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A Marine veteran who used a chokehold on an agitated
subway rider was acquitted on Monday in a death that became a prism for
differing views about public safety, valor and vigilantism. </p>
<p>A Manhattan jury cleared Daniel Penny of criminally negligent
homicide in Jordan Neely’s 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter
charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that
count. </p>
<p>Penny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly
smiled as the verdict was read. Both applause and anger erupted in the
courtroom, and Neely’s father and two supporters were ushered out after
audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears. </p>
<p>“It really, really hurts,” Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, said
outside the courthouse. “I had enough of this. The system is
rigged.” </p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the Democrat whose office
brought the case, said prosecutors “followed the facts and the evidence
from beginning to end” and respect the verdict. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from lawyers for Penny, who rushed to
a waiting car after the verdict. The anonymous jury, which had started
deliberating Tuesday, was escorted out of court to a van. </p>
<p>Penny’s attorneys had said he was protecting himself and other subway
passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming
remarks and gestures. </p>
<p>The case amplified many American fault lines, among them race,
politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was
Black. Penny is white. </p>
<p>There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse,
including Monday, when chants could be heard through the courtroom
window ahead of the verdict. High-profile Republican politicians
portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely’s
funeral. </p>
<p>Penny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study
architecture. </p>
<p>Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story:
His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a
teenager. </p>
<p>As a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes — complete with
moonwalks — on the city’s streets and subways. But Neely also struggled
with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was
convicted of murdering her. </p>
<p>He subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was
repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and
realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to
medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he
died. </p>
<p>Neely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty
and having to “dig through the garbage” for food made him feel so
hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records
show. </p>
<p>About six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1,
2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry
and thirsty and didn’t care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said.
Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he’d
harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid. </p>
<p>Neely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and
didn’t touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that
alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him. </p>
<p>Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor
and “put him out,” as the veteran told police at the scene. </p>
<p>Passengers’ video showed that at one point during the roughly
six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker’s leg and gestured to him.
Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute
before Penny released him. </p>
<p>“He’s dying,” an unseen bystander said in one video. “Let him
go!” </p>
<p>A witness who stepped in to hold down Neely’s arms testified that he
told Penny to free the man, though Penny’s lawyers noted the witness’
story changed significantly over time. </p>
<p>Penny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely
threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to
“de-escalate” the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said
he held on as long as he did because Neely periodically squirmed. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t trying to injure him. I’m just trying to keep him from
hurting anyone else. He’s threatening people. That’s what we learn in
the Marine Corps,” Penny told the detectives. </p>
<p>However, one of Penny’s Marine Corps instructors testified that the
veteran misused a chokehold technique he’d been taught. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he
perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any
need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at
the next station, seconds after Penny took action. </p>
<p>Although Penny himself told police he’d used “a choke” or “a
chokehold,” one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a
Marine-taught chokehold “modified as a simple civilian restraint.” The
defense lawyers contended that Penny didn’t consistently apply enough
pressure to kill Neely. </p>
<p>Contradicting a city medical examiner’s finding, a pathologist hired
by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the
combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a
blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during
exertion. </p>
<p>Penny did not testify, but several of his relatives, friends and
fellow Marines did — describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and
empathetic man. </p>
<p>The manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny
recklessly caused Neely’s death. Criminally negligent homicide involves
engaging in serious “blameworthy conduct” while not perceiving such a
risk. Both charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison
time. </p>
<p>While the criminal trial played out, Neely’s father filed a wrongful
death suit against Penny.</p>

asks federal appeals court to bar enforcement of potential ban until
Supreme Court review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden
administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the
popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the
statue. </p>
<p>The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same
court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which
requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a
ban as soon as next month, was constitutional. </p>
<p>If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance,
which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app
will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million
American users. </p>
<p>“Before that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity,
as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to
decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,” attorneys
for the two companies wrote in the legal filing on Monday. </p>
<p>It’s not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time
he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action. </p>
<p>In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political
realities, saying that an injunction would provide a “modest delay” that
would give “the incoming Administration time to determine its position —
which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court
review.”</p>

Perez,’ ‘The Brutalist’ lead Golden Globe film nominations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — Musical thriller “Emilia Perez” and
historical epic “The Brutalist” led the roster of films nominated on
Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off
the movie awards season leading to the Oscars.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez,” released by Netflix NFLX.O, scored 10 nods and “The
Brutalist,” from independent distributor A24, earned seven.</p>
<p>Taking home a Globe can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards
in March. Last year’s Hollywood strikes scrambled this year’s release
schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best
picture at the Oscars.</p>
<p>The Globe winners will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists
from 85 countries and will be announced Jan. 5 at a ceremony broadcast
live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez” stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a drug cartel
leader (Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón) fake his death and transition
from a man to a woman. Selena Gomez co-stars as the cartel leader’s
wife. All three were nominated for by Globes voters for acting
honors.</p>
<p>“The Brutalist” stars Adrien Brody in an epic tale of a Hungarian
immigrant who flees the horrors of World War Two to rebuild his life in
the United States.</p>
<p>Box office smash “Wicked,” adapted from a long-running Broadway play
about the witches in “The Wizard of Oz,” landed four nominations.</p>

report on global aridity</a> from the UN Convention to Combat
Desertification. The study found that more than 75% of all land on Earth
has become drier over the last three decades, and that during that time,
drylands expanded by an area the size of the Australian continent to
cover 40% of all the global land (excluding Antarctica). This is a very
bad trend. Aridity is different from drought. While drought eventually
recedes, aridity is “an unrelenting menace,” leading to land
degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity decline, crop losses, and
large-scale human migration. Human-caused climate change is the main
cause of the aridity crisis. “If the world fails in efforts to curb
greenhouse gas emissions,” the UN warned, “another 3% of the world’s
humid areas are projected to transform into drylands by the end of this
century.”

getting a new regime, but not a new economy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The Assad family ruled Syria for more than half a century, and that
dynasty has come to an end. The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or
HTS, is consolidating control and will inherit an economy devastated by
a decade of brutal civil war that cost 500,000 lives. What could
economic recovery look like? Then, China preps for a U.S. trade war
under Trump, and global criminals utilize cryptocurrency to launder
money.

id="polarization-is-merriam-websters-2024-word-of-the-year">‘Polarization’
is Merriam-Webster’s 2024 word of the year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the
country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for
celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the
Merriam-Webster word of the year is “polarization”?</p>
<p>“Polarization means division, but it’s a very specific kind of
division,” said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor at large, in
an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s
announcement. “Polarization means that we are tending toward the
extremes rather than toward the center.”</p>
<p>The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls
with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to
the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000
voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat
concerned that Donald Trump’s views — but not Harris’ — were too
extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris
— but not Trump.</p>
<p>The Merriam-Webster entry for “polarization” reflects scientific and
metaphorical definitions. It’s most commonly used to mean “causing
strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.”</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its
site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in
search and usage.</p>
<p>Last year’s pick was “authentic.” This year’s comes as large swaths
of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.</p>
<p>“It’s always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind
of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,” Sokolowski
said. “It’s a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news,
alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word’s
meaning in the culture.”</p>
<p>It’s notable that “polarization” originated in the early 1800s — and
not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about
science, Sokolowski said. He called it a “pretty young word,” in the
scheme of the English language. “Polarized is a term that brings
intensity to another word,” he continued, most frequently used in the
U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.</p>
<p>“The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,”
the Merriam-Webster editor continued. “We’ve had dictionaries of English
for 420 years and it’s only been in the last 20 years or so that we’ve
actually known which words people look up.”</p>
<p>“Polarization” extends beyond political connotations. It’s used to
highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends
and other industries.</p>
<p>All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift’s private jet usage? Polarizing.
Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The
International Olympic Committee’s decision to strip American gymnast
Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it:
polarizing.</p>
<p>Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian
breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn’s performance — or the proliferation
of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved
polarizing.</p>
<p>Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word
itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the
political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and
CNN.</p>
<p>“It’s used by both sides,” he said, “and in a little bit ironic twist
to the word, it’s something that actually everyone agrees on.”</p>
<p>Rounding out Merriam-Webster’s top 10 words of 2024:</p>
<p>Demure</p>
<p>TikToker Jools Lebron’s 38-second video describing her workday makeup
routine as “very demure, very mindful” lit up the summer with memes. The
video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding “huge spikes”
in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means
reserved or modest.</p>
<p>Fortnight</p>
<p>Taylor Swift’s song “Fortnight,” featuring rapper Post Malone,
undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks.
“Music can still send people to the dictionary,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Totality</p>
<p>The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are
tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico’s
Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of
totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully
blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate
amount — or wholeness.</p>
<p>Resonate</p>
<p>“Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of
the word ‘resonate,’” Sokolowski said. This may be because the word,
which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional
way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial
intelligence “also betrays itself to be a robot because it’s using that
word too much.”</p>
<p>Allision</p>
<p>The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March,
a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. “When you
have one moving object into a fixed object, that’s an allision, not a
collision. You’re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in
fact, in motion,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Weird</p>
<p>This summer on the TV news show “Morning Joe,” Minnesota Gov. Tim
Walz called Republican leaders “weird.” It may have been what launched
his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential
nominee. Though it’s a word that people typically misspell — is it “ei”
or “ie”? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable,
Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Cognitive</p>
<p>Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe
Biden’s debate performance or Trump’s own age, it cropped up often. It
refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning,
or remembering.</p>
<p>Pander</p>
<p>Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said.
“Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to
different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights
supporters.” Whereas Walz said Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s kitchen
pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what
someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not
“good, proper, reasonable, etc.”</p>
<p>Democracy</p>
<p>In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make “democracy” its first word
of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of
government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions,
policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary’s most looked
up. “There’s a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,”
Sokolowski said. “Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the
public shows, is that they’re paying attention.”</p>

<p>Both U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump
reacted Sunday to the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria.
Given its strategic interests in the Middle East, the U.S. is expected
to keep a close eye on what lies ahead in Syria. VOA’s Veronica Balderas

Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests
are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday
evening in Washington. </p>
<p>This year’s recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic
accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the
Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter
Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo,
which has launched generations of Black artists, is being
recognized. </p>
<p>There will be personalized tributes with performances and
testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the
traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. </p>
<p>The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients
themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her
longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on
stage to perform Cher’s hit, “If I Could Turn Back Time.” </p>
<p>Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past
tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. </p>
<p>Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese’s induction in
2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet
legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy
and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the
1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in
a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. </p>
<p>The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial
to the band’s founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age
84. </p>
<p>This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without
political intrigue for a while. </p>
<p>During Republican Donald Trump’s first four years in office, Kennedy
Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the
tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy
toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear
threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who
takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his
first term. </p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for
the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center
ceremony afterward. </p>
<p>The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.</p>

id="biden-assads-syrian-collapse-a-fundamental-act-of-justice">Biden:
Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of
the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a “fundamental act of
justice,” but that it was “a moment of uncertainty” for the Mideast.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the
decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was “the best opportunity in
a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.”</p>
<p>Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two
years weakened Syria’s backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported
Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that “for the first time”
they could no longer defend the Assad government.</p>
<p>“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,”
Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the
White House.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his
country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, “was not interested in protecting
him any longer.”</p>
<p>Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he
decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in
Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, “THIS IS
NOT OUR FIGHT.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according
to Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with
Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S.
forces on Sunday conducted “dozens” of what he called “precision
airstrikes” on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria.</p>
<p>Biden said the U.S. is “clear eyed” that ISIS will try to take
advantage of the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a
terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat
Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida.</p>
<p>“We will remain vigilant,” Biden said. “Make no mistake, some of the
rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of
terrorism and human rights abuses.” He added that the groups are “saying
the right things now.”</p>
<p>“But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just
their words, but their actions,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and
Russia’s war in Ukraine, noting that Assad’s allies in Moscow, as well
as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, “are in a weakened
state right now.”</p>
<p>Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq,
wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the
insurgents.</p>
<p>“Many of ‘the rebels’ are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope
they’ve moderated. Time will tell,” he said.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S.
journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him.</p>
<p>“To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that
we’re waiting for Austin,” Tice’s mother, Debra, said in comments that
hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. “We know that when he
comes out, he’s going to be fairly dazed &amp; he’s going to need lots
of care &amp; direction. Direct him to his family please!”</p>
<p>Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus.</p>
<p>“We’ve remained committed to returning him to his family,” Biden told
reporters. “We believe he’s alive, we think we can get him back, but we
have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held
accountable.”</p>
<p>The president added: “We have to identify where he [Tice] is.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="trump-picks-lawyer-to-serve-as-counselor-to-the-president">Trump
picks lawyer to serve as counselor to the president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that
he had chosen Alina Habba, his personal attorney, to serve as counselor
to the president.</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Habba a “tireless
advocate for justice.”</p>
<p>“She has been unwavering in her loyalty and unmatched in her resolve
— standing with me through numerous ‘trials,’ battles and countless days
in Court,” Trump said. “Few understand the Weaponization of the
‘Injustice’ System better than Alina.”</p>
<p>Trump announced several other planned additions to his
administration, including Christopher Landau as his choice to serve as
deputy secretary of state. Landau was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Trump also said former National Security Council spokesman Michael
Anton will serve as the director of policy planning at the State
Department, while Michael Needham will serve as counselor of the State
Department.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Trump vowed to make swift and sweeping changes as he
takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the
country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise
consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend
his 2020 reelection loss. </p>
<p>Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the
White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making
him only the second American president elected to a second,
nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>“People like me now, you know?” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an
interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday.</p>
<p>“It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time
[in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,” he said. “And one thing
that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the
popular vote, and by a lot,” with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his
defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots
that were cast.</p>
<p>But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances,
refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election
to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent
balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in
his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a
month ago, Trump said, “Because I think it was too big to rig.”</p>
<p>Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped
insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of
Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the
January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying
to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020
election.</p>
<p>He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the
investigative panel “political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what
they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”</p>
<p>Trump said that on his first day in office he would be “acting very
quickly” to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an
array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them
have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to
go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as
“hostages” and called them “patriots.”</p>
<p>“These people are living in hell,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate Biden. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said.
“Retribution will be through success.”</p>
<p>But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida
state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal
political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy
in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special
counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as “very corrupt.”</p>
<p>Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S.
border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First
will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump
officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the
first to be deported.</p>
<p>“I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing
to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules,
regulations, laws. They came in illegally,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status,
where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. “I
don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break
up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all
back,” he declared.</p>
<p>Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive
deportation plan does not faze him.</p>
<p>“You have no choice,” he said. “First of all, they’re costing us a
fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it.
And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it
goes.”</p>
<p>But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to
exempt so-called “dreamers” from deportation, young children who were
brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little
connection to their native countries.</p>
<p>He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the
U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees
citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of
their parents being in the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on
imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico
and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not “guarantee American
families won’t pay more” as a result of his plan.</p>
<p>“I can’t guarantee anything,” Trump said. “I can’t guarantee
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, “if I
can.” He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his
administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in
September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.</p>

id="moana-2-cruises-to-another-record-weekend-600-million-globally">‘Moana
2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s animated film “Moana 2” remained at the top of
the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in
another record haul. </p>
<p>The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original,
and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.</p>
<p>The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following
Thanksgiving weekend, unseating “Frozen II,” which earned $35.2 million
in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for
inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, “Moana 2” has
already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year.
Its performance means Disney has three films in this year’s top five,
including “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.” The studio also
has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins’
“Mufasa,” out Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s
horror comedy “Y2K” and the Jude Law crime thriller “The Order.” But
nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the
enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, “Moana 2,” “Wicked” and “Gladiator
II.”</p>
<p>Second place at the box office was occupied by “Wicked,” which added
$34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three
weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at
$455.6 million. “Gladiator II” followed in third place with $12.5
million, while “Red One” came in fourth with $7 million.</p>
<p>“These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put
an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,” said Paul
Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie
business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number
was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and
up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for
the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the
deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. </p>
<p>The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th
anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which
played in only 165 theaters, did better than “Y2K” ($2.1 million) and
“The Order” ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science
fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in
an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX
presentations of “Interstellar” were sold out through the weekend.</p>
<p>“I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original
IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend,” Nolan said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic “Pushpa:
The Rule – Part 2,” which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll’s
anime release, “Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,” made $2.4 million. Fathom
also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s “A Drummer Boy Christmas”
concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.</p>
<p>“It’s a really diverse marketplace,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s
event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film.
It’s easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever
seen.”</p>
<p>Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies,
with both Sony’s comic book film “Kraven the Hunter” and the animated
“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” opening in wide
release. Awards contenders “Nickel Boys” and “September 5” will also
open in a limited number of theaters.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in
Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an
immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with
French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv “would like to make a deal”
to end the more than 1,000-day war. </p>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and
Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that
“should never have started.” </p>
<p>“There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should
begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families
destroyed,” he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to
act to bring the fighting to an end. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel
Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as “constructive”. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any
peace deal “should be just” for Ukrainians, “so that Russia and Putin or
any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.” </p>
<p>In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that
Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow’s all-out invasion on
Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. </p>
<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official
casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few
months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant
record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded
each month.</p>

oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe
age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials
said. </p>
<p>The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to
Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the
Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg,
the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said in a
Facebook post this week. </p>
<p>Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the
Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate
for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for
several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she
returned last week, officials said. </p>
<p>“We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,” Jonathan Plissner,
supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge,
said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the
refuge to nest and raise their young. </p>
<p>Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months.
Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They
spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and
fish eggs. </p>
<p>Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as
30 chicks, Plissner said. </p>
<p>The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

id="as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows">As
data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the
rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia.
He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes
and neighbors wave hello.</p>
<p>But now, as he’s approaching 60, he’s considering selling his Fairfax
County home and moving away. That’s because he’s getting a new neighbor:
Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical
substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds
and a community center.</p>
<p>Newman feels helpless to stop it.</p>
<p>“I planned on staying here until I died,” he said, “until this came
up.”</p>
<p>The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed
servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and
computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape,
popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.</p>
<p>Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid
growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local
governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.
But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas,
abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents
are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over
concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their
communities.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight
against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough
to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to
homes.</p>
<p>“All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in
this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn’t
run residents away from their homes,” he said.</p>
<p>Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia</p>
<p>In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling
hills of the area’s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular
Washington &amp; Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data
centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation’s
capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.</p>
<p>Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on
neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners
association in the community.</p>
<p>The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm
founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials
promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent
positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction
and electrical jobs to build the facility.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022,
hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green
space.</p>
<p>But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping
out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for
the Plaza 500 project.</p>
<p>When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held
protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to
their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were
largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in
September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter
zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under
the old rules.</p>
<p>Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the
already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia
in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by
2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates
also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every
day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray
also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help
power the data centers’ hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this
story.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how a general resident, even someone who has been
engaging intently on an issue,” Ray said, “has any chance to go up
against the data center industry.”</p>
<p>Local leaders say data centers a financial boon</p>
<p>For local governments, attracting data centers to their
municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said
in 2024 that Virginia’s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in
tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech
companies that own them in 2023.</p>
<p>For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of
direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently
that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000
residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center
advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction,
technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In
that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730
indirect jobs.</p>
<p>Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her
estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax
County should reap the benefits.</p>
<p>“I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the
big picture,” Smith said. “Data centers are not going away.”</p>
<p>Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon </p>
<p>On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon
Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the
4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland
flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia
river.</p>
<p>Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in
property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a
$66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in
two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another
$1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.</p>
<p>That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and
bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a
new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras,
and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.</p>
<p>Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals.
Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials
allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a
company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the
data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics
complaint against them.</p>
<p>Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the
relationships between the company and local officials, and raised
eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an
estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build
five new data centers.</p>
<p>Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS
officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant
in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.</p>
<p>The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a
commissioner. “They said, ‘Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what
you need. Tell us what we can do for you,’” Doherty recalled. Other
former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS
didn’t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.</p>
<p>“We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate
around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a
community’s goals,” said Kevin Miller, AWS’ Vice President of global
data centers. “This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve
those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good
neighbors.”</p>
<p>Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said
they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new
data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to
negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of
AWS-suited lawyers.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to blow it up. We didn’t want to run them off,” said
Lindsay. “But there were better deals to be made.”</p>
<p>Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their
direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.</p>
<p>“This road right here? Wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t for AWS,” said
Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe’s cruiser, pointing out
the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.
Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to
authorize tax breaks for AWS.</p>
<p>“These companies would not be here if they weren’t getting some kind
of incentive,” Stokoe said. “There wouldn’t be any money to talk
about.”</p>

House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in
Syria now are to ensure the country’s conflict does not encourage a
resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a
“humanitarian catastrophe.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the
“extraordinary events in Syria” are in touch with regional partners, the
White House said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the
extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with
regional partners,” the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Spillover “is a concern,” said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also
known as ISIS.</p>
<p>In previous phases of Syria’s long-running civil war, “at its worst,
we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,” he said at a conference in
Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum.</p>
<p>The main priority is to ensure “that the fighting in Syria not lead
to a resurgence of ISIS,” Sullivan said. “We are going to take steps
ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the
Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working
with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the
AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would
affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. “It’s still too
early to tell,” he said.</p>
<p>What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in
Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the
Reagan event.</p>
<p>Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they
have begun to encircle Syria’s capital, Damascus.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies
Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, “who would potentially
face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we’re in
touch with them every day.”</p>
<p>Washington is also alert to stopping a “humanitarian catastrophe,
both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in
terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,”
Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to
take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying … to reconstitute to
a certain extent.”</p>
<p>So the United States will seek to “contain the potential violence and
instability,” protect allies and ensure that ISIS not “get new oxygen
out of this” that could lead them to threaten US or allies’ interests,
Sullivan added.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of
power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated
Biden in November’s election.</p>
<p>Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement
in Syria, saying the country is “a mess” and “not our friend.”</p>
<p>“THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Sullivan, addressing Trump’s remarks, agreed, saying “the United
States is not going to… militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian
civil war.”</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms
equipment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next
week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for
U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms
firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to
address security risks.</p>
<p>The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other
provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese
efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence
assessment of the current status of China’s biotechnology
capabilities.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure
equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously
only approved $1.9 billion for the “rip and replace” program.</p>
<p>Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and
other Chinese gear from their wireless networks.</p>
<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S.
Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to
replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion
shortfall “putting both our national security and the connectivity of
rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.”</p>
<p>She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural
networks shutting down, which “could eliminate the only provider in some
regions” and could threaten 911 service.</p>
<p>Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised
the announcement, saying “funding is desperately needed to fulfill the
mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while
maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that
receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms
equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the
program.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the
program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by
funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced
wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising
spectrum demands of wireless consumers.</p>

id="pearl-harbor-survivors-ages-104-and-102-return-to-hawaii-for-attack-anniversary">Pearl
Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack
anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira “Ike” Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor
attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a
remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that
thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six
weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his
right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a
submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him
from either side.</p>
<p>“I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,” he
said afterward. “I’m getting old, you know.”</p>
<p>Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who
made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National
Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor
had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health
issues.</p>
<p>The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen.
Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS
Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900
Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.</p>
<p>Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has
declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living,
according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state
chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military
historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000
military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.</p>
<p>Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to
salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans.</p>
<p>“He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,” said his daughter
Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their
Beaverton, Oregon, home. “He wanted to be able to stand for that.”</p>
<p>Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack,
serving as the tuba player in the ship’s band. He had showered and put
on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party.</p>
<p>He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS
Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of
sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside.</p>
<p>Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the
ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due
to health issues.</p>
<p>Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time
the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation
flew overhead shortly after.</p>
<p>Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he
lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as
the attack began.</p>
<p>“When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,”
Fernandez said. “We didn’t even know we were in a war.”</p>
<p>Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was
to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast.
Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a
plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly
by.</p>
<p>Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and
other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing
12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to
the ship’s guns.</p>
<p>He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow
sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.</p>
<p>“I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going
on,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>The ship’s guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its
cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into
the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on
fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.</p>
<p>Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its
sailors were injured.</p>
<p>Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t
view himself that way.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hero,” he said. “I’m just nothing but an ammunition
passer.”</p>

ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ auctioned for $28M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy
Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades
ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or
more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55
million, or $1.91 million including the buyer’s premium, a commission
that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the
Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the
slippers, and the company’s web page for the auction had hit nearly
43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it,
the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen “more twists
and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.”</p>
<p>They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of
Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to
smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case.</p>
<p>Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in
2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota,
wasn’t publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023.
He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on
supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served
because of his poor health.</p>
<p>His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin,
who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was
attempting to pull off “one last score” after an old associate with
connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real
jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person
who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass,
DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn’t
specify how.</p>
<p>The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis
suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair
and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He’s scheduled to
go on trial in January and hasn’t entered a plea, though his attorney
has said he’s not guilty.</p>
<p>The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael
Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs
that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to
have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to
click her heels three times and repeat, “There’s no place like
home.”</p>
<p>Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand
Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival
to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to
help the museum purchase the slippers.</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with
the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway
musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
<p>The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz,
such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
