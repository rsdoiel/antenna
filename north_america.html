      <p>Small businesses are feeling the squeeze as tariffs and material costs climb. Rob Lehmann is the founder of Fair Wind Fasteners, a supplier of nuts, bolts, and screws. He explains how fluctuating import costs and trade policies are reshaping his operations. From sourcing metal to keeping prices steady for customers, we hear a firsthand view of what it takes to stay afloat in a volatile economy.

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The U.S. just agreed to spend $20 billion on a currency exchange with Argentina. The hope? To put a lid on inflation before Javier Milei, an ally of President Trump, is up for re-election. How does that work? What’s in it for the U.S.? Later in this episode: AI firms juice the stock market, an economist explains Trump’s flavor of state capitalism, and sports betting sites push the boundary between state and federal regulation.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Tesla unveiled cheaper versions of some of its most popular cars. Other automakers are also promising to discount EVs or roll out more affordable models. This all comes following the end of federal tax credits that knocked as much as $7,500 off the price of a new EV. Also: a proposal that could grant crypto firms access to Fed infrastructure and a check-in with Cuba's tourism minister.</p>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>Kill Bill was born from a collaboration between Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman. Its complex legacy reflects that double-edged origin.</p>

      <h1>Federal funding pullbacks in JD Vance's hometown</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has moved to axe many Biden-era green initiatives. One project impacted is in Middletown, Ohio — the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled. Also on the show: collective bargaining rights for Uber and Lyft drivers in California and a U.S.-Australia alliance concerning rare earth metals.</p>

(date: 2025-10-20)
      <p>
      <p>California has enacted a law requiring rideshare giants Uber and Lyft to collectively bargain with their drivers. Because the drivers are technically independent contractors, they otherwise would not have federally-protected labor rights like full-time employees. The new state law could be a game changer.</p>

(date: 2025-10-17)

      <p>Two midsize U.S. lenders claimed they were victims of loan fraud this week, sending bank stocks into a tailspin. But by close Friday, markets evened out — and for good reason: Regional banks, overall, are actually doing well. In this episode, we dispel the midsize bank sector doomsayers. Plus: Rising auto loan delinquencies could be a consumer debt canary in the coal mine, American culinary sensibilities have moved beyond “foodie” culture, and goats are the star employees in one family's landscaping business.</p>

      <p>Rates on 30-year mortgages fell again this week to an average of 6.27%, according to FreddieMac. That could boost consumer spending on home improvements in 2026, new research finds — and be driven by homeowners locked in with lower rates who recognize that an addition or coat of paint is less daunting than starting over in this housing market.

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. retail and supply chain sectors are slowing down — September’s Logistics Managers’ Index hits its lowest point since March. Many retailers are stopping shipments after stocking up early to avoid tariffs. Ongoing trade uncertainty and rising costs have companies fretting about the long term. Also in this episode: Gen Z plans to spend less this holiday season, tariffs muddle international library lending, and Colorado colleges partner with the private sector to expand skilled jobs training.</p>

      <p>It’s a big week for bank earnings. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported quarterly results on Tuesday; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag.

      <p>Joel Mokyr is a professor at Northwestern University, who — along with Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt — won the Nobel prize in economics earlier this week. Today, Mokyr joins the program to discuss how major technological changes can boost economic growth — that is, if politics and institutions can adapt quickly enough. Plus, why the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings are raising questions about private credit markets and big banks’ exposure to them.</p>

      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab. Marketplace’s Savannah Peters joins Kimberly to explain how tribal communities get caught up in the federal government’s dysfunctional budget process and why tribal leaders argue this needs to change.</p>

      <h1>Fewer Chinese international students at American universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

Plus, delegates are in London for U.N. talks aimed at reducing the environmental impact of global shipping. And, we'll hear about the impact of tariffs on Swiss businesses.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>

      <h1>AI companies are eyeing your shopping cart and your data</h1>

(date: 2025-10-13)
      <p>
      <p>Open AI has added a checkout feature to ChatGPT, partnering with Etsy and Shopify to let users purchase some items from select merchants. OpenAI says ChatGPT's answers are still organic and unsponsored. But why not offer a seamless way to buy things that come up in certain responses?</p>
<p>Eventually this could lead to so-called “agentic” shopping: letting AI research items, pick one, and then buy it on our behalf. Marketplace's Nova Safo spoke with colleague Meghan McCarty Carino about what AI companies stand to gain from integrating e-commerce tech.</p>

      <p>Wanna put a wager on, well, just about anything? Try a prediction market. Competing industry giants Kalshi and Polymarket both saw major investment this week, and for good reason. Though they don’t look it on paper, both function as (extremely lucrative) sports betting platforms but don't face the regulations of sports betting platforms. In this episode, we bet on where that legal loophole is headed. Plus: Expect car sales to sputter as the EV tax credit ends and tariffs drive up costs, and the case for replacing subsidized air travel with a more robust rural bus system.</p>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>Federal programs and funding play an important role in Indian Country, because of the government’s trust responsibility to provide or fund services to tribal nations in exchange for ceded land that now comprises the United States. That relationship also means that shutdowns hit tribal nations particularly hard. We'll learn what that means for services like health care and food distribution programs. Then, a lifelong Las Vegas resident reflects on the city's economic slowdown.</p>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>The ongoing government shutdown has caused a lapse in the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act,a law that's key to protecting the nation against major cyberattacks. Plus, OpenAI this week made a huge investment in chipmaker AMD, the latest in a round of blockbuster deals. And Google said it will be updating its smart home devices with its advanced artificial intelligence, Gemini. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Maria Curi, tech policy reporter at Axios, about all these headlines on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

      <h1>An economic vocab lesson for the Trump era</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today we’re all getting smarter about some of the economic and political terms dominating the headlines these days. Terms like “authoritarianism” and “state capitalism” that have been hotly debated during the second Trump administration.

      <h1>Could airport slowdowns end the shutdown?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

He also hinted that there could be an imminent deal between India and the U.S. on tariffs; India is currently suffering under 50% duties. Also, China has tightened export controls on rare earth metals, which are vital to a range of electronic devices, including military hardware.</p>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>A recent study of nearly 20,000 University of California, San Diego Health workers found cybersecurity training reduced the likelihood of successful phising attacks by just 2%.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Ariana Mirian, senior researcher at the cybersecurity firm Censys and co-author of the study, who explained that many workers are just not taking those training programs seriously enough.</p>

      <p>Just two months ago, the World Trade Organization predicted global trade would grow by nearly 2% next year. Now, it’s revised that forecast down to just 0.5% as the impact of the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs sinks in. We'll hear what's been propping up trade so far and what's on the road ahead. Then, &quot;Marketplace Tech&quot; shares tips for spotting job scams. And later, we'll hear how other countries' &quot;gold card&quot; visa programs fared.</p>

      <h1>Using tariffs to help farmers ... harmed by tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <p>A growing list of U.S. cities are set to see National Guard troops in their communities as President Trump explores ways to deploy the military on American soil. But legal challenges are piling up. On today’s show, Kimberly talks with Patrick Eddington, senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute, about the changing role of the National Guard and why Trump’s use of the Guard defies precedent.</p>

      <h1>The ACA subsides at the heart of the shutdown fight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

Could this be a turning point for the global energy system? Then, London police dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen cell phones.

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Mark Anthony Dyson, author of the Job Scam Report newsletter, about how to spot scams.</p>

      <p>Over the weekend, the White House threatened more layoffs if negotiations between Democrats and Republicans continue to go nowhere. Meanwhile, 100,000 earlier federal layoffs and buyouts finally took effect last week. But stocks hit a record on Friday. What gives? We'll discuss with Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. Plus, a lack of trust in artificial intelligence is hampering its adoption among small and mid-sized businesses.</p>

Then, Jaguar Land Rover plans to resume vehicle production in the U.K. today, six weeks after a cyberattack forced a production pause. And, although the artificial intelligence industry is worth close to $250 billion, some businesses are rejecting its use altogether. We'll hear from them.</p>

      <p>The gap between how high-income and low-income Americans are faring in this economy is growing. One example? Fast food restaurants are struggling while sit-down joints that cater to wealthier customers are A-OK. Also in this episode: “Every Screen on the Planet” author Emily Baker-White talks geopolitics behind the U.S.-China TikTok deal and a Wyoming solar panel company preps for the end of federal subsidies for residential installation.</p>

      <h1>Shutdown has already delayed the jobs report. More critical reports could be held up</h1>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p>The government's monthly jobs report was not published Friday as a result of the federal shutdown. That's left businesses and policymakers in the dark about the strength of the U.S. job market.</p>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p>The September hiring and unemployment data won't be released today due to the ongoing government shutdown. These reports are typically among the five most closely watched economic indicators each month. Economist Julia Coronado of Macropolicy Perspectives joins us to discuss. Also on the show: the shutdown's impact on health care — from canceled online doctor's appointments to reduced home health services for seniors. And later, Marketplace's David Brancaccio speaks with a former high school guidance counselor in Sheboygan, WI about how students are preparing to enter the labor market.</p>

      <h1>A closed federal government means no September jobs report</h1>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p>The partial government shutdown now means two of the top five most important readouts on the economy will not be released on Friday, as scheduled. It's the newest count of the number of people on payrolls and the separate unemployment rate. Later, David speaks with &quot;Marketplace&quot; senior economics contributor Chris Farrell about new research suggesting there may be even more entrepreneurs in the U.S. than current data suggests.</p>

      <h1>Japan prepares to elect a new leader as its economic woes deepen</h1>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will choose a new leader on Saturday, and he or she will become the country's next prime minister. Germany's Munich Airport closed temporarily overnight due to drone sightings, making it the latest European airport forced to halt operations because of unexplained drone flights. And the French government has launched a campaign against what the Minister of Work calls “the last discrimination”: ageism.</p>
