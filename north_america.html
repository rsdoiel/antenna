      <h1>Boosted immigration enforcement is reshaping Latin music festivals</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Latin music is not only popular — it’s big business. But Latin artists are increasingly having their live performances canceled as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts increase and as they encounter visa issues. We'll learn about the economic and cultural impacts. Also on the show: New Mexico will become the first state in the union to offer universal child care, and France's prime minister officially resigns as the country grapples with climbing debt.</p>

      <p>
      <p>American enthusiasm for capitalism is slipping, especially among Democrats. That’s the headline from a new Gallup poll out this week. In this latest survey, just 54% of respondents said they view capitalism positively. That’s down from 60% the last time Gallup asked in 2021. We'll hear more. Plus, we'll get fresh reads on consumer and producer prices this week. How much might these affect a rate cut by the Fed?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> France's push to get a grip on its debt problem is expected to result in the ousting of another prime minister, François Bayrou. President Emmanuel Macron must convince European allies and financial markets that he'll get a debt-reducing budget approved by the end of the year. Plus, as gold continues to hit record highs, London's bullion market is preparing to go digital. And the succession battle at Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has ended with his eldest son, Lachlan, securing control.</p>

      <p>China's exports to the U.S. are down a third year over year. That’s a significant drop, reflective of President Trump’s punishing tariff agenda. Although China’s overall export growth has slowed, it still rose 4.5% in August — thanks, in part, to strategic redirection to new markets. In this episode, what the U.S. stands to lose by cutting off China as a trade partner. Plus: Luxury brands remain mostly insulated from economic uncertainty and fintech firm Robinhood prepares to join the S&amp;P 500.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

This morning, she joins Marketplace's David Brancaccio to discuss safety net programs and financial hardship in rural areas.

Then, French Prime Minister François Bayrou looks set to lose a confidence vote over drastic budget cuts as the country faces mounting debt. And the United Kingdom is trying to tackle the high price of prisoner reoffending; in England and Wales, nearly a third of prison leavers end up back inside, costing the U.K. government around $24 billion annually.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Up to now, bosses and employees in China have frequently bypassed pension regulations in return for higher wages; from this week, however, the rules are being enforced. We'll hear more. Plus, Jaguar Land Rover's embattled management has told staff to stay at home until Tuesday following a cyberattack. And, with fuel prices in Nigeria quadrupling over the last two years, many farmers are now tapping into the sun’s energy to keep water flowing.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has gotten a lot of attention lately — President Trump is attempting to remove one member and has nominated another. But there’s more under the central bank umbrella than president-appointed officials. In this episode, we break down why regional Fed banks and Fed presidents matter. Plus: The latest Beige book shows an uptick in lending, shipping costs are down and an economist walks us through her process for reading a CPI report.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Economic data rolling out this week has helped paint a snapshot of the economy. We found out yesterday that 5.3 million people were hired and 5.3 million quit or were laid off in July. Fresh data out this morning revealed that the private sector added only 54,000 jobs last month. Today, we'll discuss this slowing job growth. Plus, an illegal sports streaming site is shut down, and Texas is restricting the ability of certain foreign nationals to own property.</p>

      <p>There's a black market trade for everything — including ants. (Yes, even ants.) And President Donald Trump has slashed the number of federal government employees, which included entomologists focused on pest control. Today, we'll look at what the illicit ant trade looks like and the sort of environmental and financial costs that can result from invasive species. But first, Trump has his first chance at reshaping the Federal Reserve through the nomination of Stephen Miran.</p>

Thanks to uncertain tariffs, funding cuts, and the immigration crackdown, most companies aren’t eager to hire right now. Even the health care sector is showing some cracks. Also in this episode: The number of American homeowners fell for the first time in a decade, economists explain how the U.S. became the economic data gold standard, and revenue from website ads grow more popular among retailers.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>The big budget bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in July allowed tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to expire. That means health insurance costs will increase significantly for millions, disproportionately hitting small business owners and self-employed people. We’ll learn about the impacts. Also this morning: Retailers have already shifted focus from back-to-school shopping to holiday sales. Thing is, the outlook doesn't look too rosy this year.</p>

      <p>We're talking about companies here, obviously. A decade after Kraft Heinz became one of the world’s biggest food companies, it’s reversing course and is splitting into two. It’s not the only corporation to go this route recently: There’s Warner Bros Discovery, which is separating into two media companies, and Honeywell, which is separating into three. What's behind all this restructuring? Also on the show: renewed interest in IPOs and promised safety improvements from OpenAI.</p>

      <p>“Commercial paper” is a type of short-term debt that’s paid off much faster than a typical corporate bond.

Plus: Iconic millennial-focused brands pivot to Gen Z consumers, the BLS cares if you’ve got free time, and the Trump White House closely monitors U.S. chip manufacturing progress.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

The decision is on hold until mid-October, giving the White House time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This morning, we'll parse which tariffs are affected and which aren't. Plus, a lack of trade deals is weighing on American farmers, and caps on federal student loan borrowing will go into effect next year.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service: </em>Nestlé boss Laurent Freixe left after the company said he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with an employee; his departure threatens more volatility for the company, which has struggled with lower consumer demand and disruptive U.S. tariffs. Then, Kim Jong Un is making a rare trip outside of North Korea, arriving in China as Xi Jinping hosts Vladimir Putin and other leaders. Plus, one Swiss town weighs rebuilding post-avalanche.</p>

      <h1>No, private data can't replace the BLS</h1>

      <p>
      <p>As the Trump administration strips away federal data collection agencies' funding and pressures statisticians to produce positive reports, we might wonder whether private data can fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, while statistics reported by the private sector have a place in our economic understanding, they're not necessarily comprehensive, transparent, or free. Also in this episode: EVs see record sales ahead of tax credit end date, Chinese AI firms meet at a conference in Shanghai, and regional Feds give tariff uncertainty updates.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>Car dealerships always feel the fluctuations of inflation, gas prices, and interest rates. Now, tariffs are added to the mix, hitting their bottom lines at a time when consumers are wary about the future of the economy. In an industry that already contends with relatively slim margins, we'll hear how car sellers are faring. But first, we'll delve into the Federal Reserve's dilemma: worry more about the job market or price increases?</p>

      <p>Summer travel is usually supposed to be a major time for the tourism industry. But this year, budget-conscious American travelers are adjusting their vacation plans. Consumers are actually taking more trips than initially anticipated, but they're tending to be shorter, less expensive, and later in the summer than usual.

      <p>
      <p>We're continuing to follow President Donald Trump's campaign against U.S. central bank independence. His move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud has now been challenged by a lawsuit from Cook. Fed independence has been a strength of the U.S. financial system, but what happens if that disappears? We turn to Hungary as a case study. Plus, consumers spend on tech, and we discuss the latest inflation reading.</p>

The Fed controls the Federal Funds Rate, which is currently at around 4.5%; the president wants it down to 1%. So, what if that happened? We'll outline the ripple effects.

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It's a tough day for India. Most of its exports to the United States will now face a 50% tariff. It's a major shift between the two countries, which used to be partners, especially in tech and defense. We'll learn about the impacts. Plus, European carmakers are claiming that hitting the EU’s 2035 CO2 emissions targets is no longer realistic. Plus, a K-pop-themed musical has become the most-watched movie on Netflix.</p>

      <h1>Can the president remove a Fed governor?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <p>
      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan and Australia are among the latest countries suspending some postal deliveries to the United States. And it's all down to confusion over tariffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month ending the global import tax exemption on small packages worth under $800 entering the U.S. duty-free, a change due to take effect on Friday. Also, Boeing and Korean Air have announced a deal worth $36 billion for over 100 planes.</p>

But today, Intel responded with a regulatory filing, outlining all of the ways this deal could go sideways. We take a look at the unintended consequences of governments owning companies. Also on the show: why prices have been slow to rise in response to tariffs and what to expect from the fall retail season.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>After celebratory markets late last week following indications that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at its September meeting, this week is starting with a bit of a headache. Markets are eager for a rate cut, but signs of a weaker labor market and uncertainty from tariff and immigration policy are complicating the economic picture. Then, Australia is hoping to ease the rare earths bottleneck after China said it's tightening controls on mining and processing.</p>

      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip? Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump recently demanded that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook resign after she was accused of mortgage fraud. In a statement, Cook said she has no intention of being "bullied to step down" and that she's "gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions." We'll hear more. Plus, a weakening labor market sets the backdrop for the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference, and Microsoft's AI chief voices concerns about "AI psychosis."</p>

      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak tomorrow in Jackson Hole, and we'll be watching for hints about the future of interest rates. But one tricky part of the inflation equation? Rent. Higher interest rates have kept many would-be homebuyers in the rental market, which boosted overall demand and pushed rents higher. Then, just how stable are stablecoins? We'll provide an update on the state of play in the crypto market.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The impact of U.S. tariffs is already starting to hit consumers' pocketbooks. Imports from Japan to the United States have been subject to a 15% tariff for three weeks, and now Japanese electronics company Sony is bumping the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles by $50 — but only in the U.S. Also on today's show: concerns over AI psychosis and scrutiny over French mineral water.</p>

      <p>The prestigious Santa Fe Indian Market draws over 1,000 Indigenous artists from more than 200 tribal nations each year, including First Nations, Inuit, and Métis artists from Canada. But this year, economic policies from the Trump administration have complicated things for those traveling from north of the border. We'll chat with a few artists. Also on the show: India and China will restart direct flights, and mortgage rates dip, but not enough to boost demand.</p>

      <p>In this uncertain economy, employers want to save where they can. That’s likely why Starbucks just joined a growing list of companies to shift from merit-based raises to a flat percentage raise. In this episode, why a flat raise structure tends to be cheaper and less time consuming than merit increases — even though everyone gets ‘em. Plus: China leans into trade with developing nations, President Trump wants to cut funding for flights to rural airports, and homebuilder sentiment stays low.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>
