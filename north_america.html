<h2 id="the-data-dogs">The data dogs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Market Place</p>
<p>
Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,
counts himself as a data dog. It’s a name for economic policymakers who
take the long view and are usually game to wait for more numbers.
Goolsbee spoke with “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal about his voracious
appetite for information and what he calls “the hardest thing that a
central bank has to do.” Plus: Sports ticket prices are up 10% in the
last year, and California requires retailers to help fund textile
recycling.

Total damages from Hurricane Helene in the United States could cost

billion.</a> But only a small fraction of homeowners have flood
insurance. As another major hurricane looms, we’ll unpack why coverage
is becoming so expensive that many Americans choose to go without. Plus,
some news you can use about communicating during an emergency, and how
zoo workers and animals ride out big storms.

<h2 id="evaluating-the-damage">Evaluating the damage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Market Place</p>
<p>
As the Southeast assesses Hurricane Helene’s damage, Milton barrels
toward Florida’s west coast. The proximity of the storms will make it
harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one’s impact — and
likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds
shine after the Fed’s rate cut, the mortgage rate honeymoon is over and
Nebraska’s elections attract major campaign spending — along with some
odd yard signs.

<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Market Place</p>

Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping
up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from
Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more
damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the
economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be
prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed’s interest rate cut raised
business owners’ optimism and China invites more young Americans to
visit.

Almost half of adults in the U.S. are single. But so many of our
economic policies and financial systems, from homeownership to
retirement planning, cater to couples. Today’s episode is an excerpt
from a Marketplace live show in Denver, hosted by “Make Me Smart”
co-host Kimberly Adams, on the economics of being single. Kimberly is
joined by a panel of experts who break down the financial challenges
(and perks) of living the single life, and the power of pushing back
against the societal pressures to pair up.

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war a year ago, the U.S. has spent
at record
<a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/IndirectDeathsGaza">$17.9
billion</a> on military aid to Israel — more than any other year since
this aid started. This adds to the already heavy human toll of the
conflict. We’ll discuss the mounting costs of war. Plus, Anthony Fauci’s
new warning about a mosquito-borne illness. And, is the pumpkin spice
tax real?

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, firms have taken some unprecedented
measures to balance out the effects of lockdown, inflation and supply
chain backups, leaving some economic predictors sorta … off. How can
forecasters do their jobs when so many economic patterns have changed?
Also in this episode: The Author’s Guild announces an anti-AI marketing
strategy, consumer credit climbs, and for some agents, the National
Association of Realtors settlement was the last straw.
