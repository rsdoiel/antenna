      <h1>Two dozen states sue Trump administration over potential food stamp cuts – US politics live</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>State officials ask federal judge to force Washington to use emergency reserve funds so 42 million Americans on food stamps will not lose their benefits on 1 November</p>
<p>In <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102528_Department-of-Justice.pdf">a letter</a> this morning, James Comer, the House oversight chair, has asked the justice department to investigate whether Joe Biden’s aides improperly used an autopen to sign executive actions, claiming the former president’s inner circle concealed his cognitive decline while exercising presidential authority without authorization.</p>
<p>“While President Biden’s deterioration was evident to the American people, and consequently, robust systems should have been put in place to document executive actions reflected the actual will of the president, the President’s inner circle took no action to establish such a record,” Comer wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>Researchers in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> have uncovered what they believe are some of the earliest written notes in western musical history – on a ninth-century manuscript they say remained “hidden in plain sight” for years in the hands of a private collector.</p>

      <p>More than half of homeowners say their insurance premiums went up in the last year, according to Consumer Reports. The biggest culprits? Inflation, construction costs, and extreme weather. In response, Consumer Reports has drawn up what it calls a &quot;Homeowners Insurance Bill of Rights,&quot; which it hopes will be adopted by states around the country. Today, we'll hear more. But first, Elon Musk has released an artificial intelligence-powered rival to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving. Welcome to the International Series.</p>

<p>The co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s has accused its owner of being part of a movement of “corporate butt kissing” of Donald Trump and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza.</p>
<p>Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on free speech” by blocking the development of a special flavour in solidarity with the Palestinian people. It is understood the flavour had been approved by Ben &amp; Jerry’s independent board and first mooted about a year ago.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on interest rates today. Most of the government data the Fed usually considers when voting on rates isn’t available because of the shutdown. We did get a tardy consumer price index report last Friday, though, and the Fed also produces some data itself. But can that paint a clear enough economic picture? Also: why workplace insurance premiums are likely to climb.</p>

      <p>The former Raiders quarterback’s career was shortened by off-field issues. In his new book, he looks back at a complicated life</p>
<p>Marcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.</p>
<p>Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school. When Marinovich reached the NFL, it wasn’t just marijuana he was abusing.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.</p>
<p>When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has given conflicting answers to whether he will attempt to run for a third term in 2028. At first he said he hadn't really thought about it, but then went on to say he would be allowed to run as vice-president in 2028 if he wanted to. When pressed by a reporter asking whether he would rule out running for a third term, he said cryptically: ‘I mean you'll have to tell me.’ Later in the interview, however, he said he would rule out running as vice-president, saying: 'I think it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that'</p>

      <p>President has not definitively ruled out seeking to extend time in office. Key US politics stories from Monday 27 October at a glance</p>

</ul>
<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the president has openly expressed interest in finding a way to stay in power beyond the two terms allowed in the US constitution. But his remarks on Monday provided more details into some MAGA minds’ thought process about how to pull it off.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said: “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p>

Also, even if we don't get an inflation report, consumers are still pinched by rising prices. And, will Canada's transportation systems be ready for the FIFA World Cup next year?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.</p>
<p>“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">trade war truce</a> with the Chinese president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>.</p>

      <h1>Why people see tariff-induced inflation differently</h1>

(date: 2025-10-27)
      <p>
      <p>Price increases are price increases, and consumers will bemoan inflation no matter the cause, right? Maybe not so much. Research shows that consumers tend to view inflation brought on by tariffs in a different light. Today, University of Chicago economist Alex Imas joins the program and uses behavioral economics to help make sense of it. But first, Louisiana will be building the first “rare earths separation facility” in the U.S.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p>
<p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p>
<p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p>

      <h1>ICE detains British journalist after criticism of Israel on US tour</h1>

(date: 2025-10-26)
      <p>
      <p>Trump ally Laura Loomer took credit for Sami Hamdi’s detainment in move denounced as ‘affront to free speech’</p>
<p>The British journalist <a href="https://x.com/SALHACHIMI/status/1920429867071365310?t=IZFPhDZHDqy6sA3yvbhRfA&amp;s=19">Sami Hamdi</a> was reportedly detained on Sunday morning by federal immigration authorities at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> international airport, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) says that action is apparent retaliation for the Muslim <a href="https://x.com/SALHACHIMI/status/1920429867071365310?t=IZFPhDZHDqy6sA3yvbhRfA&amp;s=19">political commentator</a>’s criticism of Israel while touring the US.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cair.com/press_releases/breaking-cair-calls-on-ice-to-release-sami-hamdi-british-journalist-abducted-over-criticism-of-israels-genocide/">statement</a> from Cair said it was “a blatant affront to free speech” to detain Hamdi for criticizing Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza while he engaged on a speaking tour in the US. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> official added in a separate statement that Hamdi was facing deportation.</p>

      <h1>President Trump axes trade talks with Canada</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has abruptly cut off all trade talks with America’s northern neighbor. Trump was responding to an anti-tariff ad paid for by the province of Ontario, which featured a clip of former President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. About three-quarters of Canada's exports go to the U.S.; many now face a 35% Levy. Plus, it’s been a turbulent week for gold prices, but what’s causing the recent downturn?</p>

      <p>OpenAI released its new web browser, Atlas, in a bid to become our main conduit to the internet. Plus, we learned this week that Amazon may be planning to expand its use of robots and shrink its use of humans at its warehouses. And this week's disruptive outage at Amazon Web Services reminded us of just how much we depend on cloud computing, even for a good night's sleep. Marketplace’s Nova Safo discussed all of this with Jewel Burks Solomon, managing partner at the venture firm Collab Capital, for this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

      <h1>The NBA jumped into bed with gambling. Now the league is getting its due</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>The arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gambling</p>
<p>The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.</p>
<p>Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims">were arrested Thursday</a> in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james">who allegedly provided</a> “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has canceled plans for a deployment of federal troops to San Francisco that had sparked widespread condemnation from California leaders and sent protestors flooding into the streets. The Bay Area region had been on edge after reports emerged the Trump administration was poised to send more than 100 Customs and Border Protection and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city in the East Bay, as part of a large-scale immigration-enforcement plan. It prompted hundreds of protesters to mobilize outside the Coast Guard base</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, many lower-income Americans will depend on LIHEAP, a program that helps them heat their homes. Receiving LIHEAP assistance to keep the heat on was a reality for over 5 million American households in fiscal year 2024. But existing funds are running low, and future funds are stalled during the shutdown. Also: markets react to the continued federal shutdown, and the Trump administration plans to take stakes in several quantum computing companies.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>US vice-president has criticised Israel’s parliament vote on West Bank annexation, calling the move a 'stupid political stunt' after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land Palestinians want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. Speaking on the tarmac of Tel Aviv’s international airport before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, JD Vance insisted that 'the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren't happy about it,' adding:'I personally take some insult to it'</p>

      <p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down.” Trump also claimed that the high tariffs he placed on imports from Brazil are the reason ranchers are doing well, but the reality is more complicated. Today, we'll explore why there’s no quick fix for high beef prices. We'll also learn what role regenerative farming can play in meeting consumers' beef demands going forward.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> In an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine, the United States has announced new sanctions on Russian oil. The sanctions effectively blacklist two of Russia's major oil export companies, and that has big implications for both India and China, which rely heavily on Russian oil imports. And then recent talks to make the shipping industry greener have stalled. So what’s the industry doing to cut emissions?</p>

Later in this episode: AI firms juice the stock market, an economist explains Trump’s flavor of state capitalism, and sports betting sites push the boundary between state and federal regulation.</p>

      <h1>How Indigenous communities are adopting AI</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise for tribal nations — as a force multiplier for hard-to-staff departments, a tool to better serve tribal citizens, and even to aid in the revitalization of Indigenous languages and culture.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration has moved to axe many Biden-era green initiatives. One project impacted is in Middletown, Ohio — the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Environmentalists had hoped that the conversion of a steel plant there from coal to hydrogen-powered furnaces could be a blueprint for future eco-friendly upgrades, but that project has been canceled. Also on the show: collective bargaining rights for Uber and Lyft drivers in California and a U.S.-Australia alliance concerning rare earth metals.</p>

      <p>AI chatbot adoption is moving rapidly. We can already ask the tools to help us find local restaurants, a good deal on an item we’re looking to purchase. And soon, we’ll even be able to buy products from Walmart through ChatGPT. But as more people turn to AI for search and shopping, what happens to small businesses that traditionally depend on web searches and online reviews?</p>

Plus: Recruiters give mixed takes on the job market, oil services companies are up against low prices and a supply glut, and streaming platforms set their sights on video games and podcasts.</p>

Farmers and ranchers can see their entire livelihoods turn on one bad hailstorm or ill-timed heat wave, which are more frequent as our planet continues to warm. Today, we'll head to Colorado to hear about an apprenticeship program that's embedding climate literacy into its teachings. But first: the value of the dollar, this morning's web outages, and pain for small- and mid-sized businesses.</p>

(date: 2025-10-17)
      <p>
      <p>Two midsize U.S. lenders claimed they were victims of loan fraud this week, sending bank stocks into a tailspin. But by close Friday, markets evened out — and for good reason: Regional banks, overall, are actually doing well. In this episode, we dispel the midsize bank sector doomsayers. Plus: Rising auto loan delinquencies could be a consumer debt canary in the coal mine, American culinary sensibilities have moved beyond “foodie” culture, and goats are the star employees in one family's landscaping business.</p>

That could boost consumer spending on home improvements in 2026, new research finds — and be driven by homeowners locked in with lower rates who recognize that an addition or coat of paint is less daunting than starting over in this housing market.

      <h1>FCC cuts expansion to broadband, hotspot access</h1>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>Before the government shutdown, the Federal Communications Commission voted to end funding for Wi-Fi on school buses and the lending of hotspot devices from libraries. Nicol Turner Lee, author of “ <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/digitally-invisible/">Digitally Invisible</a>,” said this could further the digital divide for marginalized communities.</p>

Recent earnings reports showed banks including Citibank and JPMorgan beat revenue expectations and grew at a clip over the past few months. In this episode, why banks are thriving as regulations loosen and the economy gets unpredictable. Plus: A growing share of small businesses are raising prices in response to tariffs, Microsoft stopped updating Windows 10, and battery makers weigh pivot from EVs to grid storage.</p>

      <h1>When the government shuts down, tribal communities get the shaft</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab. Marketplace’s Savannah Peters joins Kimberly to explain how tribal communities get caught up in the federal government’s dysfunctional budget process and why tribal leaders argue this needs to change.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

The U.K. government told CEOs to plan offline contingencies after a number of high-profile attacks on companies — hacks that cost global brands millions of dollars. We'll learn more. Plus, delegates are in London for U.N. talks aimed at reducing the environmental impact of global shipping. And, we'll hear about the impact of tariffs on Swiss businesses.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>

      <h1>Trump's tariffs take a toll</h1>

(date: 2025-10-13)
      <p>
      <p>In another wave of tariff news, Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese goods that will take effect in November. The constant back and forth of tariff policy has left import-reliant business owners frustrated, defeated and wondering how long they can hold out.

(date: 2025-10-13)
      <p>
      <p>Marketplace doesn’t always cover the goings-on of the Holy See. But when he highlights the need to combat poverty, it seems like a pretty good time to do so. In his first teaching last week, Pope Leo XIV called into question some basic tenets of mainstream economics and focused on the gap between the rich and the poor. Today, we discuss. Also on the show: the research of Nobel laureate economists and Trump's attempts to calm markets over China trade.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Trade tensions are flaring as Beijing responds to President Donald Trump’s threats to tack an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods. China has warned of &quot;corresponding measures,&quot; though new data shows that China’s exports are booming. So does China still need the U.S.? Then, Nigeria produces nearly 40% of the world's shea nuts, which sustains a multibillion-dollar trade in cosmetics, food, and medicine.

Though they don’t look it on paper, both function as (extremely lucrative) sports betting platforms but don't face the regulations of sports betting platforms. In this episode, we bet on where that legal loophole is headed. Plus: Expect car sales to sputter as the EV tax credit ends and tariffs drive up costs, and the case for replacing subsidized air travel with a more robust rural bus system.</p>

      <h1>Dealing with credit card or medical debt? Here's how to handle it.</h1>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>On today’s show, Kimberly is joined by the host of NPR’s “Life Kit” podcast, Marielle Segarra, who’s recently been working on a four-week newsletter series all about credit card debt — and how to avoid it all snowballing. Plus, we’ll play a round of Headline or Head-lyin’!</p>

      <h1>Why government shutdowns hit tribes especially hard</h1>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>Federal programs and funding play an important role in Indian Country, because of the government’s trust responsibility to provide or fund services to tribal nations in exchange for ceded land that now comprises the United States. That relationship also means that shutdowns hit tribal nations particularly hard. We'll learn what that means for services like health care and food distribution programs. Then, a lifelong Las Vegas resident reflects on the city's economic slowdown.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

      <h1>Filling the federal data void</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A growing list of U.S. cities are set to see National Guard troops in their communities as President Trump explores ways to deploy the military on American soil. But legal challenges are piling up. On today’s show, Kimberly talks with Patrick Eddington, senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute, about the changing role of the National Guard and why Trump’s use of the Guard defies precedent.</p>

      <h1>The ACA subsides at the heart of the shutdown fight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

      <h1>Online job scams are a growing problem</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Mark Anthony Dyson, author of the Job Scam Report newsletter, about how to spot scams.</p>
