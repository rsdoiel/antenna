<p>The US justice department is believed to be reviewing more than 5m pages of documents relating to the disgraced financier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> – an effort that is drawing resources away from existing cases, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/30/us/politics/esptein-files-5-million-pages.html">the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The figure represents a significant expansion on earlier estimates, which drew on calculations based on 300 gigabytes of data, papers, videos, photographs and audio files held within FBI archives that relate to investigations in Florida and New York.</p>

<p>In prisons and jails across the US, people are routinely fed unhealthy, tasteless or inedible meals. Many are left hungry and malnourished, with devastating long-term health consequences. The hidden crisis affecting millions of incarcerated people is the subject of <a href="https://thenewpress.org/books/eating-behind-bars/?v=eb65bcceaa5f">Eating Behind Bars</a>, a new book offering a disturbing account of how correctional institutions punish their residents through the food they provide and withhold.</p>

      <p>Enhanced subsidies for health insurance policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are set to expire at the end of today. That means skyrocketing premiums for some Obamacare enrollees. Premiums are expected to more than double, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, and some healthier people are expected to drop their insurance. Plus, 2025 was the year that generative AI exploded, divided, and created trust issues. We'll take a look back.</p>

      <p>Guardian US readers share how global heating and biodiversity loss affected their lives in ways that don’t always make the headlines</p>
<p>The past year was another one of record-setting heat and catastrophic storms. But across the US, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate crisis</a> showed up in smaller, deeply personal ways too.</p>
<p>Campfires that once defined summer trips were never lit due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires">wildfire</a> risks. There were no bites where fish were once abundant, forests turned to meadows after a big burn and childhood memories of winter wonderlands turned to slush.</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>People who are in default on their federal student loans could start seeing their wages garnished in the new year. Next week, the Department of Education plans to start sending out letters to borrowers who have missed at least nine months of payments, letting them know the government will begin taking 15% from their paychecks. Also, the U.S. Mint pressed the final batch of pennies last month. We examine the penny's 232-year run.</p>

They're demanding better wages and improvements in safety conditions, among other things. We hear more. Then, a British company says it's a step closer to manufacturing materials in space, and we look at the role of AI over the past year.</p>

      <h1>A whiplash year for electric vehicles</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>2025 brought some new speed bumps for electric vehicle sales, namely the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It cut federal EV tax credits — up to <span class="math inline">\(7,500 for new cars and \)</span>4,000 for used ones. Those incentives had been on the books in some form since 2008 and were expanded during the Biden administration. They expired at the end of September.</p>
<p>Consumers rushed to take advantage before they disappeared, leading to <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/">record high sales</a> earlier this year. But now the market faces an uncertain road ahead.</p>
<p>Marketplace's Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with her colleague Henry Epp about the outlook for EV sales in the U.S. now that federal tax credits are gone.</p>

      <h1>Life after LeBron James: who will inherit the NBA’s future?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>As the millennial superstars near the end, an international generation reshapes the league. The question is whether an American can still carry the crown</p>
<p>That the NBA is reckoned in seasons is apt. To measure a legacy this way is as much existential as it is symbolic. Martin Heidegger argued that time is not something we pass through, but the condition of our being – less a pathway than a pressure. Heavy stuff, yes, but the NBA has always operated under similar weight.</p>
<p>The millennial superstars who stabilized the league for two decades are now entering their twilight: LeBron James (who turned 41 on Tuesday), Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul. In their wake comes something genuinely new. For the first time, the league’s next dominant generation is unmistakably international. The NBA’s gen Z elite now emerge from Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Canada and France.</p>

As a result, angry Canadians have united behind a &quot;Buy Canadian&quot; movement that experts say is elevating our own whiskies.</p>

<p>The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it is freezing federal funding for childcare programs in Minnesota after allegations of fraud – first exposed and prosecuted during the Biden administration – recently became the focus of conservative influencers and media outlets.</p>
<p>Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, said in <a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2006136004294664464">a video statement</a> that the funding freeze was in response to what he called “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country … We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Nearly a year after a New Year's Day truck attack on Bourbon Street left 14 dead, New Orleans officials are still seeking permanent security solutions. Ahead of the anniversary of the rampage, officials are ramping up security measures. Some 350 National Guard members arrived Tuesday. The attack happened when a man plowed a truck into revelers before police shot and killed him. The rampage revealed security vulnerabilities surrounding a famous street that is densely populated by bars and pedestrians. A police captain has urged the city to install permanent security gates to prevent future attacks.</p>

<p>A series of December storms delivered a welcome boost to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a>’s snowpack, scientists said on Tuesday in a closely watched assessment of the state’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water">water</a> resources for the year ahead.</p>
<p>The snowpack survey recorded a snow depth of 24in (61cm), said Angelique Fabbiani-Leon, state hydrometeorologist at the California department of water resources’ snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit. The survey was conducted at the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state.</p>

      <p>Home price growth is cooling, new reports show. Though homeowners may be struggling to sell at asking price, it is good news for prospective buyers. Especially those who’ve been waiting on the sidelines for a good deal. But, as with most housing issues, the slowdown is regional. Also in this episode: Auto sales were strong in 2025, Gen Zers see cash in a new light, and an unlikely government funds a U.S.-based GED program for Mexican immigrants.</p>

      <p>Lawyers for Brian Cole argue he should be released ahead of trial for allegedly planting devices in DC in 2021</p>
<p>The man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the headquarters of both the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> national committees the night before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach">January 6 insurrection</a> at the US Capitol appeared at a federal detention hearing before a magistrate judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, authorities arrested Brian Cole Jr of Woodbridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a>. He has yet to enter a plea. Cole’s lawyers argued that he should be released while he awaits trial, as he does not present any danger. They also noted that Cole had agreed to home detention enforced by GPS monitoring, and would live under the supervision of a relative. The defense rebuked federal prosecutors who pushed for the suspect to remain in custody.</p>

      <p>Mamdani to take oath of office on New Year’s Eve in gilded age subway station beneath city hall</p>
<p>While tens of thousands of New Yorkers will be in Times Square for the countdown to 2026, the city’s mayor-elect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, has said he will be sworn into office in an underground midnight private ceremony at an abandoned subway station built during the gilded age.</p>
<p>Mamdani, 34, plans to take the oath of office on New Year’s Eve in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train. The unusual choice of venue for the ceremony, Mamdani said, is symbolically resonant of the “inauguration of a new era”.</p>

<p>A wild winter storm brought strong winds, heavy snow and frigid temperatures to the Great Lakes and north-east on Tuesday, a day after a bomb cyclone barreled across the midwest and left tens of thousands of customers without power.</p>
<p>The storm hit parts of the Plains and Great Lakes on Monday with sharply colder air, strong winds and a mix of snow, ice and rain, leading to treacherous travel. Forecasters said it intensified quickly enough to meet the criteria of a bomb cyclone, a system that strengthens rapidly as pressure drops.</p>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>This morning, we're recapping the 2025 housing market, which was — in a word — sluggish. Even though mortgage rates have come down, affordability remains an issue, and many would-be sellers are locked into ultra-low rates. But economists and real estate agents expect some modest pickup in the year ahead. Then, there's renewed focus on the vulnerability of the global auto supply chain after hackers targeted Jaguar Land Rover in September.</p>

In response, shopkeepers in the capital, Tehran, have been demonstrating for a third successive day. Plus, this year's hack at British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover showed just how vulnerable the global auto supply chain could be.</p>

<p>The technology's tendency to affirm what people say can result in conversations that become untethered from reality and, in the worst cases, has ended with real-world harms. Kashmir Hill has been reporting on this phenomenon for The New York Times.</p>

      <h1>Online school and junior tennis: freedom, focus – and a quiet cost</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Elite junior tennis players are flocking to online schools. The model offers flexibility and focus – but raises deeper questions about growth, pressure and childhood</p>
<p>In a major study <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html">released recently in Epidemiology</a>, conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.</p>
<p>Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building. I often find myself bonding with the few other parents whose kids remain in regular school as we’re a rapidly dwindling species.</p>

      <h1>‘Be fearful when others are greedy’: Warren Buffett’s sharpest lessons in investing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals</p>
<p>Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway">who is retiring at the end of 2025</a>, has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.</p>
<p>Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with <span class="math inline">\(25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than \)</span>1tn.</p>
<p>Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.</p>
<p>My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).</p>
<p>Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’</p>
<p>When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.</p>
<p>Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)</p>
<p>In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.</p>
<p>Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.</p>
<p>From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.</p>
<p>When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend <em>my</em> 100th.</p>
<p>She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)</p>
<p>The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.</p>
<p>(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)</p>

<p>Bijan Robinson rushed for 195 yards, including a 93-yard touchdown, Zane Gonzalez kicked a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds remaining and the Atlanta Falcons recovered after blowing two 21-point leads to upset the playoff-bound Los Angeles Rams 27-24 on Monday night.</p>
<p>Robinson’s <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2005828580815536411">93-yard touchdown run</a> was the longest in Atlanta history and Jessie Bates III scored on a 34-yard interception return. Bolstered by those big plays, the Falcons led 21-0 at halftime and 24-3 early in the second half.</p>

<p>For much of the last two years, the U.S. Democratic Party has been on its back foot, enduring painful electoral defeats to an omnipresent Republican opponent while grappling with a troubling decline in voter registration and a listless party base.

      <p>The housing market is showing modest improvement, with pending home sales rising over 3% in November and prices growing just 1.2% year over year. Rising inventory and falling mortgage rates mean affordability is improving, though rates likely need to dip below 6% for demand to really pick up.

      <p>Trump also repeated false claims about renovation costs for the Fed headquarters during a Monday press conference</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> launched another attack against Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Monday, calling the central banker a “fool” and once again suggesting he would like to fire him.</p>
<p>Trump launched his latest attack on Powell during a press conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeating false claims about the cost of a renovation of the central bank headquarters, and told reporters that he might file a lawsuit against Powell for “gross incompetence”.</p>

      <h1>Trump says ‘there’ll be hell to pay’ if Hamas does not disarm as he meets Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago – as it happened</h1>

<p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> is expected to tell <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on Monday that <strong>Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented</strong>, Israeli officials and analysts say.</p>
<p>The trip comes amid a <strong>new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel</strong> to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, which began in October after two years of devastating war.</p>
<p>He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.</p>
<p>Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the [Trump] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.</p>

      <h1>US pledges $2bn in new UN model for delivery of humanitarian assistance</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official</p>
<p>The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.</p>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Toxic chemicals like lead and asbestos are likely in dirt used to backfill demolished structures in city, experts say</p>
<p>Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites were <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2025/12/22/toxic-dirt-detroitland-bank-cleanup/87881313007/">potentially backfilled</a> with toxic construction debris from a demolished shopping mall and other sources, creating an unfolding public health threat in the city’s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Detroit, the nation’s lowest income big city, is in the US industrial heartland. It was left with tens of thousands of empty structures as industrial plants closed and people left the city in past decades – Detroit’s population dropped from nearly 2 million people around 1950 to fewer than 700,000 today. The city’s demolition program is widely considered the largest ever in the US.</p>

      <h1>The Las Vegas Raiders and the thin line between tanking and incompetence</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas shut down their two stars, angered their leader and were humiliated by the Giants. Whether it’s strategy or dysfunction, the result looks the same</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders made waves this week by putting its two, and only, stars on injured reserve ahead of the final two games that will decide the 2026 NFL draft order. Tight end Brock Bowers and edge rusher Maxx Crosby were shut down from a consequential battle for the top draft pick against the Giants and a Week 18 game against Kansas City due to nagging knee injuries. Bowers had scored four touchdowns over the past five weeks for a team that doesn’t score many points. Crosby is a human wrecking ball who has amassed 28 tackles for loss this season. He’s the player that causes opponents to lose sleep. Both Bowers and Crosby were recently named to the Pro Bowl despite their nagging injuries. Bowers stepped away quietly. Crosby did not.</p>
<p>A fuming Crosby left the Raiders facility Friday. The next day he <a href="https://x.com/MLFootball/status/2005116248653447578?s=20">sent a message to the organization</a> by posting videos of himself playing basketball with his young daughter. He did not appear particularly injured.</p>

      <p>Other outlets have asked their writers to compromise, but the Guardian has never – and would never – ask me to pull a punch</p>

<p>It might be most generous to characterize the behavior of major US media organizations since 2024 as negotiating between competing incentives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, billionaires have consolidated their ownership over major news outlets and platforms. The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.</p>

      <h1>Why haven’t Trump’s tariffs crashed the US economy? | Jeffrey Frankel</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Effects on inflation and employment have not been as bad as feared – but could still materialise with full force in 2026</p>
<p>When Donald Trump took office last January, most economists feared what would happen if he raised tariffs. The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.</p>
<p>Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violating <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250318_Trump-and-the-World-Economy.pdf?x85095">international</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9ggbn0dgp37jkknk0rxpu/2025-05-13-Jeffrey-Frankel-Taking-a-Sledgehammer-to-US-Global-Leadership-Trump-s-Tariffs.mp4?rlkey=9iw66ek8uh5kyqwnf59ptt6qr&amp;e=2&amp;st=s51qydmr&amp;dl=0ido">agreements</a> and blowing up the Republican party’s <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans">oft-professed</a> commitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of his <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trump-tariffs-economic-cost-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-05">first term</a>, and even beyond the infamous <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm">Smoot-Hawley Act</a> of 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025">average effective tariff</a> on US imports rose from <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/">2% to 18%</a>, the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and large <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trumps-tariffs-cause-recession-experts/story?id=120329597">adverse</a> effects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.</p>

      <h1>‘Just like so many families’: US parents of addicted kids relate to the Reiners – but fear stigma</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>The challenges of drug and alcohol addiction are familiar, but violence against others is highly unusual, parents say</p>
<p>When news broke that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been killed and a possible suspect was their son, Nick Reiner, who had struggled with addiction and mental health issues, it brought addiction back into the public spotlight. But parents who have been affected by their children’s addiction fear the conversation will focus on the exceedingly rare act of violence instead of the more widespread risks.</p>
<p>Ron Grover and his wife, Darlene, have been glued to the news. They only knew the Reiners by their work, but they feel a connection: Grover’s son also became addicted at 15 to opioids and then heroin, much like Nick Reiner, and he was in and out of rehab and jail for years. But after seven excruciating years, Grover’s son got sober in July 2010.</p>

      <p>The progressive party is now active in 18 states and much of its expansion happened in the past five years</p>
<p>The “time has come” for the Working Families party, the progressive third party’s national director said after a year of big wins and a growing hunger among voters for a home outside the two major political parties.</p>
<p>“For 26 years, we’ve been building this argument,” Maurice Mitchell said. “And the argument has met the moment.”</p>

      <p>This year turned out to be a pretty big year for autonomous vehicles. Waymo is the leader in the robotaxi race and over the last year, its signature Jaguar electric vehicles have become a common sight on the streets and recently freeways of cities around the country.</p>
<p>Companies like Uber and Zooks have expanded their fleets to several metropolitan areas. And Tesla finally rolled out its cybercab service in a limited capacity in Austin.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke to Kirsten Korosec, transportation editor at TechCrunch, about how the robotaxi became a common fixture on city streets this year.</p>

      <p>Extraordinary golf was often overshadowed by Donald Trump, colourful fans, crazy MCs and tempers flaring</p>
<p>I was out by the practice green late afternoon on the Monday of the Ryder Cup and so was Bryson DeChambeau. He was on his own, signing autographs for the handful of people on the other side of the railings, and there was this one woman leaning over towards him, a bottle blonde, late middle-aged, in a tight white dress.</p>
<p>She was only a couple of feet away from him, but she was screaming in his ear like she was trying to reach someone across the far side of the course. “We love you Bryson! Bryson! We love you! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald!”</p>

<p>Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.</p>
<p>By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome. When the 2028 Olympics roll around, Inglewood is slated to host many of the events as the world watches.</p>

<p>Mike Turner, an Ohio congressman, said on Sunday that the strikes are a “continuation of our conflict with [the Islamic State]”.</p>

      <p>Cody Adams, 33, charged with manslaughter after neighbor blocks away was killed as he was firing at a drink can</p>
<p>A man in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.</p>
<p>As told in court documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138">NBC News</a>, the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely. Adams’s back yard was not equipped to stop bullets from leaving the property and striking unsuspecting people in the surrounding area, according to authorities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/democrats-trump-elections">Democrats’ soul-searching</a> began even before it was clear Donald Trump would return to the White House. But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.</p>
<p>One diagnosis, however, drew striking consensus: Democrats had allowed themselves to be drowned out online by the right’s vast – and well-funded – digital army.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 years ago, a 13-year-old boarded a tiny fishing boat from communist Vietnam with more than a hundred other people. His intended destination: anywhere but there. The boat drifted through the Pacific Ocean for three days and four nights, dodging violent storms,massive waves, even a pirating ship. For the entirety of the journey, the teenager had no food or water.</p>
<p>He survived the voyage, later took shelter in a Malaysian refugee camp, and was eventually granted asylum in the United States.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The California Democrat believes common ground does not only lie in the center – and has the successes to prove it</p>
<p>It was mid-December, and Ro Khanna was watching the calendar. The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed. And when the deadline arrived, while the justice department didn’t release everything, thousands of new files, connections and photographs began to complete the picture on what Khanna calls “the Epstein class … rich and powerful men who still have buildings named after them, who still are on corporations, are still in positions of prestige, who engage in heinous conduct.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine. From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> – to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.</p>

<p>Overdoses have been declining nationally since the fall of 2023, and public health experts have been unable to agree as to why. The decline has been uneven across states, and West Virginia, long known as the epicenter of the opioid crisis, is also among the states that have most reduced overdose fatalities, as noted in a recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis">Guardian</a> analysis.</p>
<p>One little explored factor is the increased adoption of crisis intervention training (CIT) for law enforcement. Early <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772998/pdf/qxaf003.pdf">research that compares jurisdictions</a> that have CIT programs to those that do not show that this intervention is associated with a decline in overdose fatalities.</p>

      <p>Rule allows minority party to block legislation, but GOP is reluctant to scrap it as they could lose majority</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has floated the idea of ending the filibuster – a procedural technique in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a> that allows a minority of senators to block legislation from passing – which would make pushing through his political agenda in 2026 much easier.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Long-winded legal wrangling and recalcitrant Catholic church leadership thwarted hopes for timely settlement</p>
<p>An image of his great-grandmother stayed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/new-orleans-clergy-abuse-survivors-judge">James Adams</a> for years and strengthened his faith: she was withered, nearly blind, touching his cheeks when they sat together, as if the feel of his face gave her sight. A working woman whose husband, a police officer, killed himself, she raised four children; her faith was a rock against life’s travails. She died at 98, when Adams was 28, about to marry.</p>
<p>Many years later, in 2020, Adams, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> banker, was president of the Catholic Community Foundation, the archdiocese’s fundraising arm, when Archbishop Gregory Aymond ousted him – as he’s recounted from a witness stand in court and in multiple media interviews. Overnight, Adams became a church enemy because of what a priest did to him as a boy. His story mirrors the legal saga that has tarnished Aymond’s career.</p>

<p>While traditional marches such as the massive <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o">No Kings</a> protests are a critical part of any resistance movement, sociologist Doug McAdam has shown how <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095322">tactical innovation</a> – the introduction of creative or novel protest methods – was a key part of the success of the civil rights movement in the US.

<p>“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.</p>

      <h1>The ascendant San Antonio Spurs are the gift the NBA needed</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>By puncturing Oklahoma City’s aura of inevitability, Victor Wembanyama and co have restored suspense, drama and joy to a season that was in danger of becoming dull</p>
<p>I’ve seen enough: Give the San Antonio Spurs the keys to Santa Claus’ workshop. Put Stephon Castle in charge of toy assembly. Let De’Aaron Fox toss presents into chimneys, from whatever range he’d like. Devin Vassell can customize the Christmas cookies. Harrison Barnes has the army of elves covered. And, of course, Santa Claus’s sleigh must immediately be resized for a taller, thinner pilot so that the towering Victor Wembanyama can drive it comfortably. The sensational Spurs have felled the Oklahoma City Thunder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/nba-christmas-games-scores">three times in two weeks</a>, and in doing so revitalized this NBA season. I now have more faith in the Spurs’ ability to grant joy to the masses than any holiday legends of old.</p>
<p>It looked dire for a while there. The Thunder might have won the Larry O’Brien trophy in June, but began this season in even more ominous form. They reeled off 24 wins in their first 25 games (the lone loss was a fluky 20-point comeback). In most of them, Jalen Williams, their second-best player, was on the sidelines recovering from wrist surgery. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, their best, seldom had to play in fourth quarters. The Thunder beat the Sacramento Kings by 31. The Los Angeles Lakers, who some expected to be a plausible rival, lost by 29; their basketball savant Luka Doncic looked like he was playing against ten men. The Phoenix Suns’ valiant first earned them a close loss, by just four points. When they met again 12 days later, the Thunder won by 49. This game knocked all the remaining leaves off the trees and started winter 10 days ahead of schedule. Oklahoma City looked capable of shredding anything in its path, even the 2016 Golden State Warriors’ legendary regular season record of 73-9.</p>

      <h1>Epstein texts and yelling at Trump: US House’s year of censures</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Lawmakers spent much of 2025 seeking to reprimand each other – here’s a look back at what sparked such outrage</p>
<p>It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers broke the record for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/hakeem-jeffries-house-speech-trump-tax-bill">longest floor speech</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/house-breaks-longest-vote-record-genius-act">longest vote</a>, and presided over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">the lengthiest government shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>They also spent plenty of time seeking to reprimand each other by passing censures, as the House’s formal mechanism for discipline is known. A search on Congress.gov reveals at least 17 attempts since the start of the year to condemn another lawmaker, in the form of a censure or a less formal disapproval resolution.</p>

<p>Thomas Massie then successfully sought donations for his run for another term in the 2026 midterm elections against an opponent that Trump – his fellow Republican – has already endorsed.</p>

It's a move that's boosted business for logistics companies but has hit some smaller businesses at home and abroad hard. This morning, we'll learn outline the effects the change has had.

<p>In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”.</p>

      <h1>Rise of the return fee</h1>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>Now that Christmas presents are unwrapped, many of you — you know who you are — will head to stores to return gifts and get what you actually want. But increasingly, retailers are charging for those returns. Then, a couple of months ago, more than 5 million shoppers embraced a boycott of three major retailers: Amazon, Home Depot, and Target. From <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/this-is-uncomfortable-reema-khrais">&quot;This Is Uncomfortable,&quot;</a> we'll learn about the impact it had on shoppers.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>The president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmed</p>
<p>For more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.</p>
<p>But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv">The Apprentice</a>, appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.</p>

      <p>Texas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSD</p>
<p>For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.</p>
<p>Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> There's one word that's dominated the headlines this year: tariffs. Countries around the world have been grappling with the U.S. import taxes central to President Donald Trump's trade policy, so how are countries faring? We check in on Mexico, China, and others. Plus, the Trump administration eliminated the tax exemption for parcels under $800 this year. We investigate how the move is playing out four months on.</p>

<p>The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.</p>
<p>It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.</p>

Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the onslaught was part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

      <p>Imran Ahmed, an anti-disinformation advocate, claims he is being targeted for scrutinising social media companies</p>
<p>A British anti-disinformation campaigner close to Keir Starmer’s chief of staff has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration after being told he could face deportation from the US in a row over freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), has filed a complaint against senior Trump allies including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, in an attempt to prevent what he says would be an unconstitutional arrest and removal.</p>

      <p>Are her recent candid remarks about Trump an attempt to distance herself from an increasingly unpopular president?</p>
<p>She was now one of the family. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> addressed supporters in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in early December, <a href="https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1998551432350544325?s=20">he asked</a>: “Susie Trump – do you know Susie Trump? Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles.”</p>
<p>The US president was referring to his chief of staff, who he said had persuaded him to return to the campaign trail ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. But a week later, Wiles appeared at risk of becoming the family outcast.</p>

<p>Trump’s first and second terms have been marked by huge protests, from the 2017 Women’s March to the protests for racial justice after George Floyd’s murder, to this year’s No Kings demonstrations.

<p>According to historians and political scientists who study protest: very. From emancipation to women’s suffrage, from civil rights to Black Lives Matter, mass movement has shaped the arc of American history. Protest has led to the passage of legislation that gave women the right to vote, banned segregation and legalized same-sex marriage. It has also sparked cultural shifts in how Americans perceive things like bodily autonomy, economic inequality and racial bias.</p>

      <h1>I was there: Rory McIlroy’s Masters triumph was the ultimate moment</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>It felt like nothing would top Tiger Woods’s Masters win, but then the Northern Irishman completed his career grand slam on an extraordinary final day at Augusta</p>
<p>At 7am on 14 April in an Augusta rental home, Rory McIlroy awoke and immediately spotted a Green Jacket draped over a chair. “You think: ‘Yeah, that did happen yesterday,’” he says. “That.” McIlroy was now the sixth man to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/14/rory-mcilroy-secures-career-grand-slam-after-dramatic-masters-playoff-win-over-justin-rose">win all four of golf’s majors</a>.</p>
<p>The detail of what lay around in the bedroom of my own Augusta billet is of no interest to anybody. That was, however, a memorable morning. I had previously and wrongly believed nothing would top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/14/masters-tiger-woods-molinari-finau-schauffele-koepka">Tiger Woods’s 2019 Masters win</a> in respect of seismic reaction. Scores of messages from friends, colleagues, family members – umpteen of whom have no interest whatsoever in golf – had landed. Broadcast outlets across the world wanted my assessment of what had played out on Masters Sunday. Yeah, that did happen yesterday.</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>More than a year after the storm ripped apart families and farms, growers are bullish about strength of their industry</p>
<p>Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year’s devastating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a>, but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we’re in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.</p>

<p>Happy holidays! Across the 12 days of Christmas one very keen individual once gifted their lover a partridge in a pear tree, two turtle doves, three French hens, four calling birds, five gold rings, six geese a-laying, seven swans a-swimming, eight maids a-milking, nine ladies dancing, 10 lords a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming.</p>
<p>An extravagant expression of what was allegedly “true love”, the spree amounted to a total of 364 presents – more if you include the eggs that the geese a-laid.</p>

      <p>
      <p>2025 has been the year of getting dragged back to the office for plenty of workers — some part-time, but many full-time in the case of big finance and tech corporations. Thing is, in-person work appeals to many younger workers. Today, we'll hear the perspective of one. Then, the State Department says it will deny visas to five European citizens, including a former top EU official, and domestic production is still adjusting to tariffs.</p>

      <h1>Fresh ‘manty’ and cheap figs: a post-Soviet supermarket becomes a must-visit spot in NYC</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone</p>
<p>When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like <em>manty</em> – intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or <em>chak-chak</em>, a dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey syrup. <em>Kompot,</em> too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.</p>
<p>Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home. <em>Manty</em> was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin, yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade <em>kompot</em> with fruits and berries from our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered <em>chak-chak</em>, the store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, <a href="https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430">invoking</a> drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.

certain flavours of the frozen snack between early October and late November.</p>

      <h1>Is Trump mentally OK? A look back at the president’s unusual behavior in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity</p>
<p>In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408">claimed</a> that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.</p>
<p>“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.</p>
<p>America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”</p>
<p>I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.</p>
<p>We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”</p>

      <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore Homeland Security funding to 12 states and the District of Columbia. The administration had held back hundreds of millions of dollars from what it called &quot;sanctuary jurisdictions.&quot; The cuts affected programs intended to support local police and emergency response in urban areas. Plus, food banks are bracing for strain ahead of changes to SNAP. We hear how services will be impacted on the ground in Kentucky.</p>

      <h1>Mushrooms could help curb plastic waste</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Polystyrene is the chemical compound that makes up styrofoam, which is used for packaging and insulation. But it’s not the most environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>By one estimate, 40 million tons of polystyrene were produced globally in 2024, leaving millions of tons of plastic waste. The search for an earth-friendly alternative has led researchers to dig deep and come up with an unlikely solution: fungus. The BBC’s Anna Holligan has this story.</p>

      <h1>How the Guardian reported 2025, with editor-in-chief Katharine Viner</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Katharine Viner</strong>, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells <strong>Annie Kelly</strong> what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.</p>
<p>In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’</p>
<p>It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even more</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>From the Super Bowl to UFC cards to the US Open to the Ryder Cup, the US president has turned sport into his own personal stage. There’s more to come</p>
<p>Considering he’s the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/donald-trump-hard-work">self-declared hardest working</a> president to ever hold the office, Donald Trump has spent a remarkable amount of the past year away from it. In 2025, he loomed over sports like no American politician before him, his visits to stadiums and arenas and golf courses and race tracks so frequent they began to feel like part of the job description. But if Trump’s presence on the sporting scene has seemed hard to escape, gird yourselves for 2026, when the American presidency no longer merely intersects with sport but threatens to subsume it. The World Cup is on the way, the Olympics are right behind it, a UFC card is coming to the White House lawn (not a joke) and the commander-in-chief’s well-documented fondness for jumbotrons is becoming less of a habit than a dependency.</p>
<p>Trump’s grand tour sportif began less than three weeks after his second inauguration, when he become the first sitting president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/08/super-bowl-trump-end-racism-politics">to attend the Super Bowl</a>. One week later he was at the Daytona 500, where Air Force One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FMzOKEKA4to">buzzed the speedway on arrival</a> before his armored limousine, “The Beast”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMNHoprgcAw">paced the field</a> for a couple of ceremonial laps.</p>

      <h1>Alex Sarama: how a 30-year-old Englishman became an WNBA head coach</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Portland Fire are set for their debut season in the WNBA. Their coach has completed an unlikely journey to the top of his sport</p>
<p>As an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved. For the British-born Sarama, who on 28 October was named the head coach of the WNBA’s newest expansion team, the Portland Fire, people doubted him before he even put two sentences together.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died. The inspector general report, released Tuesday, suggests that a new mandate in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill could help reduce these kind of payments. The bill requires states to audit Medicaid beneficiary lists against the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File. Privacy laws currently restrict access to this file. The report recommends states comply with the new mandate to conduct quarterly death checks to prevent further improper payments.</p>

      <h1>U.S. GDP sees healthy growth</h1>

<p>The ban follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VAto counsel veterans and their families about abortion, as well as offer the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy imperiled their health. In August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals">the administration filed paperwork</a> to officially roll back the policy, which had helped the VA’s network of 1,300-plus healthcare facilities – which treat nearly 10 million veterans each year – expand access to abortion, especially in the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade.</p>

<p>A drag queen Christmas tour has become an annual holiday tradition in Florida – and in recent years, so has the ensuing backlash.</p>
<p>Now in its 11th year, A Drag Queen Christmas, featuring performers from RuPaul’s Drag Race, will stop in the Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola on Tuesday night, despite state officials’ best efforts to cancel the show for what they claim is an “anti-Christian” performance at a city-owned theater.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump</p>
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.</p>
<p>The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.</p>
<p>Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.</p>
<p>Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests">Multiple references to Donald Trump</a>, including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Files featuring redactions that were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media">found to be removable</a> through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>A little over a week ago, Disney became the first major media company to strike a content licensing deal with Sora, OpenAI's short-form video platform. This means that people on Sora can start making videos with Disney characters. Today, we'll chat about what it means for consumers, the companies, and artists in the entertainment industry. But first: GDP growth jumped in the third quarter, and it was not just consumers buying stuff.</p>

      <h1>‘Haunted and cursed’: Lake Lanier has a deadly reputation. A darker tale hides beneath the surface</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>After years of fatalities and bizarre incidents, the Georgia reservoir has spawned countless ghost stories. Are they merely legend or the aftereffects of a history steeped in racial trauma?</p>
<p>Kile Glover was the entertainer in the family, the pride of his stepfather, the R&amp;B superstar Usher. He sang, he danced – he burned CDs of his own music, styled the covers with self-made art and was otherwise expressing his creativity in internet videos before it was trendy. “He would’ve been a YouTube sensation by now,” says his mother, the celebrity stylist Tameka Foster. But that future was thwarted on a family trip to Lake Lanier, just outside his Atlanta home town, in July 2012.</p>
<p>Kile was only 11 when he was struck by a speeding jetski while tubing and knocked unconscious. Foster, on the island of Saint Martin at the time, managed to get to Kile’s hospital bedside within hours thanks to Usher sending a private plane – an olive branch that came amid a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tameka-raymond-ushers-status-helped-win-custody/story?id=19969051">bitterly public</a> custody battle over their two younger sons. As Kile lay on life support, Foster passed the time Googling for information about Lake Lanier. She is still horrified by what she learned.</p>

      <h1>A new era for weight-loss drugs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>GLP-1 weight-loss drug injections have slimmed many waistlines and wallets. U.S. regulators have now approved a much less expensive alternative; Novo Nordisk has gotten the green light for an oral version of Wegovy. Pills are cheaper to manufacture than injectables, and that could be a game-changer. Then, consumers still feel pessimistic heading into the new year, and more Americans are staying unemployed for longer.</p>

Plus, &quot;oshikatsu&quot; is a Japanese term referring to fervent fan subcultures surrounding things like sports teams, pop stars, or anime — and it's helped pull Japanese retail sales out of a slump.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The number of people in immigration detention in the US has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration">hit an all-time high</a>, according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p><strong>What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?</strong> In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">no criminal record</a> continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)</p>
<p><strong>How are ordinary people fighting back?</strong> As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back">Julia Carrie Wong reports</a> on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.</p>
<p><strong>What did Trump say about Clinton?</strong> “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?</strong> The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action">a resolution</a> directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>By representing its region’s distinct culture and players, the Canadian Premier League team aims to boost the province’s undoubted soccer potential</p>
<p>Boulevard Saint-Laurent is one of Montréal’s great arteries, a throughway for gourmands coveting smoked meat sandwiches or proper pizza at one of a dozen different joints in Little Italy. It’s also home to Evangelista Sports, a shop that has doubled as a shrine to the city’s soccer-obsessed for more than 40 years and is every bit a part of Montréal’s cultural fabric as poutine or lamenting the cold.</p>
<p>It’s also where FC Supra du Québec opted to announce their first-ever signings last week. The Canadian Premier League (CPL) expansion team is looking to become part of the city and province’s cultural identity, hoping their commitment to recruiting a full roster of Québec-born or raised players, inspired by European clubs like Athletic Bilbao, will go a long way in helping to build a pathway which has so often seen talent slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>Warriors forward Draymond Green had a heated exchange with his head coach, Steve Kerr, in a third-quarter huddle during Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic before leaving the court and heading to the locker room to calm down.</p>
<p>“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”</p>

      <p>Gold surpassed $4,400-per-ounce for the first time Monday. Prices are up 60% in 2025. In the same year, the value of the U.S. dollar slipped 9%. What gives?

<p>Images of the boxes, which resemble tiny padded cells, first spread on social media last week, after a <a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/12/16/social-media-posts-about-wooden-box-mohawk-school-prompts-police-investigation/">former member of the Salmon River school district school board</a> accused officials of building them to seclude children with disabilities.

      <p>Hey Smarties! We’re dropping into your feeds today to share this special coverage from Marketplace.</p>
<p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants.

<p>CBS News was dealing with internal and external uproar on Monday after it pulled at the last minute an investigation for its flagship 60 Minutes show into the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2025/mar/20/cecot-el-salvador-venezuela-prison-trump-deportations">harsh prison in El Salvador</a> where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans from the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The episode about the Cecot mega-prison was due to air on Sunday night. However, in an “editor’s note” <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/2002854497685582309">posted on X</a> late that afternoon, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”</p>

      <h1>Wolves’ freefall leaves even Derby’s dismal record low a lofty goal</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seen</p>
<p>Saturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a Premier League season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.</p>
<p>How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.</p>

      <p>Tenures end for mission chiefs in at least 29 countries, including 15 in Africa, as US reshapes its diplomatic posture</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the US diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s “America first” priorities.</p>
<p>The chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two state department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.</p>

      <p>Interior department move affects five projects under construction in latest blow to industry targeted by Trump</p>
<p>The Trump administration has said it is immediately pausing all leases for offshore wind farms already under construction, in the heaviest blow yet to an industry that the administration has relentlessly targeted throughout the year.</p>
<p>Trump’s Department of the Interior said that it was halting the building of five wind projects due to “national security risks”. The department said it would work with the US Department of Defense to mitigate the risk of the wind turbine towers creating radar interference called “clutter” that could in some way hamper the US military.</p>

      <p>Video shared by the US Geological Survey on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone national park. Other recent eruptions have mostly been audible but not visible because they happened either at night or when the camera was obscured by ice. The agency said the Black Diamond Pool was previously the site of a hydrothermal explosion, in July 2024, that sent rocks and mud flying hundreds of feet into the air and damaged a boardwalk. It prompted the closure of the area to visitors due to the damage and potential for additional hazardous activity</p>

<p>Seven weeks ago, the Jaguars were still <em>that</em> team: loose, entertaining, unreliable. The kind that could light up a quarter and then spend the next three undoing it. Now, they’re a wagon.</p>
<p>After beating the Broncos on Sunday, the Jaguars have ripped off six straight wins. They’ve won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 2007. And with two winnable games to close the season, they have a solid path to the No 1 seed, with the AFC potentially running through Jacksonville.</p>

      <p>Medetomidine has extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms – and the detox centers that help patients are struggling with how best to cope</p>
<p>The staff at harm reduction hub Sunshine House in the middle of Kensington, a neighborhood in north-east Philadelphia home to the most notorious open drug scene in the US, often reverse at least one overdose per day.</p>
<p>But the mutating illegal drug supply is regularly conjuring new drugs with novel sets of potentially deadly risks. For the past 18 months, there has been a new drug in circulation, the veterinary sedative medetomidine, also known as “rhino tranq”. It has perhaps the most extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms of all known street drugs.</p>

      <p>The holiday travel period is upon us. AAA expects 122 million people will drive or fly somewhere to celebrate. Now, we have some good news and some bad news: For drivers, lower gas prices mean a cheaper holiday season. But other travel-related expenses, like car rentals, hotel stays, and flights, are pricier. Then, Jim Beam is pausing production at a Kentucky facility, and more consumers are utilizing AI to help with holiday shopping.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files">casts fresh light</a> on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.</p>
<p><strong>The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law – can Congress do anything?</strong> Lawmakers threatening legal action face major obstacle: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/epstein-files-doj-congress">those with legal power in this case are the ones accused of failing to follow the law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Cecot being investigated?</strong> In March, the Trump administration struck a deal with El Salvador to send to Cecot more than 250 Venezuelan migrants that it accused of terrorism and gang membership. Horror stories have since emerged about abuse that they are alleged to have endured, with lawyers for some of the men who were later released describing the conditions as “state-sanctioned torture”.</p>

<p>Out of 17 sports that proposed an extra discipline to the International Olympic Committee, rowing came out on top with its beach sprints format added to the LA 2028 programme. While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.</p>

<p>Corruption is a word that’s come up throughout this year in relation to U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. There have been allegations of personal enrichment, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, through his family’s crypto and real estate ventures. There are also accusations of quid pro quo deals with foreign leaders and convicted criminals seeking pardons.
Is this a bug in Trump’s administration, or a feature?
To put it all into focus, Tommy Vietor is here. He’s been following this issue of corruption on his very popular podcast, Pod Save America. He also co-hosts Pod Save the World.

<p>The US justice department said on Sunday it had restored an image it had removed a day earlier from the public release of investigative files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> after concluding that the photograph, which included within it a photo of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, posed no risk of public exposure to victims of the late convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>The justice department said the image had been flagged by federal prosecutors in New York for potentially exposing victims of Epstein. Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-epstein-friendship">former friend</a> of Epstein.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s Presidential Pardon Power Is Out of Control</h1>

(date: 2025-12-21)

<p>Several attorneys told the Guardian that those making the legal threats do have tools with which to try to follow through. But there’s a major obstacle: those with legal authority in this case are the ones accused of failing to follow the law.</p>

      <p>As Congress cuts healthcare access to pay for tax cuts and poor Americans die earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageing</p>

<p>Caleb Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore in overtime, and the Chicago Bears overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter Saturday night for a 22-16 win over the Green Bay Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love to a concussion.</p>
<p>The Bears (11-4) extended their lead in the NFC North to one and a half games over the Packers (9-5-1) with two left to play and got some payback for a loss at Lambeau Field two weeks earlier. It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.</p>

</ul>
<p>A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.</p>
<p>Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.</p>
<p>Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”</p>
<p>The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.</p>

      <p>Republicans such as Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene slam redactions, but others express satisfaction</p>
<p>Conservative reaction to the partial release of documents in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> case has been mixed, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> supporters highlighting the prominent presence of Bill Clinton and other Democrats in photographs, with others lamenting how the heavy redaction casts Donald Trump and Republicans in a bad light.</p>
<p>Administration officials defended the redactions with fervent hyperbole. “Never in American history has a President or the Department of Justice been this transparent with the American people about such a sensitive law enforcement matter,” said Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who released <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims">a six-page letter describing the redaction process</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-12-20)
      <p>
      <p>The Golden State’s clean energy use hit new highs in 2025. As the Trump administration abandons US climate initiatives, can California fill the void?</p>
<p>As officials from around the world met in Brazil for the Cop30 climate summit last month, the US president was nowhere to be found, nor were any members of his cabinet. Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>.</p>
<p>During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/11/gavin-newsom-trump-cop30">invasive species</a>” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.</p>

<p>It’s the busiest shopping season of the year – and a time when many are trying to figure out where to ethically spend their money.</p>
<p>Over the first year of Trump’s second term, companies and institutions have fallen in line with the administration’s anti-DEI and anti-immigration policies. As a result, people are supporting economic boycotts to show their discontent with the businesses capitulating to the president.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department was hit with legal threats and scathing outrage after authorities released a limited, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department">heavily redacted trove</a> of Jeffrey Epstein files in an apparent violation of the law mandating the near-complete disclosure of these documents by Friday.</p>
<p>“The justice department’s document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie and my Epstein Transparency Act,” Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December, said in <a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/2002150152690348438">a video statement</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Defense department will still allow stabbing and burning, and ‘weapon wounding’ on animals to test weapons</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> will stop its practice of shooting pigs and goats to help prepare medics for treating wounded troops in a combat zone, ending an exercise made obsolete by simulators that mimic battlefield injuries.</p>
<p>The prohibition on “live fire” training that includes animals is part of this year’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/defense-bill-boat-strikes-hegseth-a0886906eb50432c38a4d5bf08e6a719">annual defense bill</a>, although other uses of animals for wartime training will continue. The ban was championed by Vern Buchanan, a Republican congressman from Florida who often focuses on animal rights issues.</p>

<p>Lindsey Vonn’s expectations have shifted so dramatically during her Olympic comeback that even a podium finish now comes with a sense of frustration.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old American finished third in Saturday’s women’s World Cup downhill at Val d’Isère, France, extending a blistering start to the season that has already included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41">a victory</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/13/lindsey-vonn-second-emma-aicher-world-cup-downhill-st-moritz">a runner-up finish</a> in the space of nine days. But after a small mistake on the lower section of the course cost her valuable time, Vonn left the finish area convinced she had let a potential win slip away.</p>

      <p>Anthony Joshua has said he wants to take on Tyson Fury next, after knocking Jake Paul out in the sixth round of their fight in Miami on Friday night. Joshua dropped Paul four times in the one-sided affair, and then called out Fury – even impersonating his fellow British heavyweight as he urged him to 'sign the contract'. On YouTuber turned boxer Paul, who went to hospital with a broken jaw, Joshua said: 'Jake has spirit, he has some heart. He tried his best and I take my hat off to him.'</p>

Afterwards, the former two-time unified champion was blunt in his assessment of his performance and what should come next.</p>

<p>The Fron2 instrument is featured heavily on the soundtrack for an international feature film called Resurrection by acclaimed Chinese filmmaker Bi Gan. The soundtrack was put together by the French electronic rock group M83 after Joe Berry, one of its members, became captivated by the unique instrument, which is made up of strings held between two wheels, played with a bow.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice on Friday released a long-awaited and huge tranche of documents detailing its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major development in the lengthy saga that turned into one of the biggest political setbacks Donald Trump has suffered since his re-election last year.</p>
<p>While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice on Friday released some long-awaited files related to the convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, but did not release everything in its possession as required by a law Congress passed last month. The partial release drew swift rebukes from Capitol Hill and threats of legal action.</p>
<p>Speaking in an <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/2002002424739864985">interview</a> on Fox News on Friday morning, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein”.</p>

<p>Thirty members of Congress are demanding answers from Dollar General and Family Dollar, requesting internal documents about widespread disparities between shelf prices and register prices at the dollar-store chains’ 28,000 US stores.</p>
<p>The demand for answers – detailed in a <a href="https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/budzinski.house.gov/uploads/2025/12/Letter-to-Dollar-General-and-Family-Dollar-re_-Price-Transparency-12-19-2025.pdf">letter</a> sent on Friday to the CEOs of both companies – comes as the direct result of a 3 December Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/customers-pay-more-rising-dollar-store-costs">investigation</a> of the two national chains. The investigation found that Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span.</p>

<p>Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.</p>
<p>The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: sepia-toned Bears v Packers rivalry takes center stage</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Chicago can edge closer to sealing the NFC North in a sepia-toned Soldier Field showdown that headlines a pivotal week in the NFL playoff race</p>
<p>Another week as the NFL winds up for the postseason offers a fresh look at contenders building for the Super Bowl. Jacksonville v Denver, yes please. Baltimore v New England, bingo. Pittsburgh v Detroit, hmm … OK. Still not satisfied? The strange lights of Saturday night over in the NFC North should do the trick with a sepia-toned showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. A win for either and a Detroit defeat confirms a playoff slot while victory for the Bears gets them close to sealing the division (even in defeat the Packers still will be ahead for the seventh seed). The gaping hole left by Micah Parsons in Green Bay’s defensive front may have Chicago fans edging to the side of expectation that their Bears can put together a deep playoff run if home-field advantage is on their side.</p>

      <p>EPA proposed undoing Biden-era policy on exposure to carcinogenic toxin in latest push to weaken toxin standards</p>

If successful, people would continue to be exposed to concerning amounts of the toxin in thousands of everyday products used across the economy, experts and advocates say.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde, a pungent colorless gas at room temperature, is found in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, home cleaners, craft supplies, leather goods, furniture, clothing, plastic, building materials and other everyday goods. During <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s term, EPA scientists took a major step toward reining in the broad societal risk by issuing a finding that any level of exposure to formaldehyde can cause cancer, and very low levels cause non-cancer health harms.</p>

      <h1>Data centers and your electric bill</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Electricity prices are up 6.9% year over year — much higher than overall inflation — and costs are expected to go up even more in the future. So, how are energy-hungry data centers, used to power AI, crypto, and more, impacting electric bills? That's a question that several Senate Democrats had, who opened an investigation into tech firms this week. Also on the show: TikTok ownership and real estate agents' thoughts on the market.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A man suspected of killing two people and wounding nine others at Brown University before going on to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/suspect-brown-university-shooting">has been found dead</a> in a New Hampshire storage facility, where he had rented a unit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How has the White House responded to the</strong> <strong>incident?</strong> The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has ordered the suspension of the green card lottery program at Donald Trump’s direction, saying it had enabled the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to enter the US.</p>
<p><strong>What did Volodymyr Zelenskyy say about the deal?</strong> The Ukrainian president wrote on social media that the deal “is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.”</p>

      <p>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience</p>
<p>When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.</p>
<p>In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.</p>

      <p>The former Liverpool winger speaks about his hot start at Bayern, playing with Harry Kane, and hopes for the 2026 World Cup</p>
<p>After leaving Liverpool this past summer, Luis Díaz has had a strong start at Bayern Munich under Vincent Kompany, having accumulated 18 goal contributions (12 goals, six assists) in all competitions. Bayern manager Vincent Kompany gave Díaz a few days off to press the reset button after his sending off against PSG, but now the 28-year-old winger is back and ready to wrap up the year as Bayern play their final game of 2025 this Sunday when they travel to Heidenheim. I spoke to the Colombian star about his new club, life in Germany and next summer’s World Cup, which includes a headline matchup against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.</p>

      <h1>Bytes: Week in Review - Micron's big earnings, Oracle's data center woes and "slop" is Merriam-Webster's word of the year</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Building artificial intelligence tools requires a lot of graphic processing units, and those GPUs need huge amounts of ultra-fast memory to feed them data. Micron Technology is one of a handful of memory chip makers that has been selling a whole lot of memory, thanks to the AI boom.</p>
<p>Plus, cloud company Oracle's data center debt is coming under scrutiny. And Merriam-Webster names the word of the year for 2025: slop.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, to learn more on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

<p>The province has revoked Pacific Link College's certification — just weeks after students came forward to CBC News alleging the school required them to participate in a political campaign for course credit. Advocates estimate hundreds of students were affected by the closure, putting their visa status in jeopardy.</p>

<p>Sam Darnold connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown in overtime, then hit a wide-open Eric Saubert for the winning two-point conversion, and the Seattle Seahawks rallied from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit to stun the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 on Thursday night and take a one-game lead in the NFC West.</p>
<p>“It was something we talked about throughout the season and particularly for this game because of the playoff situation,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said. “You know, you play for the tie and lock up a playoff seat, but I just felt great about our play and I trusted our guys.”</p>

And data collection began late thanks to the shutdown, right in the middle of retailers’ Black Friday sales. In this episode, key caveats to the November CPI.

      <h1>Consumers' collective feeling about the economy isn't matching our spending behavior</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)

<p>Authorities said Thursday that they’re looking into a connection between last weekend’s mass shooting at Brown University and one two days later near Boston that killed a professor at another elite school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>That is according to three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss an investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the people said investigators had identified a person of interest in the shootings and were actively seeking that individual.</p>

      <h1>Deadline nears for release of Epstein files – what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department must release most documents by Friday, and failure to do so would provoke a firestorm</p>
<p>In less than 48 hours, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release most of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">files</a> related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in its possession. Last month, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi">subsequently pledged</a> to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.</p>

      <p>Brooks, who dismissed Epstein scandal as ‘stupid story’, wrote column expressing lack of interest in developments</p>
<p>The New York Times columnist David Brooks appeared in multiple photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein that were released on Thursday by the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p>
<p>The photos, which have been rolled out in batches by the minority Democrats in the committee, lack crucial context, including dates and locations. But the photos appear to show Brooks attending a lunch or dinner event. Brooks is shown seated next to Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US on Thursday, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”, a term used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
<p>As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>Over what the magazine said was 11 separate interviews by reporter Chris Whipple, Susie Wiles spoke candidly about her colleagues, describing Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, JD Vance, the vice-president, as being a “conspiracy theorist for a decade” and Russell Vought, the budget chief, as a “right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>

      <h1>Can we fix America’s long-term care system?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Long-term care is <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/08b8b7825f7bc12d2c79261fd7641c88/ltss-risks-financing-2022.pdf">expensive</a> in the United States. With Medicaid spending cuts looming and the Trump administration’s deportation plans <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/trumps-deportation-plans-threaten-400000-direct-care-jobs-older-adults-and-people-with-disabilities-could-lose-vital-in-home-support/">threatening</a> the caregiving workforce, the system is under even more pressure. On today’s show, Allison Hoffman, health law expert at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School, joins Kimberly to unpack why the caregiving industry suffers from chronic labor shortages and how the U.S. could finance long-term care differently to make it more affordable.</p>
<p>Here’s everything we talked about today:</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>First female appointment to a major oil company has faced fierce resistance from climate activists as boss of Woodside</p>
<p>The surprise appointment of BP’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive">third chief executive in a tumultuous five years</a> reflects the embattled fossil fuel producer’s need for profound change. The hiring of Meg O’Neill appears to offer exactly that.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, is the first female head of a major oil company, and the first “outsider” to be hired to a position usually reserved for company veterans. She joins from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside, where she took up her first chief executive role only four years ago.</p>

      <p>In his 19-minute address to the nation last night, President Donald Trump argued that he inherited a mess from former President Biden; the president claimed he'd made historic improvements to the lives of Americans over the past 11 months. Today, we'll dig into the claims — from the accurate, to the misleading, and the wrong. Also on the show: how scammers are using AI-generated ads to trick shoppers.</p>

      <p>DoJ says a group of protesters at an ICE detention center was part of a terror cell; legal experts say it is an effort to crack down on leftwing groups and deter protesters</p>
<p>After the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September, Donald Trump and others pledged a no-holds barred crackdown on leftwing activists.</p>
<p>“We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” Trump said after Kirk’s shooting. Top White House officials, including JD Vance and Stephen Miller, repeatedly publicly vowed that a crackdown was coming. In particular, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">government focused</a> on “Antifa.” short for antifascist, is not an organization but rather an ideology that broadly describes a variety of left-leaning beliefs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men’s World Cup, compared with current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most fans</p>
<p>In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.</p>
<p>An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry">1.6% of sellable tickets</a> for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.</p>

      <p>As the year draws to a close, it's clear that the post-COVID hiring bonanza has ended, and job-hunting has gotten trickier. Experts are predicting next year to be marked by more of the same: a low-hire, low-fire labor market. Plus, the Nasdaq asks the SEC for permission to allow close to 24/7 trading, and a federal appeals court is blocking the firing of most workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

      <h1>European farmers take to the streets</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The European Union says it's close to agreeing a trade deal with the South American economic bloc Mercosur, which represents Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The agreement covers all aspects of trade, but the most controversial area is agriculture. Farmers have been protesting because they fear a glut of cheap imports. Then, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever roadmap for tackling a Europe-wide housing affordability crisis earlier this week. We'll discuss it with the EU's housing Commissioner.</p>

<p>Canadians under 35 missed credit payments at higher rates in the third quarter than they did at the same time last year, and they're seeking debt relief services in higher numbers, as living costs are outpacing wages. The popularity of &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plans could be making the problem worse. CBC's Jenna Benchetrit explains</p>

<p>Venezuela's bitumen-heavy oil is virtually identical to Canada's and the South American country has the largest proven reserves in the world. But Venezuelan oil has essentially disappeared from world markets over the past 20 years. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to invade Venezuela have opened up the prospect that it could one day return, with huge implications for Canada.</p>

      <p>The defensive end’s pursuit of the NFL sack record defies belief, raising questions about what his perpetually rebuilding team should do about it</p>
<p>The NFL sack record is one of those hallowed figures in professional sports. Michael Strahan’s 22.5 lingered for two decades not because pass rushers failed to get better, but because everything has to break just right for someone to reach it. You need volume. You need game scripts. You need offenses chasing points. When TJ Watt finally tied it in 2021, it felt like he had reached the outer limit. The record had been touched, but not broken.</p>
<p>Myles Garrett has spent this season treating that assumption with contempt. Now, he’s a couple of plays away from history.</p>

      <p>Search engines, social media, e-commerce, and mobile games all make money by selling advertising. But making ads work in AI search might not be so straight forward. Perplexity, for instance, reportedly pulled back on plans to integrate ads into their AI search engine. And internal documents showed the company made only $20,000 in ad revenue in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Garrett Johnson, professor of marketing at Boston University to get a sense of why jumping into the ad business is difficult.</p>

      <h1>US government admits negligence in helicopter-plane collision that killed 67</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Official response to lawsuit filed by victims’ relatives admits FAA and army failures played role in Washington DC crash</p>
<p>The US government admitted on Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration and the army played a role in causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/aircraft-crash-ronald-reagan-airport-virginia">the collision in January</a> between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter near the nation’s capital, killing 67 people in the deadliest crash on American soil in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The official response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims’ families said that the government is liable in the crash partly because the air traffic controller violated procedures about when to rely on pilots to maintain visual separation that night. Plus, the filing said, the army helicopter pilots’ “failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid” the airline jet makes the government liable.</p>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The Senate has given final passage to an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs. The legislation is attempting to overhaul how the Pentagon purchases weapons and pressures Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela. The annual National Defense Authorization Act also raises troop pay by 3.8%. However, the legislation includes some pushback on recent moves by the Pentagon. Several Republican senators back Hegseth and his decision not to release the video publicly. Democrats call for part of the video to be released publicly and for every member of Congress to have access to the full footage.</p>

<p>The changes are part of Trump’s broader effort to reshape the White House environment to match his preferences. Along the colonnade, portraits of past presidents now feature expanded text that permanently records Trump’s assessments of their records.</p>

      <p>Senate advances 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which White House says Trump will sign into law</p>
<p>The US Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to advance a $901bn bill setting policy for the Pentagon, sending the big piece of legislation to the White House, which has said Donald Trump will sign it into law.</p>
<p>The fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, is a compromise between separate measures passed earlier this year in the House of Representatives and Senate. It authorizes a record $901bn in annual military spending, with a 4% pay raise for the troops, purchases of military equipment and efforts to boost competitiveness with US archrivals China and Russia.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami re-signs Luis Suárez for 2026 season after winning MLS Cup</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona striker, who turns 39 in January, has been productive but was benched for the tail end of Miami’s title run</p>
<p>Inter Miami have re-signed striker Luis Suárez through the 2026 season, the MLS Cup champions announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The legendary Uruguay international had 17 goals and 17 assists in 50 appearances for the team in 2025. However, Inter Miami became a buzzsaw after Suárez was dropped to the bench by head coach Javier Mascherano. Replaced by Mateo Silvetti after Miami’s 2-1 loss at Nashville SC in Round One, Miami won their next four games and outscored opponents 16-2 in route to the MLS Cup title.</p>

<p>So it appears Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, agrees with many of us: she thinks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/susie-wiles-trump-interview">Donald Trump’s cabinet is bonkers</a>.</p>
<p>From that bombshell Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1">interview</a>, which featured some <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/693b2a465fd632c8d81d318f/master/w_1600,c_limit/202602-portfolio-embed02%20(1).jpg">truly terrifying</a> close-up photos, we learned that Wiles considers JD Vance to have been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade”. She believes Elon Musk to be an “odd, odd duck”. Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, is, in Wiles’ view, “a right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>
<p>“If we’re judging by these numbers, Americans are completely dissatisfied with the way things are happening in this country.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Community members have stepped up with carpools, food deliveries, school patrols and policy advocacy</p>
<p>Before the school bell rang on the morning of 19 November, dozens of parents – mostly dads – huddled outside schools all around Durham, North Carolina. Bleary-eyed from late-night meetings and dinging group chats, they passed out whistles and gloves before dispersing to stand along school perimeters.</p>
<p>The parents had formed ad hoc welcoming committees for students being dropped off for school – and to serve as a united group of watchdogs against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). A week before Thanksgiving, federal immigration agents had descended upon the city as part of a massive statewide campaign that included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/activists-immigration-charlotte-north-carolina">Charlotte</a> and smaller communities. For almost a month, masked agents, often in tactical vests or fatigues and some <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/12/05/ice-agents-once-again-operating-in-north-carolina-activists-say-including-arrests-in-durham/">carrying rifles</a>, patrolled quiet neighborhoods and vibrant shopping centers around North Carolina. ICE <a href="https://www.wunc.org/race-class-communities/2025-12-12/ice-arrests-nc-criminal-record-triangle-customs-border-patrol">doubled its North Carolina arrests</a> in 2025 from the previous year, totaling 3,400 arrests from 20 January through 15 October.</p>

      <h1>How are your wages comparing to inflation?</h1>

But first, holiday season retail sales numbers out yesterday from the Census Bureau were unexpectedly flat.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/trump-orders-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela">ordered “a total and complete” blockade</a> of all oil tankers under sanctions from entering and leaving Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p><strong>What has Trump said?</strong> In a post on social media last night announcing the blockade, Trump alleged Venezuela was using oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes and vowed to escalate the military buildup. “Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the shooting?</strong> A person dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people</a> and wounded nine others at Brown during final exams.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others</p>
<p>A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.</p>
<p>Former prosecutors and legal experts call the Miami-based inquiry, which has issued some two dozen subpoenas so far, a “fishing expedition”. The investigation’s apparent focus is to identify ways to criminally charge ex-FBI and intelligence officials who have already been investigated and effectively exonerated by two special counsels and a Republican-led Senate panel, which mounted exhaustive inquiries into Russia’s efforts to boost Trump in 2016.</p>

      <p>A career in tech was once seen as a safe bet — the jobs were plentiful, the pay was ample. But this year the tech sector had another “meh” year for hiring according to the job site Indeed. Tech jobs have been declining now for several years, but this year, the losses at least seemed to stabilize, according to Indeed's latest Jobs &amp; Hiring Trends Report. Still, job postings in the industry remain well below their pre-pandemic baseline.</p>

<p>Canada's tax agency says it doesn't expect Canadians who hold simple trusts, known as bare trusts, to file required tax forms this coming tax season — but legislative changes currently before the House of Commons means the requirements will likely be there in 2027.</p>

<p>Undocumented youth in Canada say they’re feeling worried and hopeless as they face decades-long processing times for permanent residence under the humanitarian and compassionate pathway. Lawyers fear more children will lose their status in the coming years, forcing them to go underground.</p>

<p>The Australian classification review board has overturned a decision to block Australians seeing footage of the shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media after Elon Musk’s X appealed against the ruling sought by the eSafety commissioner.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/charlie-kirk-murder-suspect-court-appearance">Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University</a> on 10 September, the eSafety commissioner applied to the board to have video of the shooting classified in Australia. The video was ruled to be “refused classification”, which allowed eSafety to serve notices on social media platforms ordering them to geo-block the posts from view for Australia-based users.</p>

<p>Wiles also said she had told <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that his second term was not supposed to be a retribution tour.</p>
<p>“ <strong>We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over</strong>,” she said in an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-2">interview</a> in March.</p>
<p>I mean, people could think <strong>it</strong> <em><strong>does</strong></em> <strong>look vindictive</strong>. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t think he [Trump] wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it</strong>.</p>
<p>Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.</p>

      <p>The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to 4.6% in November, according to the latest BLS jobs report.

<p>Downing Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79x54dprngo">BBC reported</a> on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.</p>
<p>The agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/business/economy/trump-uk-trade-deal-tariffs.html">New York Times first reported</a> British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Van Hollen go after tech firms including Google and Amazon</p>
<p>Three Democratic US senators announced Tuesday that they are investigating whether big tech companies are passing the soaring utility costs of “energy-guzzling” data centers on to ordinary Americans. The trio sent letters to the heads of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta as well as the data center operators CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix asking for greater transparency, cost-sharing and accountability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut wrote that they were alarmed by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">reports</a> that these data centers caused residential electricity bills to “skyrocket”. Regions with significant data center activity have already endured price increases <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">by as much as 267%</a> over the past five years, the three lawmakers wrote. According to the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency, the average cost of a US family’s electricity bill had risen 7% year-over-year as of September.</p>

<p>Speaking to Vanity Fair, Wiles described Trump – who is teetotal – as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, an insight she ascribed to her relationship with her late father, the broadcaster and NFL star Pat Summerall, who had alcoholism.</p>

      <h1>Democrats condemn Republicans calling for Muslim ban on the heels of Australia shooting</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Randy Fine and Tommy Tuberville, US legislators, face backlash for Islamophobic calls to deport Muslims</p>
<p>Democrats are condemning two Republican members of Congress who said, in the wake of the mass shooting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news">Australia</a>, that the US should ban Muslims from the country and kick out those who already live here.</p>
<p>Congressman Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, said he not only wants deportations of legal immigrants who are Muslim, but “citizenship revocations wherever possible” of Muslims.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>The cost of health insurance is becoming increasingly unaffordable. With many Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidies set to expire, coverage is about to get even more pricier for more than 20 million people next year. These growing costs are fueling interest in a market for cash-only doctors. Today, we'll hear more. But first, all of those government layoffs and employee buyouts have hit the labor market. We’ll discuss.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>From LA to Charlotte, organizers are learning from others’ strategies to protect residents amid federal crackdowns</p>
<p>When Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) set its sights on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> in September, Chicagoans sprang into action to protect their immigrant neighbors: teaching each other how to recognize and safely document ICE agents, setting up “know your rights” trainings, and distributing whistles en masse so people could loudly alert anyone in the vicinity when ICE was spotted.</p>
<p>In the months since, whistles have become a popular raid alert tool in other cities across the country – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New Yorkers</a> wear them around their necks to warn neighbors, the people of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> blast them outside ICE facilities and Charlotte residents used them to ward off Customs and Border Protection officials. While strongly associated with Chicago, the tactic is actually one that city organizers learned in part from groups in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit">suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech</a> he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>On what basis is Trump suing?</strong> He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>
<p><strong>What roadblocks remain to a deal?</strong> The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?</strong> He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.</p>

      <p>The Zen-like US representative from Minnesota has had the highest level of death threats of any congressperson because of the president’s attacks</p>
<p>“That’s Teddy,” said Tim Mynett, husband of the US representative Ilhan Omar, as their five-year-old labrador retriever capered around her office on Capitol Hill. “If you make too much eye contact, he’ll lose it. He’s my best friend – and he’s our security detail these days.”</p>
<p>The couple were sitting on black leather furniture around a coffee table. Apart from a sneezing fit that took her husband by surprise, Omar had an unusual Zen-like calm for someone who receives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMJuCtlxe0M">frequent death threats</a> and is the subject of a vendetta from the most powerful man in the world.</p>

      <h1>Five key moments in the assault on the rights of women and girls in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Since Trump’s second term began in January, global healthcare, especially for sexual and reproductive health, has been under constant attack</p>
<p>This time last year, women’s rights organisations were bracing themselves for a second Trump term. Few were prepared for the chaos that would be unleashed in January. The volume and speed of executive orders coming out of the White House were seen as a deliberate tactic to overwhelm and create panic. In many ways it worked – there was confusion, anger and exhaustion as organisations scrambled to fill the gap left by the USAID freeze. But that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The US administration has been the key driver, supported by intense advocacy work by ultra-conservative groups using the moment to strengthen global ties with political allies.</p>

      <h1>How states are competing in the data center gold rush</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Tech giants are estimated to have spent almost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/tech-ai-spending-company-valuations-7b92104b">$400 billion</a> in capital expenditures this year, mostly to build data centers for artificial intelligence. A single massive facility can have a price tag in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And many states want in on that spending spree. Thirty-seven states have some sort of incentive program to attract data centers with the hope of bringing a boost to their local economies. They're giving away hundreds of millions in tax exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Nicholas Miller, policy associate at NCSL, to learn more.</p>

      <p>Inflation, rising food prices and the high cost of living have been top of mind for consumers all year. But then Olive Garden offers an unlimited pasta meal, or a chain steakhouse restaurant sells a steak dinner with two sides for less than 30 bucks.

      <p>The best we can hope for is that Paul does not get seriously hurt. Joshua, Netflix and the sport itself should know better</p>
<p>Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.</p>

<p>Today, an in-depth look at puberty blockers and their use on minors with gender dysphoria. These drugs have come under an enormous amount of scrutiny in recent years, with some questioning their benefits, safety and long-term impact.
After banning the use of puberty blockers for gender treatment of people under 18, a new clinical trial in the U.K. aims to get to the bottom of those concerns.
Azeen Ghorayshi is a science and gender reporter for the New York Times.
She’ll parse through what we know and don’t know about the effects of blockers in minors, how this became a hugely divisive and politicized debate around the world, and whether this new trial could change our understanding.

<p>More than a gifted student, Aziz was a beloved son, brother, and friend. He had a future filled with promise, and his life was cut short far too soon. His passing has left an immeasurable void in the hearts of his family, friends, classmates, and the broader Uzbek American community.</p>
<p>On behalf of the American Uzbekistan Association, we extend our deepest and most heartfelt condolences to Mukhammad Aziz’s family during this time of unimaginable grief. We stand with them in mourning and are grateful to all who have offered prayers, messages of support, and solidarity.</p>
<p>Mukhammad Aziz will be remembered for his kindness, his potential, and the light he brought into the lives of others. His memory will endure.</p>

      <h1>Providence police release new photos and videos of person of interest in Brown shooting – video</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Video released during a press conference showed an individual dressed in dark clothing before the mass shooting at Brown University. The individual walked alone and they do not appear to be carrying anything in their hands. The individual’s face is concealed and appears to have a light complexion. 'We’re asking for the public’s assistance in … identifying this individual,' said Providence police chief Oscar Perez, urging the public to contact the tipline set up by law enforcement regarding the person responsible for the shooting.</p>

      <p>Company to scrap several electric models and focus on gas and hybrid as US president pulls support for EVs</p>
<p>Ford said on Monday it will take a $19.5bn writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand.</p>
<p>Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an Erev, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Attorneys who eventually quit tell LA Times they were pushed to conclude university system had violated law</p>
<p>Attorneys with the US Department of Justice have reportedly said they felt pressured to accuse the University of California of discriminating against Jewish students and faculty, at the urging of the Trump administration, in what one lawyer described as a “hit job”.</p>
<p>Nine attorneys, some of whom requested anonymity, shared insider accounts with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-13/former-doj-attorneys-university-of-california-ucla-antisemitism-investigation">Los Angeles Times</a> of the federal government’s investigation into California’s research university system. The attorneys said they felt pushed to conclude the UC had violated the law before they had determined the facts. All of the attorneys eventually resigned.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>President’s statement blaming acclaimed director’s death on his dislike of him described as ‘disgusting’ and ‘vile’</p>
<p>Celebrities and lawmakers from both of the US’s major political parties are condemning Donald Trump after the president blamed the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/rob-reiner-obituary">Rob Reiner</a> on what he described as the acclaimed Hollywood director’s dislike of him.</p>
<p>After the apparent killings of Reiner, 78, and his 68-year-old wife, Michele, who were found dead at their home Sunday in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, Trump took to social media to call the director “tortured and struggling”. Trump also claimed Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME”.</p>

      <p>Danny Ceisler’s defeat in sheriff’s race of incumbent who had signed an agreement to work with ICE sends a message on US’s contentious debate around immigration policy</p>
<p>Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.</p>
<p>Party registration in the county is <a href="https://www.buckscounty.gov/186/Voter-Statistics">almost evenly split</a> among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.</p>

<p>The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Law enforcement and public health experts worry that potential cuts to resources that save lives and stop the flow of drugs into the state could raise overdose deaths</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s proposed cuts in federal funding for law enforcement and public health agencies could have a devastating impact on Alaska, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis">which a Guardian analysis found</a> has struggled to curtail overdose deaths even amid a general decline in national overdose fatalities.</p>

      <p>There’s more evidence that China’s economy is stalling. Beijing released a batch of government data today that was not encouraging. Chinese consumers have slammed their wallets shut, and data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China paints a picture of stagnating investment, output, and consumption. And later, we'll preview long-delayed economic data slated to come out this week and learn why retailers are hiring fewer workers for the holiday shopping season.</p>

      <p>Spurs have faced low moments in their history, and this is one of them. How will the club respond in the post-Daniel Levy era?</p>

</ul>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/14/nottingham-forest-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest</a>, are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).</p>
<p>Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">leaves them 11th</a>, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.</p>

      <h1>Brown University shooting: what we know so far about the attack in Providence, Rhode Island</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released</p>
<p>Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p><strong>A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day</strong>. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. <strong>The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A shooter dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University</a> during final exams</strong> on the Ivy League campus.</p>
<p><strong>Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students</strong>. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital</strong>, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.</p>
<p><strong>Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,</strong> praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.</p>
<p><strong>The two slain have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims">identified</a> by loved ones as</strong> <strong>Ella Cook</strong> <strong>, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and</strong> <strong>MukhammadAziz Umurzokov</strong> <strong>, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.</strong> Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.</p>
<p><strong>The university <a href="https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy">announced</a> that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.</strong> A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.</strong> An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.</p>
<p><strong>The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.</strong> Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”</p>
<p><strong>The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department</strong>. According to the university’s website, the building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices. Brown, one of the America’s most prestigious colleges, has roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students.</p>

<p>Scott Yenor, appointed as <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/scott-yenor-phd">Heritage’s new director of the B Kenneth Simon Center for American Studies</a>, has also recently offered ultra-conservative opinions on women, marriage and LGBTQ+ rights in recent podcast appearances and speaking engagements.</p>

      <p>This week, the Senate is set to take up the $900 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed it last week. It is more than 3,000 pages of defense policy planning that the Senate will be digging through; the actual funding of these plans comes later. But there's also a whole lot of stuff that's not defense-related. Today, we'll dig in. Plus, we'll hear how China came to dominate in money laundering.</p>

<p>For example, in January 2017, in response to scrutiny of one of the president’s executive orders, the Department of <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/825864341190750208">Homeland Security (DHS) posted</a>: “We are &amp; will remain in compliance with judicial orders.

<p>LeBron James made two free throws with 3.9 seconds left, Luka Dončić scored 29 points and the Los Angeles Lakers recovered from blowing a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter to top the Phoenix Suns 116-114 on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Phoenix trailed 99-79 with 7:48 left, but took a 114-113 lead with 12.2 seconds left on Dillon Brooks’s three-pointer over James, who made contact with Brooks after the shot. Brooks bumped James on the way back down the court, earning his second technical foul and an ejection.</p>
<p>More importantly, it gave the Lakers a free throw, but James missed the shot. On the ensuing possession, James was fouled on a three-point attempt by Devin Booker with 3.9 seconds left. The 40-year-old James – who finished with 26 points – missed the first free throw but made the final two to give the Lakers a 115-114 lead. Phoenix’s Grayson Allen got up an awkward shot at the buzzer, but it was blocked by James.</p>

</ul>
<p>A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.</p>
<p>The disclosure was made at a hastily convened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&amp;t=908">late night news conference</a> to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”</p>
<p>The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.</p>

      <h1>US librarians tackle ‘manufactured crisis’ of book bans to protect LGBTQ+ rights</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>In at least half a dozen states, librarians have joined forces with civil rights groups to oppose book bans, often facing personal and professional repercussions</p>
<p>For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.</p>
<p>“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”</p>

<p>Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home.

<p>“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Federal funds helped Bogalusa address the deep roots of crime – but with the grant pulled, has momentum been lost for ever?</p>
<p>Before the street outside her mother’s home filled with gunfire, before panicked partygoers sprinted through the front yard, before she discovered that the body on the ground was a young man she had watched grow up, Khlilia Daniels knew something in Bogalusa had to change.</p>
<p>It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place. Murders, once rare, now seemed to be happening almost every month, shootings every other week, and in a city of just over 10,000 people, that violence felt close, the losses personal. The victims and perpetrators were predominantly Black, usually young and too often cousins, neighbors or the children of friends, people whom Daniels would see around, until suddenly they were gone.</p>

<p><strong>Were either known to the authorities?</strong> Naveed Akram was examined by security agencies in October 2019 because of his alleged associations with others, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0">He said</a> the alleged shooters were not thought to be “part of a wider [terrorist] cell”.</p>
<p><strong>Are gun laws being discussed?</strong> Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.</p>

<p>The word &quot;slop&quot; was first used to refer to soft mud in the 1700s, but has since evolved to mean of little value — especially when referring to online content of low quality that's made with artificial intelligence. Runners-up include &quot;touch grass,&quot; &quot;performative&quot; and &quot;6-7.&quot;</p>

      <h1>Philip Rivers: how a 44-year-old grandpa nearly pulled off one of the NFL’s greatest comebacks</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>The Colts quarterback was coaching high school football before his surprise return. And he showed brains are almost important as brawn at his position</p>
<p>Is quarterback <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers-playbooks-nfl-quarterback">the most demanding position in sports</a>? It’s close enough to make no difference: players must memorize a complicated playbook, orchestrate an entire offense, scan for open receivers while 280lb opponents sprint toward them with violent intent, and then thread a pass to a target who could be 30 yards downfield amid a crowd of defenders. Now try doing all that as a 44-year-old grandfather, exactly 1,800 days since you last started an NFL game.</p>
<p>Philip Rivers broke a historic streak for the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. The longest layoff between games before then belonged to another 44-year-old quarterback who returned to action after years out of the game, and some time in coaching – Steve DeBerg for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown University students were told that all remaining classes and exams for the semester would be delayed after the shooting that killed two people and left several others injured.</p>
<p>In a note to students, the university’s provost, <strong>Francis J Doyle III</strong>, said the decision was made “out of our profound concern for all students, faculty and staff on our campus”. He encouraged students and staff to focus on their safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus. Students are free to leave if they are able. Students who remain will have access to on-campus services and support.</p>
<p>At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now. University leaders are committed to providing care and mobilizing resources to assist our community members through this difficult time.</p>

<p>“We almost had a midair collision up here,” the JetBlue pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic control. “They passed directly in our flight path ... They don’t have their transponder turned on, it’s outrageous.”</p>

      <p>End of subsidies after failed legislation will have serious and damaging impact on entire sector, policy experts say</p>
<p>With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.</p>
<p>The average amount ACA plan enrollees pay annually for premiums is estimated to more than double, from an average of <span class="math inline">\(888 this year to \)</span>1,904 in 2026, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">KFF analysis</a>.</p>

      <p>In an economy that rewards confession and self-labeling, pain is no longer something to survive – but something to brand, sell, and curate</p>
<p>In March 2023, Dr Gabor Maté, a retired family physician and among the most respected trauma experts in the world, boldly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/the-trauma-doctor-gabor-mate-on-happiness-hope-and-how-to-heal-our-deepest-wounds">diagnosed</a> Prince Harry with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), during a live interview.</p>

These were not evidence of disease per se, Maté went on to elaborate. Rather, he said: “I see it as a normal response to abnormal stress.”</p>

<p>The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.</p>

      <h1>‘It feels endless’: despite misplaced fanfare about a model home, LA struggles to rebuild</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>As LA’s mayor touted a developer’s model home, residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades wrangle for insurance payouts</p>
<p>Nearly a year after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires">mammoth wildfire</a> tore through Pacific Palisades, leveling 7,000 structures and leaving many displaced, some residents watched as the mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> hailed a “major milestone” in the effort to recover.</p>
<p>A new home had been built, the first since the firestorms that killed at least 12 people in the Pacific Palisades and 19 people in Altadena, and the Los Angeles department of building and safety had issued a certificate saying it had passed inspection and was ready for people to move in.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country's bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.</p>

      <h1>‘It’s not a coincidence’: journalists of color on being laid off amid Trump’s anti-DEI push</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>Black and brown former employees from CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue talk about the effects of being let go</p>
<p>Trey Sherman was traveling to work on the New York subway when he received an email from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/07/bari-weiss-cbs-news-remake/">David Reiter</a>, a CBS News executive, about an imminent meeting on 29 October. Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html">more than 2,000 jobs</a> as part of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.</p>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure</p>
<p>For states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">AI</a>) technology in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.</p>
<p>The Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview">who meet certain application criteria</a>, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.</p>

But as much as the scandal surrounding the former prince now known only as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor garnered headlines, there were other notable moments this year that sent signals about the monarchy and its future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with the pains associated with buying tickets for high-profile events: Face value tickets are expensive — if they’re even available, and tickets often sell out fast, only to pop up on resale sites, where they’re sold for exorbitant prices.

<p>A Native American tribe in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas">Kansas</a> is facing criticism from other tribal groups after its economic development subsidiary secured a $29.9m federal contract from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to design potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> detention facilities.</p>
<p>The development entity of <a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/">the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation</a> signed the contract to design the detention facilities in October, leading to criticism that the tribal group, which was uprooted from the Great Lakes region to reservation lands north of Topeka, Kansas, in the 1830s, was itself benefiting from forced removals under the Trump administration.</p>

<p>An extraordinarily strong system known as an atmospheric river hit the region earlier this week, dropping <a href="https://apnews.com/article/atmospheric-river-pacific-northwest-flooding-warming-9a175150afae172f2ebca27133abbd5b">more than a foot of rain</a> and flooding rivers that stretch across the state toward <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> to dangerous levels. As a result of the nonstop rain, mudslides tore through communities, washing away homes and stranding families on rooftops as they waited for rescue.</p>

      <p>Arabella McCormack, 11, died after being tortured and starved by adoptive family and police and church failed to intervene</p>
<p>A lawsuit over the death of an 11-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> girl who was allegedly tortured and starved by her adoptive family reached a settlement on Friday totaling $31.5m from the city and county of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-diego">San Diego</a> as well as other groups.</p>
<p>The suit was brought on behalf of the two younger sisters of Arabella McCormack, who died in August 2022. The girls were ages six and seven at the time. Their adoptive mother, Leticia McCormack, and McCormack’s parents, Adella and Stanley Tom, are facing charges of murder, conspiracy, child abuse and torture. They pleaded not guilty to all charges, and their criminal case is ongoing.</p>

<p>New Nasa satellite images reveal the scope of central California’s dreary December, caused by an enormous fog formation that has been haunting the Central Valley for weeks, trapping residents in colder-than-usual temperatures.</p>
<p>The low cloud formation, known as tule fog, first formed over central California in November and persisted into early December. The Central Valley typically sees this type of fog during the colder months of the year, when the air near the ground is cold and moist, and the winds are calmer, allowing moisture in the air to transform into a thick layer of fog.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://ticas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DFP-Topline-Polling-Results_12.3.25.pdf">survey</a> found that a whopping 40% of student loan borrowers say that their loans have negatively affected their ability to cover their basic needs, such as food, housing and transportation – a financial burden that becomes even more apparent around the holiday season.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Wild made an all-in move for one of the NHL’s best players in his prime, acquiring defenseman Quinn Hughes from the Vancouver Canucks in a blockbuster trade – their boldest action yet toward ending a decade-long skid of playoff series defeats.</p>
<p>The teams announced the seismic move on Friday night, after the 2024 Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman had been the most talked-about trade candidate over the past couple of weeks. Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.</p>

      <p>
      <p>US president finds himself shouldering same burdens of affordability crisis and the inexorable march of time</p>
<p>He was supposed to be touting the economy but could not resist taking aim at an old foe. “Which is better: Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe?” Donald Trump teased <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/trump-pennsylvania-affordability-speech">supporters in Pennsylvania this week</a>, still toying with nicknames for his predecessor Joe Biden. “Typically, Crooked Joe wins. I’m surprised because to me he’s a sleepy son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.</p>

<p>Robert Pender and Michael Sabel, the <a href="https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/">founders and co-chairs of Venture Global</a>, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) company headquartered in Virginia, bought more than a million shares worth almost $12m each in March.

      <p>Burrowing owls, who boarded cruise ship in Miami, to be returned to US next month after long spell in quarantine</p>
<p>Two burrowing owls stowed away on a cruise ship out of Miami, and are now living the high life at a Spanish resort before returning to the US next month.</p>
<p>Biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said the mating pair boarded Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas before the vessel’s transatlantic crossing to Cartagena in southern Spain in February. The tiny owls, a threatened species in Florida, usually prefer more rural landscapes, and may have been spooked by all the concrete around the Port of Miami, they say.</p>

      <h1>The Trump administration keeps picking fights with pop stars. It’s a no-win situation | Adrian Horton</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-bait</p>
<p>Last week, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.</p>
<p>Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/15/taylor-swift-silence-trump-administration-speaks-volumes">appearing as if you condone</a> the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and Clemens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>With Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still matters</p>
<p>Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball">would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban">explained his specious reasonings behind it</a>, last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.</p>
<p>Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball">died in September 2024</a>, Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.</p>

      <p>The report, based on documents obtained by the New York Times, says it’s unclear how many arrests have been made due to this data sharing</p>
<p>The admiral in charge of US military forces in Latin America will retire two years early, AP reports, amid rising tensions with <strong>Venezuela</strong> that include Wednesday’s seizure of an oil tanker and more than 20 deadly strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats.</p>
<p>Three US officials and two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Admiral <strong>Alvin Holsey</strong> was pushed out by defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>. Two officials said Hegseth had grown frustrated with Southern Command as he sought to flex US military operations and planning in the region.</p>

<p>House Democrats have published a new tranche of what they called “disturbing” photographs from the estate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, featuring among others Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and the British former royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>
<p>The 19 photographs in the initial drop – some of which have been seen before – plus another 70 released later Friday afternoon represent a small number of the almost 100,000 images released to the House oversight committee, which is looking into the conduct and connections of Epstein, the disgraced financier who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest">died by apparent suicide</a> in a New York jail cell in 2019 after he was charged with sex-trafficking offenses.</p>

      <h1>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric</p>
<p>For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “ <a href="https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/">the dependency trap</a>”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Defeat complicates the picture for Republicans across the US as they seek to redraw districts in an increasingly messy battle</p>
<p>The Indiana legislature’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejection</a> of a new map that would have added two Republican seats in Congress marked one of the biggest political defeats for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> so far in his second term and significantly damaged the Republican effort to reconfigure congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The defeat showed that Trump’s political might is not unlimited. For months, the president waged an aggressive effort to twist the arms of Indiana lawmakers into supporting a new congressional map, sending JD Vance to meet in person with lawmakers. Trump allies also set up outside groups to pressure state lawmakers.</p>

      <p>Displays include handcuffed baby Jesus and Mary wearing a gas mask in wake of Trump’s immigration crackdown</p>
<p>Satirical holiday displays mocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s aggressive immigration crackdown, portraying the newborn Jesus and his parents, Mary and Joseph, as victims of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/border-agents-trump-immigration-crackdown">heavy-handed tactics</a> by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>), have appeared across the US.</p>
<p>One striking retelling of the Christmas story, at Lake Street church in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> suburb of Evanston, features baby Jesus lying in a manger in the snow – but wrapped in the kind of thin, foil blankets given out in emergencies and regularly as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/ice-hidden-detention-sites">bedding to ICE detainees</a>, and with his wrists zip-tied.</p>

      <p>Ya’akub Vijandre, held in ICE detention in Georgia, tells Guardian he is concerned for safety of family and friends</p>
<p>Ya’akub Vijandre, a Muslim photojournalist, martial arts teacher and first responder who ICE detained in October for posting on social media, told the Guardian that the government is “attacking my faith” and that he was “concerned about the safety” of his family and friends.</p>
<p>Speaking in his first interview from Georgia’s Folkston detention center, the 38-year-old said guards treat detainees “like animals”, yelling at them when they don’t understand English. One guard responded to his request to use the bathroom during a visit to the detention center’s library by telling him, “just piss on yourself”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>Five years after legalizing psilocybin to treat a raft of health problems, practitioners worry the industry has become too costly, too white, and too regulated. Can the landmark program find its footing?</p>
<p>Jenna Kluwe remembers all the beautiful moments she saw in a converted dental clinic in east Portland.</p>
<p>For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips. She watched elderly clients with terminal illnesses able to enjoy life again. She saw one individual with obsessive compulsive disorder so severe they spent hours washing their hands who could casually eat food that fell on the floor.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration is reconfiguring a government watchdog that grew out of the Great Recession. The Financial Stability Oversight Council watches out for risks to the financial system to prevent the future need for government bailouts. Now, the Treasury Secretary says the watchdog will focus on boosting economic growth and easing regulations that he says impose “undue burdens.&quot; Plus, we follow the money from Machu Picchu and examine the appetite for &quot;extended range&quot; EVs.</p>

      <p>With ICE targeting vendors and fear rising, community groups are organising fast to keep New Yorkers working on the streets safe</p>
<p>On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables. Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of immigration raids across the city.</p>
<p>“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights information.”</p>

      <h1>What the vibe of your office holiday party says your workplace</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year — and with that, the obligatory office holiday party. Thing is, some choices around holiday parties can tell a story of how a company is doing. Who's there? Who's chatting together or sticking to a corner? What food and drink are being served? Today, we'll help you read the room. But first, most regional Federal Reserve bank presidents have been reappointed, despite some Trump administration proposals to exert greater control over the Fed's regional banks.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>Lawyers say people ‘don’t feel safe to leave their home’ as officials target recent arrivals and those awaiting hearings</p>
<p>Immigration agents appear to be increasingly arresting and detaining Afghan asylum seekers, especially men, who have arrived in the US recently and are awaiting court hearings to decide their cases.</p>
<p>Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Indiana Republicans reject effort to redraw voting maps in rebuke to Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>Measure to add two GOP-friendly seats failed 19-31 after 21 Republicans joined 10 Democrats. Plus, how the Paris climate treaty changed the world</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Indiana Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines</a> on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.</p>
<p><strong>How might the administration react to the vote?</strong> Heritage Action, the advocacy branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted on social media: “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”</p>
<p><strong>What are Democrats doing on redistricting?</strong> They’ve retaliated to the initial push by Texas to add five more likely Republican seats by redrawing maps in California.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been pushback to Trump’s escalation?</strong> Yes – after the US seized a tanker named the Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, some US lawmakers expressed concern that Trump was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker">“sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.</a></p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Reddit has filed a lawsuit calling for Australia's social media ban for children under 16 to be declared invalid. The text-based forum is one of 10 online platforms covered by the ban, which came into force this week. And later in the program, we head to Peru, where conflicts are brewing over how money from Machu Picchu tickets is being spent and whether it's benefiting tourists and locals.</p>

      <h1>Trinity Rodman: why US soccer could lose its most compelling star to Europe</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The forward’s blocked contract and a growing talent drain to Europe have nudged the NWSL into crisis mode. Here’s what’s happening and why it matters</p>
<p>The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women’s Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.</p>
<p>Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL’s future. Yet European giants have offered her salaries that America’s top women’s domestic league cannot legally match, prompting the NWSL <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/trinity-rodman-s-multimillion-dollar-contract-rejected-by-nwsl">to veto a record-breaking Washington Spirit deal</a> (and the players’ union <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/12/05/nwslpa-files-grievance-for-trinity-rodman-due-to-leagues-veto-of-spirit-contract-extension/">to file a grievance</a> in response).</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: Patriots and Bills battle in AFC East as Rivers runs it back</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The AFC East rivals face off in a game that could decide their conference’s top seed, while a familiar face may return for the Colts</p>
<p>There is some serious debate that could run over this week’s top-shelf matchup. The Rams, the NFC’s current No 1 seeds, are welcoming the Lions, who claimed top seed in the conference last season. The Denver Broncos, the AFC leaders, host the Green Bay Packers who still have a shot at a first-round bye in the NFC. Either way you go you won’t be disappointed. Only there is a third way: Buffalo v New England. The emphasis is on the bounty that winning brings rather than the perils of defeat on Sunday. The Patriots can wrestle back the AFC’s No 1 seed while Buffalo can give themselves a shot at snatching the AFC East title from New England. Oh, and two MVP candidates in Drake Maye and Josh Allen are running the show. It could be a classic.</p>

      <h1>A Hollywood ending? Inside the final days of LeBron James in Los Angeles</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>A new book explores how an all-time great and a world famous franchise handle the waning of a monumental career</p>
<p>In a book about LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, it’s only fitting that one memorable scene involves a Hollywood star: Will Smith.</p>
<p>Yaron Weitzman’s latest book is titled A <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/736427/a-hollywood-ending-by-yaron-weitzman/9780385550222">Hollywood Ending: The Dreams and Drama of the LeBron Lakers</a>. Suffice to say the plot thickens when Smith goes to the Lakers’ film room to speak to the team in 2022.</p>

      <p>Exclusive: Congress members demand answers after Guardian revealed data to be shared for immigration enforcement</p>
<p>More than 50 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/us-veterans-affairs-database-immigration">the Guardian revealed</a> the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.</p>

<p>Every U.S. president releases a national security strategy document about a year into their term, but few have made as big a splash as Donald Trump's, earlier this month.
The document formally spells out much of what we've come to expect from Trump's approach to foreign policy in his second term: political relationships are transactional, and American interests take priority above all else. The document also takes particular aim at Europe, and pledges explicit support for right-wing movements abroad.
Bob Rae was, until recently, Canada's ambassador to the UN, following decades of political office including premier of Ontario. He reads between the document's lines and explains what it means for Canada — and asks how much of it is actually worth taking seriously.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has exerted more pressure on Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro, expanding sanctions and issuing fresh threats to strike land targets in Venezuela, as the South American dictator accused the US president of ushering in a new “era of criminal naval piracy” in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday, the US imposed curbs on three nephews of Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, as well as six crude oil supertankers and the shipping companies linked to them. The treasury department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0332">alleged</a> the vessels “engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”.</p>

      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell’s latest presser was all about the job market. Buried among the usual talking points, like hiring sentiment and the unemployment rate, was immigration. That’s because the current administration’s immigration policies are complicating Fed measures of labor market health. In this episode, falling immigration turns jobs data on its head. Plus: Robust economic growth comes without typical job creation, U.S.-China trade tensions cool, and one company teaches AI to sort your trash.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Announcement, and lack of details in the weeks following, represents major departure from previous FDA priorities</p>
<p>As the US’s top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines">vaccine</a> officials come under pressure from lawmakers and former leaders, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it will release information “soon” about changes to regulations following unconfirmed claims of deaths after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid</a> vaccination.</p>
<p>It’s part of a sweeping effort, led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/06/vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-change">change</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs">the</a> routine vaccines given in childhood, limiting access to and casting doubt upon safe and effective vaccines.</p>

      <p>It would be absurd to claim the UK has suddenly become a life-sciences leader thanks to the new pricing and tariffs pact</p>
<p>That’s gratitude, eh? It’s not even a fortnight since the government agreed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/01/uk-us-agree-zero-tariff-pharmaceuticals-deal">raise the prices the NHS pays for new medicines</a> and here comes the boss of GSK, Britain’s second largest pharma firm, to extol the virtues of doing business in the US.</p>
<p>The US is “still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/11/us-best-place-for-drugs-companies-invest-boss-gsk">said the chief executive, Emma Walmsley</a>, in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0mmqsf7">a BBC interview</a>, explaining why GSK invests about three times as much over there as it does at home. Alongside China, the US is also “the best market in the world to do business development”.</p>

<p>The Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny over a series of attacks on boats off the Venezuelan coast. At least 87 people have been killed in 22 known strikes since early September. Lucy Hough talks to the Guardian’s deputy head of international news, Devika Bhat</p>

<p>If you want to know what kind of winter to expect across much of Canada this winter, you’re out of luck — Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is predicting above-seasonal temperatures in the eastern Arctic region, but elsewhere, the forecast is pretty up in the air. That’s partly because of climate change and La Niña, experts say.</p>

Those include inflation and Trump's tariffs that are making fertilizer and farm equipment more expensive, and the President's trade war with China which closed a huge market for American soybean exports.</p>

      <h1>Why the Fed cut interest rates</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday. And this decision comes as President Donald Trump continues to put pressure on the supposedly independent agency to move the economy the way he wants. Plus, the president is reportedly beginning final interviews for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s potential successor.</p>

The judge ruled that the federal government never secured a formal order for Ábrego García's removal from the United States.</p>

<p>Football Supporters Europe (FSE), which represents fans across the ­continent, described the prices as “extortionate” and called for an immediate halt to ticket sales after a day when England fans ­discovered that tickets to follow their team through the tournament could cost up to $16,590 (£12,375) in the top categories.</p>

<p>Senior Democratic lawmakers and at least one Republican have condemned Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker</a> off the nation’s coast, with one saying Donald Trump is “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.</p>
<p>There is growing, at least somewhat bipartisan unease in Washington over the administration’s escalating military posture in the region. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.</p>

      <p>Some warn proposal will decimate US tourism industry as free speech advocates say it will lead to people self-censoring</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have accused Donald Trump of “shredding civil liberties” and “censorship pure and simple” after the White House said it planned to require visa applicants from dozens of countries to provide social media, phone and email histories for vetting before being allowed into the US.</p>
<p>In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates again at its meeting this week, partly because Fed officials think the labor market is weaker than it appears. This morning, we'll hear why Fed Chair Jerome Powell says estimating job growth can be so tricky. Also on the show, we'll dig into the drone warfare industry, central to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Plus, are we past tariff inflation yet?</p>

Today, there are people across the country in lockdown again — mixed-status immigrant families, who are experiencing disruptive economic pressures that mirror the pandemic. Today, we'll draw parallels. Plus, more people admit to stealing at self-checkouts. And, what can we expect from the Federal Reserve in 2026?</p>

      <h1>Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns</p>
<p>It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a>’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.</p>
<p>He excelled at <em>two</em> colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/25/shedeur-sanderss-first-round-nfl-draft">dramatic stock crashes</a> in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.</p>

<p>US forces have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong> <strong>, in all this?</strong> The Nobel peace prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway">greeted crowds in Oslo</a> after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.</p>
<p><strong>Do we know who sent the letters?</strong> It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.</p>

      <h1>Mexico raises tariffs on imports from Asia</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Mexico’s parliament has voted in favor of a bill imposing tariffs of between 5% and 50% on more than 1,400 products from Asian nations, including China. Mexico states that the aim is to boost jobs and domestic production. Then, survivors of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim in Britain against the oil and gas giant Shell. And later, we'll hear about the lucrative business of making drones and developing the technology to thwart them.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The AI boom is propelling a once-obscure group of state regulators into key decision-making roles for the economy. AI needs data centers, data centers need power and power is generally regulated in some way — depending on the state — by public utilities commissions.</p>
<p>That's the topic of a new report from the Center on Technology Policy at NYU. Scott Brennen, CTP director and author of the report, said these commissions often make decisions on planning and permitting for new infrastructure and decide the rates utilities charge consumers.</p>

<p>A plan to require supporters travelling to the United States for the World Cup to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/tourists-social-media-trump">disclose information about their social media accounts</a> has been described as “profoundly unacceptable”.</p>
<p>Tourists from 42 countries, including the UK, which use the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) as part of the visa waiver programme would be obliged to provide information about accounts they have held in the last five years in their applications. Previously it had been optional to provide the information.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a> voted 312-112 to pass a sweeping defense policy bill on Wednesday that authorizes $900bn in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">military</a> programs, including a pay raise for troops and an overhaul of how the Department of Defense purchases weapons.</p>
<p>The 3,000-page bill also includes a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/military-strikes-boats-drugs-caribbean-hegseth-congress-93c513e28f38688f5582150c7675c072">demand</a> for more information about nearly two dozen lethal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/visual-guide-us-military-presence-caribbean">boat strikes</a> in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug smugglers.

      <p>
      <p>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May</p>
<p>The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.</p>
<p>The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe">White House national security strategy</a> that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.</p>

      <h1>Fed rate cut diverges from global central bank strategy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter point. That’s pretty much what analysts expected. But in other parts of the world, central banks have been signaling that they plan to hold rates steady or even hike them. In this global economy, why is the U.S. out of step? Also in this episode, we hear the pros and cons of quarterly earnings reports, check in on a union-run pipefitting apprenticeship and dig into why wage growth has slowed.</p>

It may take investigators months to figure out what led to the tragedy, authorities said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/01/stockton-california-shooting-suspect">investigators parse through</a> the aftermath of the shooting, they have found at least 50 shell casings and believe at least five firearms were used in the attack, San Joaquin sheriff Patrick Withrow told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order">groundbreaking legal decision in August 2023</a>, a Montana judge ruled in favor of 16 youth plaintiffs who had accused state officials of violating their constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings in late 2024. But state lawmakers have since violated her ruling, enshrining new laws this year that contradict it, argue 13 of the 16 plaintiffs in a petition filed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>TheFifa prize’s existence was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">announced</a> remarkably soon after the Nobel went to Venezuelan opposition leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-corina-machado">María Corina Machado</a>.

<p>The Colts lost starter Daniel Jones for the season after he tore his achilles on Sunday, while their first-round pick in 2023, Anthony Richardson, is out with a broken orbital bone he suffered in October. With backup Riley Leonard dealing with a knee injury, the Colts turned to the 44-year-old Rivers, who retired at the end of the 2020 season. Rivers, who has been a high school coach since his retirement and <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/philip-rivers-family-tree-kids-grandkid-wife-tiffany-alabama/eb5a2ed147d02cf23380c40d#Philip%20Rivers%20grandchildren">recently welcomed his first grandchild</a>, played for the Colts in his final season after a long stint with the Chargers.</p>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Divisive vote to lower rates highlights uncertainty in the Fed as economy absorbs major shakeups, including tariffs</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it was cutting interest rates by a quarter point for the third time this year, as the embattled central bank appeared split over how best to manage the US economy.</p>
<p>The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.</p>

      <h1>Keir’s performance in PMQs panto sets bar low enough for Kemi to stay as Tory leader | John Crace</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Lib Dems’ Gentleman Ed rips into Starmer for staying silent on The Donald’s US security strategy</p>
<p>With little more than a week to go until the Christmas recess, the Commons is in festive overdrive. Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose of PMQs at the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.</p>
<p>No one embraces the panto spirit more than Kemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.</p>

<p>A US judge on Wednesday morning blocked the deployment by the federal government of national guard troops in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> and ordered the guard returned to the control of the California governor, a court filing showed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is being challenged in federal court over its authority and rationale for continuing to maintain command over the national guard troops it deployed to the city earlier this year.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni moved quickly on Wednesday to shut down the rising speculation around Jalen Hurts’ job security, calling talk of a potential quarterback change “ridiculous” despite his team’s three-game losing streak and their franchise star’s sudden dip in form.</p>
<p>Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl">Monday night’s 22-19 defeat</a> to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.</p>

<p><strong>European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.</strong></p>
<p>Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer <strong>Rheinmetall</strong> are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker <strong>BAE</strong> <strong>System</strong> has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.</p>
<p>Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.</p>
<p>Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.</p>

Several consumer groups designed a shopping experiment with hundreds of volunteers who shopped on Instacart for the same products at the same time from the same stores. The conclusion? 75% of products were offered at different prices to different customers. Plus, we'll chat about what's next for interest rates today and on into the new year. And later, we'll have a conversation about AI with Nobel laureate Peter Howitt.</p>

      <h1>Trump has confirmed Europeans’ worst fears. Are their leaders ready to stand up to him now?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>The White House has formalised its contempt for ‘decaying’ Europe with an ominous plan to undermine the EU and boost the far right</p>

<p>Almost half of EU citizens regard Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/europeans-trump-enemy-of-europe-russia-war-poll">as an enemy of Europe</a>, a new survey across nine countries revealed last week. The poll, conducted for the French debate platform Le Grand Continent, found that across Europe, Trumpism is considered “a hostile force”.</p>
<p>The new US foreign policy doctrine published by the White House on Friday will have heightened these respondents’ worst fears. The 30-page National Security Strategy landed like a bombshell in Europe. And citizens may have been out in front of their political leaders in figuring out what Trump’s worldview could mean for Europeans.</p>

      <p>Today, the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter point. While there's no guarantee of it, the move could translate to lower mortgage rates, too. This presents an opportunity for bad actors to pitch homeowners something that might cost more than they’d think. Today, we discuss some &quot;too good to be true&quot; refinance opportunities.

      <p>
      <p>The FDA is reviewing RSV vaccines, which have drastically lowered infant hospitalizations, a spokesperson confirmed</p>
<p>US regulatory officials are re-examining the safety of RSV shots despite no published reports of safety issues – a move that could lead to the removal or limitation of shots that have dramatically lowered hospitalizations among babies.</p>
<p>It’s the latest move from US health officials under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, to limit access to shots and to undermine public trust in the safe and effective products.</p>

      <h1>Gen-Zine: DIY publications find new life as form of resistance against Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Zines have made a resurgence as communities seek to share information on everything from ICE raids to local elections</p>
<p>On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.</p>

      <h1>Zelenskyy ‘ready for elections’ after Trump questions Ukrainian democracy | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy">ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months</a>, if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.</p>
<p><strong>Why hasn’t there been an election?</strong> Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he talk about?</strong> There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris lost last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">US presidential election</a> because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.</p>
<p>The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by <a href="https://rootsaction.org/">RootsAction</a>.</p>

      <h1>‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressure</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>In 2010 and 2022, the US faced heightened emotions from the lead-in to the tournament itself. As hosts next year, little will change</p>
<p>The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.</p>
<p>With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.</p>

      <p>The extended Black Friday sale season means a lot of people have been buying new TVs. The top sets today can display in up to 8K Ultra High Definition, they have deeper blacks, brighter highlights and are thinner and lighter-weight than ever. And yet, modern TVs have their haters — a dedicated group of purists who find them lacking, and would rather hunt down a good old fashioned used plasma.</p>

<p>European leaders must decide whether to reject or embrace the conclusions of U.S. President Donald Trump’s new security strategy. It berates and insults them and calls into question some of the key premises of collective security that have helped protect the continent for eight decades.</p>

      <p>Memo from Marco Rubio reportedly said cutting Calibri from official communication would ‘abolish yet another wasteful DEIA program’</p>
<p>US diplomats have been ordered to return to using the Times New Roman typeface in official communications, with secretary of state Marco Rubio calling the Biden administration’s decision to adopt Calibri a “wasteful” diversity move, according to an internal department cable seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The department under Rubio’s predecessor Antony Blinken switched to Calibri in 2023, claiming the modern sans-serif typeface was more accessible for people with disabilities because it did not have the decorative angular features and was the default in Microsoft products.</p>
