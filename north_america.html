(date: 2026-01-22)

      <p>The Testimony of Ann Lee is a gorgeous, if often uncomfortable, reminder of the virtues and villainy of blind adherence to spiritual and social norms.</p>

<p>The committee is taking a recess for members to vote on the House floor. A reminder that today we’re expecting a vote on Department of Homeland Security funding bill that dozens of Democrats have vowed to vote against.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, Jamie Raskin, praised Jack Smith’s handling of his investigations into the president. Raskin also noted the persistent denigration by Donald Trump as Smith conducted the probes.</p>

<p>Lindsey Vonn will compete in her fifth Winter Olympics next month after being named to a 97-athlete US Ski &amp; Snowboard roster for the 2026 Milano Cortina Games, a team led by some of the most decorated figures in American winter sports history but also notable for its relative inexperience.</p>
<p>US Ski &amp; Snowboard announced Thursday that it had nominated 97 athletes – 73 skiers and 24 snowboarders – to represent Team USA at the Games, which run from 6–22 February across northern Italy. The team will be officially announced on Monday.</p>

<p>Lemonade has launched what it calls “Autonomous Car Insurance”, a first-of-its-kind product that slashes rates by approximately 50% for Tesla owners when Full Self-Driving is engaged. It’s a bold bet on FSD technology, and it significantly undercuts the discount offered by Tesla’s own insurance product.</p>
<p>It again shows the difference between what Tesla claims and delivers regarding autonomous and assisted driving.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has said an agreement with Nato on Greenland will give the US full and permanent access to the island, as the defence alliance’s secretary general said its members would have to step up their presence in the Arctic.</p>
<p>A day after backing away from his threat to use tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of Denmark, and ruling out the use of force, Trump said on Thursday that the framework deal meant “total access” with “no end, no time limit”.</p>

      <p>There’s no shame in not knowing what he’ll say next: neither does he. But that didn’t stop many claiming to make sense of it</p>
<p>In weeks like this, the mask slips somewhat. Politicians love the illusion of control. It’s the special power that differentiates them from us lower orders. They are the ones pulling all the levers. Nothing ever happens that takes them unawares. They are the ones with answers to everything. They need it to be this way. Not just for their own psyches but for ours. It’s somehow comforting.</p>
<p>And then along comes Donald Trump and our emperors have no clothes. Their limitations on view to everyone. Scrabbling around just to stand still. Trying to make sense of the world in real time, just like the rest of us. Making it up as they go along.</p>

      <p>Jannik Sinner continued his title defence, Naomi Osaka won a tetchy contest and qualifier Nikola Bartunkova shocked Belinda Bencic</p>
<p>Cilic has punched his ticket into round three for the first time since 2022, with the 37-year-old and 2014 US Open champ taking out the 21st seed Shapovalov in straight sets. Decent win, that. He’ll face the winner of Casper Ruud v Jaume Munar.</p>
<p><strong>Stan is still alive!</strong> He’s broken Gea in the final game of the fourth set to snatch it 7-5, finishing off with a vicious backhand winner down the line. It’s got to be one of the most devastating shots in tennis hasn’t it? I don’t think even Federer’s single-handed backhand quite had the equal beauty and brutality that Wawrinka’s does. They’re going to a fifth.</p>

<p>At a former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/cocacola">Coca-Cola</a> bottling plant in downtown <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, Venezuelans Juan Paredes Angulo and his mother, Andreina, five years ago delivered on a decades-long dream to <a href="https://www.visitindy.com/directory/azucar-morena-at-the-garage-at-bottleworks/">open a food stall</a>, sharing regional Venezuelan food with a part of America better used to Tex-Mex and Chinese takeout for international cuisine.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/stacey-abrams">Stacey Abrams</a>, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, will announce on Thursday that the campaign she launched last year to fight authoritarianism in the US has attracted dozens of new partners, representing millions of voters,to form a coalition.</p>
<p>Abrams, a Yale-trained lawyer and former minority leader of the Georgia house, was the first Black woman to win a major party nomination for a gubernatorial race in 2018. After her second loss to Brian Kemp in 2022, she receded from the spotlight, taking a teaching position at Howard University in 2023. In the wake of Donald Trump’s re-election, she launched 10 Steps, an initiative to organize and mobilize opposition to the threat to democracy posed by authoritarian policies in the administration and the Republican party.</p>

      <p>Following the president's intervention in Venezuela, the Trump administration is escalating threats against several sovereign nations. Now, Cuba is set to lose access to one of its main suppliers of oil, adding pressure to its increasing energy shortage and an already struggling economy. This morning, we'll discuss with the BBC's Will Grant. Plus, President Donald Trump’s pivot on Greenland was well-received on Wall Street, and renter affordability is improving.</p>

      <p>Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations when it comes to the US-shaped problem</p>
<p>Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world’s most popular sport finds itself. But the idea is at least seeping into the mainstream and senior figures are asking what, in a worst-case scenario, it would take for football to meet the moment.</p>
<p>Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations. As the Guardian reported this week, an anniversary party for the Hungarian FA on Monday became the forum for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/20/concerned-european-football-chiefs-discuss-response-to-donald-trump-over-greenland">unofficial discussions among national association heads</a> about how a unified approach to the US-shaped problem might take shape.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s announcement of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/trump-greenland-framework-future-deal-reactions">“framework of a future deal”</a> regarding Greenland after weeks of intensifying threats of military intervention has been met with deep scepticism from people in the territory, though it was welcomed by European leaders and boosted markets.</p>
<p><strong>What could a deal involve?</strong> According to media reports, it could result in the US being granted sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland where its military bases are.</p>
<p><strong>Has Denmark agreed?</strong> That remains unclear – but on Wednesday night Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic member of the Danish parliament, said the idea that Nato should have any control over Greenland’s sovereignty or minerals was “completely out of the question”.</p>
<p><strong>What about Trump’s “board of peace”?</strong> At a signing ceremony for the new body in Davos, the US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/trump-board-of-peace-launch-davos">claimed</a> the organisation would be “one of the most consequential bodies ever created in the history of the world”.</p>
<p><strong>What is the family’s situation?</strong> Marc Prokosch, the family’s attorney, said the family had an active asylum case and shared paperwork showing that the father and son arrived to the US at an official crossing point.</p>
<p><strong>Have other children been detained locally?</strong> Yes. Liam is one of four children in the school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents in the last two weeks, the district said. One is age 10 and two are 17.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The world has been reacting to President Donald Trump's announcement of a vague framework agreement over the future of Greenland. The president said that the U.S. will not impose tariffs on eight NATO countries. Then, you might think of corporate bonds as relatively modern, but companies have actually been issuing them since at least the 17th century; so what kind of return can you expect from a bond issued in 1648 by a Dutch water company?</p>

<p>The US has been awarded a new dubious distinction: it has been selected as this year’s focus of an international coalition of legal groups and bar associations as a country where lawyers and judges are so politically intimidated that the rule of law is under threat.</p>
<p>The decision to put the spotlight on the US for Thursday’s “ <a href="https://dayoftheendangeredlawyer.eu/">International Day of the Endangered Lawyer</a>” underlines how rapidly America has plummeted in global esteem.

<p>The Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) program provides a variety of health care benefits for eligible First Nations and Inuit, with dental care accounting for the third largest expense for the program.

<p>New York must redraw its congressional map, a state judge <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-01-21-Order.pdf">ruled on Wednesday</a>, handing Democrats another key opportunity to pick up another US House seat ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The ruling from Jeffrey Pearlman, a New York state supreme court justice, comes after a Democratic-aligned law firm challenged the boundaries of New York’s 11th congressional district, which includes the borough of Staten Island and portions of south Brooklyn. The district is currently represented by Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican, the only GOP member representing New York City in Congress.</p>

<p>House Republicans advanced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/hillary-clinton-contempt-epstein-comer">resolution</a> on Wednesday to hold former president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and former secretary of state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House oversight committee approved the contempt of Congress charges, setting up a potential vote in the House. It was an initial step toward a criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice that, if successful, could send the Clintons to prison in a dispute over compelling them to testify before the House oversight committee.</p>

      <h1>Tesla patents ‘clever math trick’ for HW3, but nothing points to delivering promised self-driving</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-22-at-2.48.22-PM-1-e1555961353311.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1587" alt=""></p>
<p>Tesla has published a new patent that describes a way to squeeze more performance out of its aging HW3 self-driving computers. While the technology is interesting, nothing points to it actually enabling Tesla to deliver on its long-standing promise of unsupervised self-driving on HW3 vehicles.</p>
<p>In 2016, Tesla announced that all vehicles produced thereafter would become capable of “Full Self-Driving” — at one point, CEO Elon Musk even specified “ <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/26/elon-musk-signals-reaching-limit-of-teslas-hw3-despite-self-driving-promise/">level 5 self-driving</a>,” which means capable of driving anywhere, anytime, under any condition.</p>
<p>We are approaching a decade since that promise, and <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/02/tesla-has-no-plan-for-hw3-owners-4-months-after-admitting-it-wont-support-self-driving/">it’s nowhere close to being fulfilled</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, it looks like Tesla is doing everything it can to not fulfill its promise to HW3 owners.</p>

<p>The office of Gavin Newsom, the California governor, said his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos was canceled under pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Newsom had been scheduled to sit down with Fortune at an event sponsored by USA House, the country’s official headquarters at the annual gathering of world and economic leaders. But before the talk was due to begin, his team says, the USA House bowed to political pressure from the Trump administration and denied the governor entry.</p>

<p>But beyond the fractious rhetoric, the US president brought a deeper message on Wednesday that sought to unify the west rather than divide it. It was his most dark, insidious and sinister project of all.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>The president’s fixation on ‘piece of ice’ Greenland carries an echo of Vladimir Putin’s claims about Crimea</p>
<p>The good news headline from Donald Trump’s trip to Davos was that he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/21/davos-2026-trump-greenland-rules-out-force-part-north-america">seemed to rule out force</a> for now in his urgent quest to acquire Greenland. The bad news: he started talking about Iceland as well.</p>
<p>What might have been a big reveal about the next step in Trump’s imperial ambitions was more likely a slip, though all speculation about the workings of the presidential brain is by now a guess at best.</p>

<p>US supreme court justices appeared skeptical of Donald Trump’s case for firing a Federal Reserve governor on Wednesday, in a key test of the president’s power – and his administration’s battle to exert greater control over the US central bank.</p>
<p>Five months after Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/who-is-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-governor">tried to fire</a> Lisa Cook over apparent discrepancies on mortgage applications his officials claim are evidence of fraud, both conservative and liberal justices grilled the administration over whether the US president has the power to fire a Fed governor with seemingly no process.</p>

      <p>US president tells business and political leaders in Davos his country needs ownership to defend ‘unsecured island’</p>
<p>Donald Trump has stepped up his demand to annex Greenland but said the US would not use force to seize it during a rambling, invective-laden speech at Davos where he again lashed out at Europe’s political leaders.</p>
<p>Trump gave his speech as they sought to avert a full-scale crisis over Greenland – an effort that appeared successful later as the US president suddenly announced he would delay imposing tariffs on eight European countries from 1 February as negotiations continue.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>In his second term, Trump’s bluster has been accompanied by an emotional and aggressive approach to foreign policy</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, characterized his approach to international relations as “speak softly and carry a big stick”. It was an approach that won him a Nobel peace prize in 1906, for his role in ending the Russo-Japanese war.</p>
<p>In recent days, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s own take on diplomacy has come into focus, one that might be characterized thusly: speak hysterically and threaten to use (and sometimes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/trump-announces-us-strikes-on-iran-what-we-know-so-far-fordow-israel-nuclear">actually</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/us-politicians-reaction-capture-venezuelan-president-maduro">use</a>) a big stick. This idiosyncratic approach to statecraft has yet to win Trump a Nobel peace prize, although that is something that the president has said – many, many times – does not bother him at all.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>The opportunity for this tournament’s legacy is in the fan fests, camps and tune-ups accessible to more than the lucky few</p>
<p>In Germany, fans watched the games on screens in crowded town squares, their roars careening off ancient buildings, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/11/worldcup2006.sport11">or from the banks of rivers</a>, peering at floating, double-sided big screens on barges. At the next World Cup, in South Africa in 2010, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/12/world-cup-2010-south-africa-fans">people gathered in parks</a> and open-air markets and hotel lobbies and unlicensed, makeshift bars in people’s garages. In Brazil, four years later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/jun/18/world-cup-football-brazil-supporters-in-pictures">fans spilled from the bars on the Copacabana</a> or watched in restaurants or in streets closed for the occasion – not as if anybody was driving during the Seleção’sgames anyway.</p>
<p>During the 2018 World Cup, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/russia-world-cup-2018-saudi-arabia-football-fan-colour-moscow-streets">Russia surprised visitors – and its own citizens</a> – with its friendliness as spontaneous parties broke out all over the country. The reason the 2022 World Cup in Qatar didn’t entirely feel like a real World Cup is that those sorts of spontaneous soccer gatherings just didn’t seem to be happening, or not at the same scale, at any rate. The absence of hordes of supporters just milling about everywhere contributed to the feeling of being at a Potemkin World Cup.</p>

      <p>Reform leader says he agrees ‘strategically’ with Trump but adds that views of Greenlanders must be respected</p>
<p>The world would be a “better, more secure place” if America took over Greenland, Nigel Farage said at Davos, while insisting that he still believed in the sovereignty of nation states.</p>
<p>During a panel at the World Economic Forum’s “America House” in the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday, the Reform UK leader said he had “no doubt” that the world would be safer if a “strong America” was in Greenland “because of the geopolitics of the high north, because of the retreating ice caps and because of the continued expansionism of Russian icebreakers, of Chinese investment”.</p>

<p>Individually and collectively, they have decided “to live in truth” – <a href="https://havelcenter.org/2011/12/31/living-in-truth/">the phrase used by the Czech dissident Vaclav Havel</a> and referenced by the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in his widely praised speech at Davos on Tuesday.

Then, we'll also discuss yesterday's sell-off of stocks and bonds and hear how Russia's war on Ukraine is impacting European airlines’ bottom lines.</p>

<p>Trump vaunted his administration's economic and immigration policies, and took jabs at perceived opponents, former president Joe Biden, U.S. congress member Ilhan Omar — and addressed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney directly, calling him &quot;Mark&quot; and saying Canada &quot;lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Norrie is doing his thing again, upping it when he needs to for another mini-break and 6-2.</strong> I wonder if it’s a cognitive thing, because it’s not like he wasn’t trying his best when struggling earlier in the set, so it’s not an effort thing, but I guess focusing for hours at a time is hard if not impossible and there’s a kind of locked-in version that intensifies as the match does … and, as I type, he serves out to lead Nava 6-1 7-6(3) having saved two set points not that long ago.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously Zverev finds an ace to restore deuce –</strong> he may be resigned to his fate of never winning a slam, but his serve remains one of the best shots in the game, and from there, he ends a long hold. And back with the breaker, Norrie has a mini-break and a 3-2 lead.</p>

      <h1>Claudette Colvin obituary</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>US civil rights activist who as a schoolgirl protested against segregation on Alabama’s buses</p>
<p>Although she was a pivotal figure in the US civil rights movement, Claudette Colvin, who has died aged 86, never received the full recognition she deserved for her courageous and groundbreaking protest against segregation.</p>
<p>On 2 March 1955 Colvin, aged 15, was riding a bus home from school in Montgomery, Alabama, with seats in the front reserved for white passengers, while those in the rear were designated for black people. She was in a “neutral” zone from which, as the bus filled up, the driver could order black passengers to move to the back. When she refused to give up her seat to a white woman, the driver called the police, and Colvin was arrested. Soon afterwards she appeared before a juvenile court. Charges of violating segregation laws and disturbing the peace were eventually dropped on appeal, but her conviction for assaulting a police officer was upheld.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>People around the world are using AI more than Americans, a new poll finds. About 40% of adults in the U.S. told pollsters that they used generative AI in the last year. In Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and India, that number was about 85%. What's driving the divide? But first: a preview of markets before President Donald Trump's speech at Davos, and a look at the struggle between the Trump administration and the Fed.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield has vented his frustrations over the treatment he received from his former head coach Kevin Stefanski, who he will now face twice a year as an opponent.</p>
<p>Mayfield played for Stefanski at the Cleveland Browns before he was traded to the Carolina Panthers in 2022. The two are now major figures in the NFC South after Atlanta hired Stefanski as head coach on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mayfield appeared to be angered after an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter posted that Stefanski said Mayfield and another Browns quarterback, Deshaun Watson, had “failed” in Cleveland.</p>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tech billionaire Elon Musk has picked a fight with Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair; after O'Leary said Ryanair wouldn't be offering Musk's Starlink satellite services, Musk floated the idea of buying Ryanair himself. Plus, Lufthansa — one of the world’s largest airline groups — says that airspace closures due to war zones are forcing substantial rerouting of flights, with the ban on using Russian and Ukrainian airspace creating detours of one to two hours.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Almost 400 millionaires and billionaires from 24 countries are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/21/millionaires-billionaires-taxes-super-rich-mark-ruffalo-wef-davos">calling on global leaders to increase taxes on the super-rich</a> amid growing concern that the wealthiest in society are buying political influence.</p>
<p><strong>What did the letter say?</strong> “A handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth have bought up our democracies; taken over our governments; gagged the freedom of our media; placed a stranglehold on technology and innovation; deepened poverty and social exclusion; and accelerated the breakdown of our planet,” it reads.</p>
<p><strong>What else is happening at Davos?</strong> Trump has top billing at the conference today and is scheduled to give a special address in the early afternoon (2.30pm local time, or 8.30am EST). He was expected to use this speech to outline his affordability agenda, but given his threats against Greenland his address is now expected to take a more international turn.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has landed in Switzerland for the Davos global gathering as Nato’s secretary general said “thoughtful diplomacy” was the only way to deal with growing transatlantic tensions, remarks that came shortly after the US treasury secretary had dismissed Denmark as an irrelevance.</p>
<p>The US president’s threats to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of Denmark, risk tearing the transatlantic alliance apart, while his promise to impose tariffs on European nations who oppose him could trigger a trade war with the EU.</p>

      <p>From firing lawyers and government officials to pursuing indictments – president has created a culture of vengeance</p>
<p>During his first year in the White House, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has pursued a campaign of retribution unlike any other president in US history.</p>
<p>That Trump would pursue such a campaign is not surprising. Since he launched his first run for president in 2015, Trump has channeled the politics of grievance into political success. Returning to the White House after surviving two impeachments and four different criminal cases against him, Trump has used the might of the federal government to punish those he believes have wronged him.</p>

      <h1>‘London is a second home to me’: Steve Nash on the NBA, punditry and non-league football</h1>

(date: 2026-01-21)
      <p>
      <p>We sat down with the basketball legend at the O2 to discuss his ties to Tottenham, Vancouver, Majorca and Macclesfield</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p>
<p><strong>Does your background, growing up outside basketball’s mainstream on Vancouver Island with English parents, help you appreciate how people in places such as London or Berlin feel when a big NBA game comes to town?</strong> Yeah. That’s true. I didn’t watch much basketball on TV until I started playing at 13, so can relate to coming upon something new and exciting. At the same time, the world’s so small now with social media access. But it is interesting to go to parts of the world where basketball is smaller and see how can we make the game accessible to them.</p>
<p><strong>Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and John Amaechi were guests at the O2. But every team had a foreign player on opening night this season, with 135 players from 43 countries across the league; up from 7% in 1992 to 24% now. Are the current Europeans different to that generation or have they just had more opportunities?</strong> Europeans have always been quite good. It’s not like Serbia wasn’t always great at basketball but, as the game has grown, the possibilities grow. The world gets smaller with the internet and social media. There’s not as much difference; everyone has access to all the pertinent information. The NBA is more accessible nowadays to people from Europe, Africa and every corner of the world. It’s only natural that more Europeans have success in the NBA.</p>

In this episode, as some countries no longer see the U.S. as a reliable trade partner, will the global economy leave America behind?

<p><strong>And Davos looks like the place to be this week,</strong> with Trump now declaring that <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925766187001811">after his call with Nato’s Rutte</a> he <strong>will have “a meeting of the various parties” on Greenland</strong> – whatever that means and whoever is going to be involved.</p>
<p>Separately, <strong>it’s not clear if <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925848634299232">Macron’s offer of setting up a G7 meeting on the sidelines</a> was accepted</strong> (although looking at timings it would risk clashing with the emergency EU summit on Thursday night), but his separate invitation to a dinner at the Élysée Palace might be gone after Trump’s <em>very</em> pointed and personal criticism of the French president.</p>
<p><strong>Attacked the UK, mockingly calling it a “brilliant” ally, for “shocking” plan to hand over sovereignity of the Chagos islands to Mauritius</strong> (despite previous US support), saying it’s among a “long line” of reasons why Greenland “has to be acquired”</p>
<p><strong>Leaked private text messages from France’s Emmanuel Macron and Nato’s Mark Rutte</strong> discussing his latest policy moves</p>
<p><strong>Threatened France with 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne</strong> over Macron’s refusal to join the Gaza “board of peace”, <strong>said of Macron that “nobody wants him because he’s going to be out of office very soon”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reiterated his intention of taking over Greenland</strong> as “imperative for national and world security,” saying “there can be no going back”</p>
<p><strong>Posted an AI generated visual of himself planting the US flag on Greenland,</strong> saying it’s “US territory, est. 2026,” days after the US delegation agreed with Danish foreign minister for talks to be conducted behind closed doors, and not through threatening messages on social media.</p>

<p>Tesla is once again telling customers that the window to transfer their Full Self-Driving (FSD) package to a new vehicle is closing at the end of the quarter. While the automaker is framing this as the “last” chance, the history of this program suggests it is being used more as a quarterly demand lever than a hard deadline.</p>

<p>Two experimental payphones – one placed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> and the other in Abilene, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> – are connecting strangers across party lines, allowing callers to speak directly with Democrats and Republicans in two of the US’s most ideologically opposed cities.</p>
<p>The project is the work of Matter Neuroscience, a Boulder, Colorado-based biotech company and is fashioned out of old payphones bought off Facebook. One phone sits outside Black Serum Tattoo parlor in San Francisco’s Mission District – and the other is in downtown Abilene by the bookstore Seven and One Books. Each phone is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTjPMBUjhKS/">marked with a sign</a> explaining that callers will be connected to someone from the opposite end of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>European football leaders are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump’s wish to annex Greenland, and they have held initial discussions about how the sport could respond.</p>
<p>The Guardian understands the implications for the World Cup this summer were among the topics raised among about 20 football association heads in Budapest on Monday. Talks about the Greenland crisis were held informally on the sidelines of an event organised to celebrate the Hungarian football federation’s 125th anniversary, in the knowledge that a unified European response may be required should Trump seek to escalate the situation.</p>

      <p>Court considering legality of state law banning guns on private property open to the public unless owner allows it</p>
<p>The conservative majority on the US supreme court appeared skeptical of a Hawaii law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public without permission from the property owner.</p>
<p>The case, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dd86e0364a67a0989dfb915/t/649cae66d93727777ff10ab8/1687989862759/23.06.28+Complaint.pdf">Wolford v Lopez</a>, was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group who have support from Donald Trump’s administration.</p>

<p>Genesis designers crafted a luxury electric pickup to go head-to-head with the Tesla Cybertruck, but those plans were later shelved. New images reveal the EV pickup was nearly complete, but it was later set aside to focus on other models. Will <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/genesis/">Genesis</a> bring it to life?</p>

      <h1>Nervous rex: the Davos elite brace for Trump and his dinosaur diplomacy</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Leaders of EU, France and Canada stake out positions on Greenland ahead of US president’s speech to World Economic Forum</p>
<p>“There’s no diplomacy with Donald Trump: he’s a T rex. You mate with him or he devours you.” Debate at the World Economic Forum annual meetings high in the Swiss Alps is usually scrupulously polite, but as this year’s gathering got under way in Davos on Tuesday, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had this blunt advice for handling the week’s star speaker.</p>
<p>The US president was yet to arrive but throughout the blond wood congress centre the hottest topic among the global elite of business and politics – on and off conference stages – was Trump’s intemperate attack on European allies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/trump-tariff-european-countries-greenland">threatening punitive tariffs</a> if they fail to let him annex Greenland.</p>

      <h1>Trump airing Macron’s private message was designed to hurt and intimidate</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>The US president uses mass communication to destabilise his rivals, but the risk is that frank exchange may dry up</p>
<p>The words “private and confidential” have never meant a great deal to Donald Trump. In his discussions with other world leaders, he has never operated much of a filter, happy to provide not just the facts of a conversation but also its content and tone, with descriptions all the way from beautiful to nasty.</p>
<p>But it is a new development (barring bits of mildly solicitous correspondence from Volodymyr Zelenskyy last year) for him to simply copy and paste the entirety of private messages on to social media, as he did in the case of Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to set up a G7 meeting in Paris to discuss Greenland, Ukraine and Syria.</p>

      <p>The US president’s global club was endorsed by the security council on a false prospectus and seems aimed at displacing the United Nations</p>
<p>Like many punters who have tried to do business with Donald Trump in the past, the UN has found itself a victim of a classic bait-and-switch, thinking it was buying one thing, but getting quite another.</p>
<p>When they voted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan">endorse</a> the board of peace in November, other members of the UN security council hoped they were binding Trump into a Gaza peace process, but it now appears they were hoodwinked into backing a Trump-dominated pay-to-play club: a global version of his Mar-a-Lago court aimed at supplanting the UN itself.</p>

<p><strong>Scott Bessent then denies that European Union countries, and the UK, could exercise the “nuclear option” over the Greenland crisis, and dump their holdings of US Treasuries.</strong></p>
<p>Asked how the Treasury Department, and the White House, would prepare for this, <strong>Bessent</strong> insists it is a “completely false narrative”, and claims the media are “hysterical” over the issue.</p>
<p>I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on April 2nd. There was a panic.</p>
<p>What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out.</p>
<p>What president Trump is threatening on Greenland is very different than the other trade deals. So I would urge all countries to stick with their trade deals.</p>

      <p>Today is the second day of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. It's a meeting that attracts some of the world's most powerful people (and often protests). Among the biggest names are the heads of Microsoft and Nvidia, the chancellor of Germany, and — after a six-year in-person absence — President Donald Trump is returning to the forum. We'll outline what to expect. But first: a discussion of housing and tariffs.</p>

      <p>Democrats lead legislative charge to block imposition of tariffs as some Republicans break from Trump</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties promised legislative action to block Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs against European allies on Monday, though Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/republicans-trump-greenland">willing to publicly break</a> with the president on Greenland remain in short supply.</p>
<p>Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, announced plans to <a href="https://x.com/SenPeterWelch/status/2013412716531126414?s=20">introduce a resolution</a> aimed at terminating tariffs Trump threatened to impose over the weekend on eight European countries, including Nato allies Denmark, the UK, Germany and France. The president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/16/trump-greenland-envoy-us-denmark">first mused</a> about the tariffs on Friday at a White House roundtable, then punctuated his threat with new details that included a 10% levy beginning in February, escalating to 25% by June unless a deal is reached for what he called the “Complete and Total purchase of Greenland”.</p>

<p>Federal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> agents forced open a door and detained a US citizen in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesota</a> home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out on to the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap on Sunday afternoon and said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.</p>

      <p>Jannik Sinner started his title defence, Naomi Osaka won in three sets after turning heads with her outfit and Katie Boulter was beaten by the in-form Belinda Bencic</p>
<p><strong>Fritz’s 2025 was a slight disappointment</strong>, he didn’t quite push on from his US Open final appearance in 2024, and as a result he’s no longer the highest-ranked American – that’s Ben Shelton. Fritz has also been dealing with a knee injury during the early stages of this season, but he leads Royer, the Frenchman who’s making his Australian Open debut, 7-6, 5-5.</p>
<p>I’m loving the new multiview action on Discovery+. It’s making this job much easier. Gone are the days of needing an extra laptop, mobile and iPad just to keep track of everything. <strong>So I’m currently keeping an eye on Sinner v Gaston, Boulter v Bencic, Fritz v Royer and Dimitrov v Machac</strong>.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Miami Dolphins hired former Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their coach on Monday, ending a swift search and tasking him with turning around a franchise that hasn’t won a playoff game in 25 years. Meanwhile, another coaching source is reportedly over with the Tennessee Titans hiring San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.</p>
<p>Hafley replaces Mike McDaniel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/08/dolphins-fire-mike-mcdaniel-after-missing-playoffs-for-second-season-in-row">who was fired earlier this month</a> after going 35-33 in four seasons. The Dolphins also fired longtime general manager Chris Grier during the season. Saleh spent this season as the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator, his second stint in that job after spending three-plus seasons as coach of the New York Jets. He did not have a winning season with the Jets and was fired after a 2-3 start in 2024, going 20-36 overall. But the 46-year-old still had a strong reputation around the league and was a sought-after candidate in this busy coaching cycle.</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Fears over the future of humanities spread amid layoffs and restructurings at scores of public and private universities</p>
<p>Last month, students at Montclair State University in New Jersey held a mock funeral outside the university’s college of humanities and social sciences building. Carrying bouquets of flowers, they stood by a tombstone inscribed with the names of the school’s 15 departments, including English, history and sociology.</p>
<p>“We are gathered here today, in front of the humble home of CHSS, Dickson Hall, to mourn the death of the social sciences and humanities at the hands of the MSU administration,” Miranda Kawiecki, a junior at the college and one of the protest’s organizers, read from a written eulogy. “I coordinated this demonstration because I have dreams that cannot be monetized. I have a problem with our society that cannot be solved with an algorithm. I have words to write and say that cannot be generated artificially.”</p>

<p>Hackers disrupted Iranian state television satellite transmissions to air footage supporting the country's exiled crown prince and calling on security forces to not &quot;point your weapons at the people,&quot; online video showed early Monday, the latest disruption to follow nationwide protests in the country.</p>

      <h1>LeBron James misses out as NBA All-Star starter for first time in 22 years</h1>

<li>
<p>World team will play US teams in mini-tournament</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James could still make team as a reserve</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first-ever World team for the NBA All-Star Game already looks loaded. And the fate of LeBron James’ record streak of All-Star selections will now be decided by coaches, or perhaps even Commissioner Adam Silver.</p>
<p>Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Denver’s Nikola Jokić, the Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Dončić and San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama were among those announced Monday as starters – an inexact term this year – for next month’s All-Star Game at the Los Angeles Clippers’ home arena in Inglewood, California. They’re likely heading to the World team, which will take on two teams of US players as part of yet another new format for the midseason showcase.</p>
<p>The NBA announced 10 starters, five from each conference. Golden State’s Stephen Curry, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Detroit’s Cade Cunningham, Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey and Boston’s Jaylen Brown all are presumably headed to the US squads that will play in the three-team, round-robin tournament on 15 February – all 12-minute mini-games, with the top two teams advancing to a 12-minute championship game.</p>

<p>Ben Maize, a Calgary man accused of tunnelling into his neighbour’s apartment, ran his own criminal trial Monday. Betty Golightly testified that she arrived home one day to find her apartment locked from the inside, then discovered holes in the drywall near her fireplace that appeared to lead to a tunnel to the unit below.</p>

<p>There are strong signals Canada could fall short of its legally-binding emissions targets, as federal data shows the goal for 2030 is likely out of reach. But beyond the numbers, there’s another issue. The group meant to guide Canada to meet those targets is slowly bleeding out.</p>

<p>Toady, or not toady? That is the question. When even Piers Morgan has taken his head out of Donald Trump’s bum far enough to see a glimmer of daylight, then it’s fair to say the US president has probably overstepped the mark.</p>
<p>Not content with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/trump-tariff-european-countries-greenland">threatening tariffs</a> against the UK and seven EU countries for sending troops to Greenland – having previously demanded Nato allies get stuck in to protect the country from Russia and China – The Donald has now sent a letter to the Norwegian prime minister to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/19/donald-trump-greenland-threats-nobel-prize-snub-letter">complain about not winning the Nobel peace prize</a> and to say he was so pissed off he was thinking of starting a war instead.</p>

      <h1>Sometimes a little lipstick goes a long way</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>It's called the &quot;lipstick effect.&quot; Consumers sometimes splurge on small luxuries — like cosmetics, accessories, and more — as a sort of rebellion against a bleak economic backdrop. And these indulgent purchases are expected to be big in the year ahead. Also: the toll tariffs have taken on the economy as Trump threatens more over Greenland and the impact of a growing number of millionaires in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>The Bills <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/17/broncos-bills-afc-championship-overtime-win">lost a dramatic divisional round game</a> in overtime to the Denver Broncos on Saturday. Buffalo have reached the playoffs in all but one of the seasons since McDermott took over in 2017, when he helped the Bills reach the postseason for the first time in 17 years. However, they have failed to reach the Super Bowl in that time despite the presence of Josh Allen, one of the best quarterbacks of his generation. Under McDermott, the Bills became the first team to win a playoff game in six straight seasons and not claim a Super Bowl.</p>

      <h1>Tickets, travel and Trump: How the 2026 World Cup is shaping up six months from the final</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>The champion will be decided on 19 July in New Jersey. Here’s a rundown of the issues that will shape the tournament as it comes to North America</p>
<p>We’re only six months from the biggest single sporting occasion in the world. On 19 July in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the men’s World Cup final will kick off and a champion will be crowned (although it will be hard to top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/qatar-2022-dishes-up-sporting-surprise-and-a-coronation-for-lionel-messi">the last one</a>).</p>
<p>The final will be more than a coronation (or confirmation, if Argentina repeat as champions). It will also be a culmination of six weeks of near non-stop soccer played across three countries, four time zones, and 16 cities. It’s likely that conclusions will already be drawn at that point on how the whole tournament fared. But for now, at this semi-convenient milestone, it’s worth taking stock of where we are six months out.</p>

Now, he's threatening to increase tariffs on eight European countries unless they agree to let the U.S. purchase the Danish territory, and the European Union is considering retaliation with its own tariffs on U.S. products. Also on the show: Europe is emerging as a major new destination for low-cost items from China.</p>

<p>One month after the justice department’s congressionally mandated deadline to release all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> investigative files went unmet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/07/epstein-files-survivors-trump-justice-department">victims’ advocates</a> are expressing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/20/trump-justice-department-legal-threats-epstein-files-release">outrage</a> over the department’s failure to comply with federal law.</p>
<p>Advocates have also indicated that they are not surprised, describing the justice department’s noncompliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act as yet another example of US officials failing to hold wrongdoers accountable in the ongoing saga.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Critics draw ‘direct line’ between content by Nick Sortor and similar figures and violent actions of federal agents</p>
<p>A rightwing influencer, who appeared to admit that he recently drove his truck at protesters in Minneapolis, has for years cooperated with the Trump administration even while he has been repeatedly accused of escalating conflict for video content he pumps out to 1.2 million followers on X.</p>
<p>Nick Sortor has received full-throated support of the Trump administration after an October arrest in Portland, and attended an October 2025 <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-participates-in-a-roundtable-on-antifa/666889">White House influencer roundtable on “antifa”</a>.</p>

<p>The law was clear: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s Department of Justice was required to disclose all investigative files on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> by 19 December 2025, with rare exceptions.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s tariff threats over Greenland risk triggering a “spiral of escalation” that would damage the world economy and lead to a sharp sell-off in financial markets, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.</p>
<p>In an update as Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/tariffs">threatened to impose tariffs on Nato allies</a> opposed to his ambition to take over the Arctic territory from Denmark, the Washington-based fund said a renewed eruption in trade tensions was among the biggest risks to global growth in 2026.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump links Greenland seizure threats to Nobel snub in letter to Norway’s prime minister. Plus, unseen home video of Martin Luther King Jr</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has linked his repeated threats to seize control of Greenland to his failure to receive the Nobel peace prize, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/19/donald-trump-greenland-threats-nobel-prize-snub-letter">an extraordinary letter</a> sent to the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre.</p>
<p><strong>What else has Trump said about Greenland this weekend?</strong> The US president on Saturday threatened to impose a 10% tariff on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland from 1 February until the US is allowed to buy the Arctic island.</p>
<p><strong>How have those countries responded?</strong> The EU is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/19/keir-starmer-greenland-tariffs-donald-trump-uk-politics-latest-news-updates">weighing up retaliatory tariffs</a> on US goods and even the use of its most severe economic sanctions as European leaders lined up to criticise Trump’s threat, which one minister described as “blackmail”.</p>
<p><strong>How has the city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, responded?</strong> He said on Sunday that any military deployment would be “ridiculous” and would only exacerbate tensions in Minnesota’s largest city, where the Trump administration has sent 3,000 immigration and border patrol officers who have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2026/jan/15/minneapolis-ice-renee-good-protests-in-photos">faced largely peaceful protests</a>.</p>

<p>When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> ordered a surge of armed federal immigration enforcement personnel on to the streets of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, the Department of Homeland Security declared it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minneapolis-ice-renee-nicole-good">the largest</a> operation in its history and the liberal midwestern city became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s latest chosen hotspot.</p>
<p>Such escalations mark the US president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">agenda of</a> mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data">arrests</a> and deportations from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/us-immigrant-population-declines">US interior</a>. The highest-profile efforts involve officers from multiple agencies rushing to prominent Democratic-led US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/chicago-fight-ice-raids">cities</a>, against local leaders’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/chicago-mayor-executive-order-trump-immigration-raids">wishes</a>. But coast to coast, federal officers have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/16/ice-immigration-minnesota-families">raiding</a> homes, businesses, commercial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/home-depot-ice-raids-los-angeles">parking lots</a> – even schools, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/california-ice-hospitals-patient-care">hospitals</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/new-york-immigration-courts-photo-essay">courthouses</a>.

      <h1>Afraid to take vacation? The problem isn’t your boss – it’s how you work</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>Many people use their vacation time each year. These people take ownership of their jobs, and make sure they get them done</p>
<p>A recent survey of more than 3,000 US workers for employment search site <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/pto-statistics">FlexJobs</a> found that almost a quarter didn’t take a vacation day during the past year and – more concerning to the study’s authors – as many as 82% “avoid using” their accrued time off. Why?</p>
<p>Kelsey Szamet, an employment lawyer, says the reason is a shift in mentality. “Many employees are concerned about the security of their jobs,” she <a href="https://qz.com/us-workers-americans-vacation-time-off?ut">told Quartz</a>. “The adoption of AI and automation technologies has allowed employees to actually consider their own replaceability before requesting a leave or a holiday, or any kind of time-off benefit.”</p>

      <h1>The 'biohacking' trend that has tech workers experimenting on themselves</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>In an industry known for pushing the bounds of human innovation, tech elites are now trying to push the bounds of their own bodies. The hot new biohacking trend is injectable peptides — similar to the ones found in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic. But these are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>These gray-market peptides, largely from Chinese manufacturers, are being used by tech workers and founders. Not just to lose weight, but to optimize their health and performance in all manner of ways. “Marketplace Tech” host Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with independent journalist Jasmine Sun, who recently wrote about this for the New York Times.</p>

<p>Some of the films were in worn-out film canisters, and Ipock worried they’d soon be unplayable. “I decided that I should have the family films digitized, so that we’ll always have a copy in the event of a catastrophe,” he said.</p>

      <h1>Indiana's rise to CFP final is a tale for our topsy-turvy times</h1>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>If Rudy was a charming underdog story, the Hoosiers’ worst-to-first ascent to college football’s title game on Monday night is the stuff of science fiction</p>
<p>We are living in upside down times. Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/kim-kardashian-menendez-brothers">advocates for prison reform</a> as the American government spams out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/trump-memes-immigration-deportation">cartoonish memes</a> promoting mass deportation and detention. Dave Chappelle – flaws aside – is more trusted to interpret the news than CBS’s Tony Dokoupil. The selection committee behind college football’s playoff somehow put together a compelling tournament without inciting the usual torrent of backlash, and the team raising the trophy at the end could well wind up being <em>Indiana</em>. And, no, that’s not a typo.</p>
<p>In case it’s unclear, Indiana is basketballcountry – the birthplace of Larry Bird, the home of the NBA’s Pacers, the inspiration behind Gene Hackman’s Hoosiers. Tier-one campus research, Bobby Knight’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/01/bob-knight-basketball-coach-dead-indiana-hoosiers">tempestuous hardwood reign</a>, and Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban are Indiana University’s claims to fame; football rarely, if ever, entered the chat. Before the NFL’s Colts <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/sports/indianapolis-colts/march-28-1984-when-the-colts-ditched-baltimore-and-moved-to-indy-overnight/">snuck in</a> from Baltimore and blended into Indiana’s sports tapestry, Hoosiers fans spent football season rallying around Notre Dame, a national brand that happens to reside in-state, and saved their true colors for the college basketball tipoff.</p>

      <p>Caleb Williams pulled off a miracle against the Rams and Chicago looked destined for the Super Bowl. The hope wouldn’t last long</p>
<p>A playoff game often pivots on a single moment. The Bears thought they had theirs. Down a score, driving to keep the game alive, the Bears had the ball on the Rams’ 14-yard line. Fourth down. Four yards to pick up a fresh set of downs. A play to keep their season alive. The ball in Caleb Williams’s hands.</p>
<p>And then it happened.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of January 2026. It’s a brand new year and many retailers are trying to start it off strong, snagging customers who might regret not getting an e-bike during the holiday season. So you just might find a better deal than you were expecting on a new e-bike. Check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>Should a police officer be able to pull you over without a reason? The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on a Quebec case that deals with exactly that. Proponents of random police traffic stops say they're important to stop drunk drivers. Detractors say they open the door to racial profiling.</p>

<p>Anti-ICE protests continued throughout Minnesota over the weekend, as they have for nearly two weeks now. Since the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, ICE agents have been getting in confrontations with the people they are targeting, and the citizens attempting to observe and document ICE’s actions. The city and state are on a razor’s edge — trying to observe and protest while not giving U.S. President Donald Trump an opportunity to escalate. Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military troops against protesters, with some 1,500 troops reportedly standing ready.
Can he do that? And can anything be done to restrain the power of ICE officers deployed to Minneapolis and beyond?
Today we hear from Aaron Reichlin-Melnick. He’s a Senior Fellow at the American Immigration Council and has been following all of this very closely.</p>

<p>Hundreds of counterprotesters on Saturday drowned out a far-right activist’s attempt to hold a small rally in support of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s latest immigration crackdown in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p>Conservative influencer Jake Lang organized an anti-Islam, anti-Somali and pro-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstration, saying on social media beforehand that he intended to “burn a Quran” on the steps of City Hall. But it was not clear if he carried out that plan.</p>

<p>I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget <em>does</em>, but who it does it <em>for</em>, and who it does it <em>to.</em></p>
<p>What I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.</p>

<p>Up two service breaks at 4-0 in the third set on Sunday, she was within sight of victory too.

      <p>Korey LaVergne, 37, jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to officials</p>
<p>Authorities in south-west <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> recently arrested a Roman Catholic priest on accusations of behaving indecently with a child, igniting a new scandal in the diocese where the US church’s reckoning with clergy abuse began – an institution that just disclosed it could lose up to $162m over pending litigation.</p>
<p>Korey LaVergne was jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to Acadia parish sheriff KP Gibson, whose agency arrested the priest. LaVergne had presided over mass at St Edward church in Richard – where the Lafayette diocese had assigned him as pastor – hours before he was booked into the Acadia lockup.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is borrowing a strategy from authoritarian regimes to intimidate potential critics and discourage them from speaking out, according to a senator under investigation by his administration.</p>
<p>Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, faces questioning after she organised and appeared in a video with other Democrats imploring military service members to refuse “illegal orders”. Fellow senator Mark Kelly and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/house-democrats-doj-military-video">three Democrats</a> from the House of Representatives are also being investigated.</p>

      <p>Many believed a US president would – for the first time – rescue them but now people can only despair after mass arrests and brutality</p>
<p>When Donald Trump, said he would “rescue” protesters if Iranian authorities started shooting, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/15/iran-protesters-uprising-killed-world-diaspora-families-tehran-internet-blackout">Siavash Shirzad</a> believed the US president.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old father had seen protests rise up before, only to be brutally crushed by authorities.</p>
<p>But this was the first time in his life that the president of the United States had promised to help demonstrators. Reassured, Shirzad took to the streets, ignoring his family’s warnings and joining the growing crowds.</p>

      <h1>‘You don’t want this smoke’: US sheriff reflects on her viral remarks about ICE</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>Philadelphia sheriff Rochelle Bilal’s words have become a rallying cry against Trump’s immigration crackdown</p>
<p>“You don’t want this smoke,” Rochelle Bilal, Philadelphia’s sheriff, warned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> agents during an 8 January <a href="https://www.facebook.com/philaDAO/videos/1420922789561247">press conference</a>. Her words have since become a rallying cry for resistance to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. At the conference with Larry Krasner, Philadelphia’s district attorney, and city council members, Bilal spoke out against the 7 January fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. “We stand here today with all those who stand against the made-up, fake, what you can call ICE, professional law enforcement,” she said at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ATLBlackStar/videos/sheriff-said-you-dont-want-the-smoke-philadelphia-sheriff-rochelle-bilal-is-esca/1327941529378573/">conference</a>. “I don’t call them none of that. I call them made-up, fake, wannabe law enforcement. Because what they do is against not only legal law, but the moral law.”</p>
<p>Bilal is part of a growing body of elected officials who are speaking out against the Trump administration’s immigration policies and ICE’s alleged misconduct and aggressive enforcement tactics. As the <a href="https://6abc.com/post/philadelphia-elects-its-first-female-sheriff/5675512/#:~:text=ELECTION%202019:%20Philadelphia%20elects%20its,first%20time%20since%20Civil%20War">first</a> Black female sheriff of Philadelphia elected in 2019, Bilal has faced perhaps the most vitriol from opponents who have targeted her for her race and gender. “Race played a big [role in the] response,” Bilal told the Guardian in a conference room on her Philadelphia office floor. “The negative, nasty messages that are being received is ridiculous.” Since the video of her speech went viral, Bilal told the Guardian that death threats that she’s received have required her to increase her security detail. In a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/icegov/videos/philadelphia-sheriff-rochelle-bilal-should-resign-before-she-embarrasses-herself/1232119605462885/">post</a>, ICE also said that she should resign.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has comprehensively failed to meet a key election promise to slash Americans’ energy bills in half within the first year of his presidency, with power prices instead surging across the US.</p>
<p>The average household electricity bill in the US was 6.7% more expensive in 2025 compared with the previous year, according to a Guardian analysis of data from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), the Department of Energy’s statistical arm. The increases meant that, on average, US households paid nearly $116 more across 2025 than they did in 2024.</p>

      <p>Chris LaCivita sued news outlet over 2024 story about large payments from Trump campaign to his consulting firm</p>
<p>A manager for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s 2024 presidential election bid has abandoned a high-profile lawsuit against the Daily Beast, 10 months after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/daily-beast-trump-campaign-chief-chis-lacivita-lawsuit">complaining</a> the news outlet had defamed him in reporting on campaign expenditures.</p>
<p>Chris LaCivita, who co-managed the campaign that led to Trump’s second presidency, quietly dropped his legal action on Friday, the Daily Beast said. The outlet said it had not retracted the story, made no apology and had not made any cash payment to LaCivita.</p>

      <h1>Trump pardons Florida fraudster after commuting her sentence during his first term</h1>

(date: 2026-01-17)
      <p>
      <p>President’s pardon of Adriana Camberos comes amid a flurry of other pardons Trump issued on Thursday</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has pardoned a woman who ended up imprisoned for fraud a second time after he afforded her clemency during his first presidency.</p>
<p>Adriana Camberos initially had a sentence commuted by Trump just before his first stint in the White House ended in 2021. That came after she was convicted as part of an effort to divert 5-Hour Energy drink bottles acquired for resale in Mexico and instead keep them in the US. Prosecutors said she and several co-conspirators attached counterfeit labels and filled the bottles with a phony liquid before selling them.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s renewed interest in taking control of Greenland has become a subject of pointed dissent among congressional Republicans, with several allies speaking out in recent days against the idea after the president reintensified his interest following the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans are typically loath to disagree openly with the president, who has repeatedly called for his party’s dissenters to be voted out of office. But amid <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/politics/greenland-cnn-poll">polling</a> that shows an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island and warnings from Denmark that an invasion would spell the end of Nato, some congressional Republicans have issued forceful warnings against pursuing the issue.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announces tariffs on several European countries if they don't back U.S. plans to take over Greenland. The move comes as protests take place and a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support.</p>

      <p>Mark Davis, running in Florida, says he bought domain because Republican party had gone ‘full fascist’</p>
<p>A Florida congressional candidate says he bought the online domain <a href="http://nazis.us">nazis.us</a> and set it up to redirect visitors to the US Department of Homeland Security, under whom federal agents have been carrying out brutal immigration crackdowns at the behest of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Mark Davis, who is running for Republican Vern Buchanan’s US House seat in November’s midterms, took responsibility for the ploy in a Friday X post – as polling showed most Americans believe the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent demonstrated problems with the way ICE has been operating.</p>

</ul>
<p>The crisis over Greenland may deliver the moment when Europe must stand up to Donald Trump, as officials have said a US attempt to annex the territory could shatter the Nato transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>European leaders have entertained Trump’s demands for nearly a year as he has pushed Nato countries to increase their defence spending to 5% of GDP, and threatened to pull US support from Ukraine as part of a peace process that appears to favour Russia. They have also given a muted response to US adventurism abroad including the capture and rendition of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>The White House said the seven-strong “founding executive board” will also include Trump’s special envoy, the property developer Steve Witkoff; the World Bank president, Ajay Banga; and the president’s son-in-law and long-time adviser Jared Kushner. Trump himself will serve as chair, with further appointments expected in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>An AI-driven construction boom is coming, some hope. But to build all that infrastructure, the U.S. is going to need a lot more construction workers, plumbers, HVAC technicians, and other skilled workers. And President Trump’s immigration policies actively work against that goal. Also in this episode: Trump withdraws the U.S. from a key global climate change agreement, Americans shell out for at-home coffee setups, and Kai discusses the week’s economic headlines with Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal and Amara Omeokwe at Bloomberg.</p>

      <h1>Virginia to vote on Democrat-favored redistricting after lawmakers advance plan</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>Virginia joins states from California to Florida in mid-decade redistricting push after party-line senate vote</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a> lawmakers approved a measure on Friday that could ultimately clear the way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> to redraw the state’s congressional maps and add as many as four Democratic-leaning seats.</p>
<p>The legislature sent voters a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmakers to redraw the lines this year and circumvent a panel that is supposed to be in charge of drawing district lines. Democrats currently represent six of Virginia’s 11 congressional districts, and have said they will pursue a plan in which they are favored in either nine or 10 of the state’s congressional districts.</p>

<p>Porsche’s all-electric Macan outsold its combustion-engined one in 2025, the only model where the company sells both gas and electric versions. And yet, the company still recently committed to delaying future EV models and extending availability of combustion ones, despite the weakness that combustion car sales are showing globally.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has been gifted the Nobel peace prize medal by Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. The gesture comes after Machado was unexpectedly sidelined by Trump when US forces abducted her political rival, Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro. Her supporters had hoped Trump would recognise her as Venezuela's new leader, but instead he gave his support to the dictator’s second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez.</p>

The Trump administration has filed similar lawsuits <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/tracker-justice-department-requests-voter-information">in nearly half</a> of US states.</p>
<p>Last summer, the justice department asked California for a list of all voters, including their dates of birth and the last four digits of their social security number, claiming the information was needed to ensure the state was keeping ineligible voters off its rolls. California’s secretary of state offered to let the justice department inspect a redacted version of the voter registration list, but refused to turn over all of the requested information. The justice department responded by filing a lawsuit against the state and went on to file similar litigation in 23 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>In air freight – despite the extraordinary value of bullion – fresh flowers, food and other perishables still take priority. “We learned this the hard way,” Jorgovanka Tabaković <a href="https://www.nbs.rs/en/scripts/showcontent/index.html?id=21045">told a conference</a> late last year.</p>

      <h1>Corporate leaders in Minnesota stay silent amid ICE raids. Why?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>Minnesota is home to more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies, including 3M, Target, Best Buy, and General Mills. But in a wave of wake immigration arrests and ICE's killing of 37-year-old Renee Good, executives from many of the state's leading corporations have been noticeably quiet. This morning, we'll examine why exactly that is. But first, enrollment at community colleges was up for the fourth fall in a row.</p>

      <h1>They couldn’t ‘Abolish ICE’ in Trump’s first term. Now more Americans are taking up the call</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>To longtime immigrant rights activists, the reckoning around the fatal shooting in Minnesota may feel familiar</p>
<p>As mass protests erupted over the past week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed Renee Nicole Good, thousands of Americans hoisted signs and marched to thunderous chants of “abolish ICE”.</p>
<p>The mantra has quickly captured the bursting anger and grief of a nation; activists and progressive lawmakers like the representative Ayanna Pressley, and even the conservative commentator <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billkristolbulwark.bsky.social/post/3mbucyb5afk2v">Bill Kristol</a> have embraced the demand. Shri Thanedar, a Democratic representative from Michigan, said he planned to introduce the “Abolish ICE act”, a bill that would dismantle the federal agency and its current enforcement authority. For the first time, more US adults now support eliminating ICE than those who oppose it, according to a <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_qsNv5iE.pdf">new Economist/YouGov poll</a>.</p>

      <p>As hospitals scramble and country reaches record-breaking rates of illness, officials cast doubt on flu shot’s necessity</p>
<p>As the US reaches record-breaking rates of illness and hospitals scramble to care for flu patients, officials have stopped fully recommending the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/flu">flu</a> shot, casting doubt on the necessity and effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines">vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>“We are in the midst of a very severe flu season,” said Seema Lakdawala, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory School of Medicine. Despite this, the US is dismantling many of its vaccine recommendations. Flu vaccine recommendations for children <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations">changed</a> in early January to “shared clinical decision-making”, which has typically meant a provider recommends the shot.</p>

<p>The death of a man who was being held at a federal detention camp in Texas in early January <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/ice-detention-camp-texas-death">may be investigated as a homicide</a> after the local medical examiner reportedly found the preliminary cause was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”.</p>
<p><strong>What did ICE say about his death?</strong> In a press release, the agency claimed he died after “experiencing medical distress” and said his cause of death was under investigation.</p>
<p><strong>What have the peace prize organi</strong> <strong>zers said?</strong> Earlier in the day, they posted on X: “A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel peace prize laureate cannot.”</p>

      <p>Those massive AI data centers going in across the country can use as much energy as an entire city. President Trump said this week he wants tech companies to &quot;pay their own way,&quot; and touted a new Microsoft pledge to bear the full cost of their AI energy needs.</p>
<p>Plus, Apple announces its long awaited new AI Siri will be powered by Google.</p>
<p>But first, Nvidia can once again export its second best H200 chips to China if it follows some new security rules and pays the U.S. government 25% of its sales. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, to discuss all these topics on this week’s “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.”</p>

      <p>The postseason continues with the Broncos and Seahawks entering the fray, but there could be trouble for one of the frontrunners</p>
<p><strong>What <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/buffalo-bills">the Bills</a> need to do to win:</strong> Keep winning short-yardage situations. The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/11/buffalo-bills-jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-playoffs-wilcard">helped secure Buffalo’s win</a> over Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.</p>

      <h1>Trump's latest plan to lower mortgage rates</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump recently ordered government-backed mortgage companies (that’s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to buy up $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The last time they bought these bonds was the 2008 financial crisis. Will the move actually lower rates? Probably not much.

      <p>Karoline Leavitt brands journalist who asked about deaths in ICE custody and killing of Renee Good ‘a leftwing activist’</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused a reporter of being a “leftwing activist” during a heated confrontation on Thursday over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.</p>
<p>Beginning his question during the White House press briefing, Niall Stanage, a White House columnist for the Hill, referred to the Trump administration’s staunch defense of ICE agents and the assertion by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that ICE are “doing everything correctly”. He pointed to statistics showing that last year 32 people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline">died in ICE custody</a> and 170 US citizens were <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">detained by ICE</a>, before noting that Good was “shot in the head and killed by an ICE agent”.</p>

      <p>Setback for president, who has called windfarms ‘losers’, as Empire Wind project allowed to move forward</p>
<p>A federal judge on Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would probably kill the project in a matter of days.</p>
<p>District judge Carl J Nichols, an appointee of Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government’s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.</p>

      <h1>Geopolitical football: Iran? Trump? How the game can stand strong in a fractured world</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>The 2026 World Cup is set to be a polarising event but, even if it will not be the first to be politically contentious, it will expose a growing unease</p>
<p>Five months out from the World Cup the politics are impossible to avoid. There are concerns relating to one of the host countries, the US, with armed immigration officials roaming through its cities and visa restrictions <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/trump-administration-news-latest-updates-today">stepped up against foreign visitors</a>. One qualifying nation, Iran, is experiencing a public uprising against its leadership, with the regime attacking its citizens in response. Among other qualifiers there are concerns over democratic backsliding in Tunisia, ecological crimes in Ecuador and , in the future host country Saudi Arabia. And that’s just for starters.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels as if this summer’s tournament, the one Gianni Infantino recently described as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth”, will serve as an inescapable reminder of the depressing state of the world in 2026. It could yet be an event that goes down in infamy. But it is hardly the only tournament to have prompted ethical concerns and serves as a reminder that the issue of how global sport should engage with such issues has remained largely unresolved.</p>

</ul>
<p>A sprawling betting scheme to rig NCAA and Chinese Basketball Association games has led to charges against 26 people, including more than a dozen college basketball players who tried to fix games as recently as last season, federal prosecutors said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The scheme generally revolved around fixers recruiting players with the promise of a big payment in exchange for those players purposefully underperforming during a game, prosecutors said. The fixers then placed large bets against those players’ teams, defrauding sportsbooks and other bettors, according to the indictment unsealed on Thursday.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that ordered the release of the former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention, delivering Donald Trump’s administration a victory in its efforts to deport the pro-Palestinian activist.</p>
<p>A 2-1 panel of the Philadelphia-based third US circuit court of appeals ordered the dismissal of a lawsuit Khalil filed challenging his detention after finding that federal immigration law stripped the lower court of jurisdiction over his claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">AI</a> chips, such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nvidia">Nvidia</a> H200 AI processor ​and a similar semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X, under a new national security order released by the White House.</p>
<p>The proclamation follows a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-initiates-section-232-investigations-into-pharmaceutical-semiconductor-2025-04-14/">nine-month investigation</a> under ‌section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and targets a number of high-end semiconductors meeting certain performance benchmarks and devices containing them for import duties. The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.</p>

<p>Canada’s skeleton team have been cleared of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/12/usa-canada-skeleton-winter-olympics-cheating-allegations">allegations they rigged</a> a qualifying event for the Winter Olympics and denied rival athletes the chance to qualify for next month’s Games.</p>
<p>USA’s Katie Uhlaender, a five-time Winter Olympian in skeleton, accused the Canadian team of deliberately pulling four of its six athletes from a race in Lake Placid, New York, last weekend in order to make it harder for athletes from other countries to qualify. The reduced field meant fewer qualifying points were available and Uhlaender, who won the event, did not secure her place at this year’s Milano Cortina Games in Italy. Uhlaender claims Joe Cecchini, the head coach of Canada’s skeleton team, told her he had come up with the scheme.</p>

      <h1>The secret is out: how Australian Open helped usher in three-week slam festivals</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>Grand slam qualifying used to be an oasis for tennis hipsters but a game of one upmanship between the Australian and US Opens has set the standard for spectacular lead-in weeks</p>
<p>During the early days of the US Open singles main draw last year, the tournament director, Stacey Allaster, was holding court with a small group of journalists in a suite overlooking Arthur Ashe Stadium. Much of the discussion centred on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/18/us-open-2025-mixed-doubles-tennis">revamped mixed doubles tournament</a>, which had dominated the tennis discourse for days. With a smile, Allaster explained the amount of work that had gone into the event and cited the final attendance numbers for the week it was held. The US Open, she asserted, is now a three-week event.</p>
<p>For many years, the traditional grand slam fortnight was preceded by a nondescript week of preparation. While lower-ranked players quietly worked through the qualifying draw in front of vacant stands, the top players finished their preparation to minimal fanfare. Access to the tournament grounds at the Australian Open, French Open and US Open were free for qualifying. Still, few people came. To most hardcore fans, grand slam qualifying was an oasis for tennis hipsters, the sport’s best-kept secret.</p>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>With a huge audience and serving as an avatar for millions of centrist Americans, Rogan compares ICE raids to Gestapo</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/joe-rogan">Joe Rogan</a>’s comparison of US immigration raids to Gestapo operations, made during a podcast episode earlier this week, has sparked speculation about whether the wildly popular podcaster, who endorsed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in 2024, has fully soured on Trump’s presidency – and what that might say of the millions of <a href="https://yougov.com/en-gb/articles/47483-whos-listening-to-the-joe-rogan-experience-men-mostly">mainly</a> young men who listen to Rogan’s show.</p>
<p>Rogan’s views, as expressed in the podcast discussion, were more complicated than the Gestapo remark taken alone might make them seem. Yet even his more measured skepticism about ICE immigration raids feels somewhat significant, given Rogan’s cultural status and the evidence that Americans in general are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/12/15/growing-shares-say-the-trump-administration-is-doing-too-much-to-deport-immigrants-in-the-us-illegally/">turning</a> against Trump’s hardline anti-immigration efforts.</p>

      <p>Congressional Budget Office analysis says renaming – which Congress must approve – would cost US taxpayers millions</p>
<p>Renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War could cost US taxpayers as much as $125m depending on how broadly and quickly the change is made, according to an analysis released on Wednesday from the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>Donald Trump signed an executive order in September that authorized the Department of War as a secondary title for the Pentagon. At the time, Trump said the switch was intended to signal to the world that the US was a force to be reckoned with, and he complained that the Department of Defense’s name was “woke”.</p>

      <p>Saks Global — the luxury retail conglomerate that owns brands like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week. But given that higher-income consumers are driving so much of spending, why is a chain of luxury department stores struggling? Then, the Trump administration is ending a special protected status for 350,000 Haitians, and the elder-care industry is expected to lose thousands of workers as a result.</p>

Currently, there are only two active mines on the island, but many investors think there is potential in Greenland for additional commercial projects. Then, thanks to the climbing popularity of Korean skincare, South Korea has surpassed the U.S. to become the world's second-largest cosmetics exporter after France,</p>

<p>The justice department is undertaking an unprecedented effort to collect sensitive voter information about tens of millions of Americans, a push that relies on thin legal reasoning and which could be aimed at sowing doubt about the midterm election results this year.</p>
<p>The department has asked at least 43 states for their comprehensive information on voters, including the last four digits of their social security numbers, full dates of birth and addresses, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/tracker-justice-department-requests-voter-information">according to the Brennan Center for Justice</a>. Eight states have voluntarily turned over the information, according to the Brennan Center, and the department has sued 23 states and the District of Columbia for the information.</p>

      <p>
      <p>US president’s friend Ronald Lauder – who first proposed Arctic expansion – is now making deals in the island</p>
<p>One day during his first term, Donald Trump summoned a top aide to discuss a new idea. “Trump called me down to the Oval Office,” John Bolton, national security adviser in 2018, told the Guardian. “He said a prominent businessman had just suggested the US buy Greenland.”</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary proposal. And it originated from a longtime friend of the president who would go on to acquire business interests in the Danish territory.</p>

      <p>This is the moment a SpaceX capsule left the International Space Station on an emergency return flight to Earth prompted by a medical issue afflicting one of the astronauts. It is Nasa’s first medical evacuation, with the mission being cut a month short. Onboard were American astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, a Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, and a Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. Computer modelling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years but Nasa has not had one before in its 65 years of human spaceflight</p>

      <p>There are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balanced</p>
<p>David Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.</p>
<p>Current commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nba-finals-adam-silver-cd1d47349e0b3964645532f5e04ceb4e">said then</a> in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”</p>

      <h1>Why big oil giants may not rush to buy into Donald Trump’s Venezuelan vision</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>It may well be safer, easier and cheaper for US companies to procure whatever oil the US economy needs at home</p>
<p>There are a few reasons that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> – now self-anointed <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115879509461234235">acting president of Venezuela</a>, as well as the United States – might be so excited about appropriating Venezuela’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil">oil</a>.</p>
<p>Trump may be counting on some boost from cheap oil to the US economy: he is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/big-wins-for-american-families-as-gas-prices-mortgage-rates-plummet/">obsessed with the price of gas</a>. As the midterm elections approach, he has become <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/23/economy/trump-unemployment-rate-economy">concerned about unemployment</a>.

      <h1>Each NFL playoff team’s fatal flaw: the Bills’ run defense to the Sam Darnold problem</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>The eight remaining teams all have elements of brilliance. But they also have weaknesses that could send them crashing out of the postseason</p>
<p>Defending the run has long been a sore spot for the Bills – they finished the season 25th in defensive rush success rate. Inside, they lack mass, and are too easily pushed around by teams committed to a smashmouth approach. Outside, they struggle with discipline and technique. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/12/josh-allen-buffalo-bills-nfl-playoffs">Against Jacksonville last weekend</a>, both fell apart. The Jaguars rushed for 154 yards, with 119 of those yards coming on outside runs. It was the Jags’ highest total on outside runs this season. This weekend, against a Broncos offense that is happy to punch anyone in the mouth, that could put the Bills in a lot of trouble.</p>

      <h1>The crisis whisperer: how Adam Tooze makes sense of our bewildering age</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>Whether it’s the financial crash, the climate emergency or the breakdown of the international order, historian Adam Tooze has become the go-to guide to the radical new world we’ve entered</p>
<p>In late January 2025, 10 days after Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time as president of the United States, an economic conference in Brussels brought together several officials from the recently deposed Biden administration for a discussion about the global economy. In Washington, Trump and his wrecking crew were already busy razing every last brick of Joe Biden’s legacy, but in Brussels, the Democratic exiles put on a brave face. They summoned the comforting ghosts of white papers past, intoning old spells like “worker-centered trade policy” and “middle-out bottom-up economics”. They touted their late-term achievements. They even quoted poetry: “We did not go gently into that good night,” Katherine Tai, who served as Biden’s US trade representative, said from the stage. Tai proudly told the audience that before leaving office she and her team had worked hard to complete “a set of supply-chain-resiliency papers, a set of model negotiating texts, and a shipbuilding investigation”.</p>
<p>It was not until 70 minutes into the conversation that a discordant note was sounded, when Adam Tooze joined the panel remotely. Born in London, raised in West Germany, and living now in New York, where he teaches at Columbia, Tooze was for many years a successful but largely unknown academic. A decade ago he was recognised, when he was recognised at all, as an economic historian of Europe. Since 2018, however, when he published Crashed, his “contemporary history” of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, Tooze has become, in the words of Jonathan Derbyshire, his editor at the Financial Times, “a sort of platonic ideal of the universal intellectual”.</p>

<p>A man shot and wounded by a border patrol agent during an immigration stop in Portland last week has pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault against a federal officer and damaging federal property.</p>
<p>Luis David Nino-Moncada, who was taken into custody after sustaining an injury in the arm from the shooting, was indicted on Tuesday and entered his plea on Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security alleges that Nino-Moncada, who is of Venezuelan descent, entered the US illegally and used his vehicle as a weapon when agents attempted to apprehend him.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi says the search of a Washington Post reporter’s home was done at the Pentagon’s request as part of a leak investigation. The Post says journalist Hannah Natanson had a phone, two laptops and a watch seized by agents at her Virginia home. An FBI affidavit says the search was related to an investigation into a system administrator in Maryland who authorities believe took home classified reports. Natanson covers the Trump administration’s transformation of the federal government. A colleague has called her “the federal government whisperer.” The White House says leaking classified information puts America’s national security at risk.</p>

      <p>The unemployment rate in December among people aged 20 to 24 was 8.2%. That’s up nearly a full percentage point from 2024, and much higher than the overall unemployment rate of 4.4%. The job market is tough, and getting tougher, but why is it particularly hard for Gen Z? Also in this episode: Trump’s focus on Venezuelan crude could redirect Canadian oil, companies use surveillance data for “personalized” pricing, and China’s trade surplus grew by 20% last year, in spite of U.S. tariffs.</p>

      <p>Slate journalist Laura Jedeed documented hiring process and said she got offer despite not completing paperwork</p>
<p>A reporter has become embroiled in a public dispute with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> after penning an article on how she was in effect offered a position with the organization following an interview that took less than six minutes and did not require her to complete “a single signature on agency paperwork”.</p>
<p>Her hiring, and latter claim about the hiring process, have both been challenged by the Department of Homeland Security and called a “lie”.</p>

<p>Donut Lab lit the EV and energy storage industry on fire last week with its announcement of a 400 Wh/kg solid-state battery cell that can last for 100 years. At face value, if true, we are looking at the single most disruptive announcement in the history of the electric vehicle industry and energy storage as a whole.</p>
<p>We aren’t just talking about a better motorcycle battery. If the claims of a 5-minute charge, 100,000-cycle life, and ~400 Wh/kg energy density are accurate and scalable, as Donut Lab claims, this is the holy grail of energy storage.</p>
<p>Battery breakthrough announcements generally don’t catch fire like this, but Donut Lab’s did because it said that the cell was already in production and will be in a production vehicle, Verge’s electric motorcycle, this quarter. It gave credibility to the claim, pushing everyone to report on it.</p>
<p>Now, we have interviewed Donut Lab’s CEO and investigated the technology. At this point, it looks like either this battery changes the world within the next 3 months, or it will make the CEO look like a fool. In this article, we discuss the impact of the battery, whether real or not, as well as clues about the secret sauce behind its chemistry.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> on Wednesday revived a lawsuit by a Republican congressman in Illinois that challenges a state law allowing mail-in ballots to be counted if they are received after election day.</p>
<p>The lawsuit from Mike Bost was viewed by Donald Trump-aligned conservatives as an avenue to continue attacks on mail-in voting. Bost argued that the Illinois law allowing ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day if they are postmarked by the deadline unconstitutionally allows an extension of the election period.</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump traveled to Michigan yesterday to tout the economy's performance during his second administration. He spoke at the Detroit Economic Club for about an hour, but the speech included false or misleading information about inflation, wage growth, drug prices, tax breaks, and more. Today, we'll provide some fact-checking. Also on today's program, we'll learn about bank earnings, China's trade surplus, and what happens when Social Security funding runs out.</p>

<p>Six puppies in rural Washington state will soon be up for adoption after being revived after a suspected drug overdose – and some of them might go home with the fire-station staff who saved them.</p>
<p>Two people dropped off three of the sickened puppies at Sky Valley Fire, about an hour’s drive north-east of Seattle, on Sunday. Officials believe the animals either breathed or ate fentanyl.</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>USWNT stars have a world of options as their domestic league struggles to match European teams’ ambition</p>
<p>Sam Coffey’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/14/manchester-city-hail-new-signing-sam-coffey-world-best-midfielders-usa-portland-womens-football">transfer from the Portland Thorns to Manchester City</a> marks a tipping point: more than half of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/aug/10/brazil-v-uswnt-olympic-womens-soccer-final-latest-updates">USWNT’s starting lineup</a> that secured the 2024 Olympic gold medal now play their professional soccer in Europe. If free agent Trinity Rodman signs abroad, too, that’ll leave only four players from that lineup on NWSL rosters to start the domestic season.</p>
<p>The distribution of where USWNT players compete has dramatically shifted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/03/uswnt-emma-hayes-winners-losers-canada-ireland-2025">under Emma Hayes</a>. So many star players have headed to European Goliaths, including Hayes’s former club Chelsea, that last year she had to assure the NWSL board of governors she isn’t pushing her athletes to leave the league, per a <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46761788/uswnt-players-transfers-nwsl-europe-wsl">report</a> from ESPN. Hayes insists she simply supports her players’ aspirations, whatever they may be. Today, out of the seven players with the most USWNT minutes in 2025, only two of them – Emily Sonnett and Claire Hutton – are playing stateside.</p>

<p>‘When I get booed, I boo back,’ says two-time MVP</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn’t remember hearing boos from his home crowd during his brilliant 13-year career in Milwaukee. But it happened on Tuesday midway through the Bucks’ 139-106 loss to a Minnesota Timberwolves team playing without Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been a part of something like that before,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “Something new for me.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>The data centers needed to power AI are controversial in many communities. People worry about that extra demand driving up their electricity bills, which are already up almost 7% in a year. In response, Microsoft is pledging to pay extra for electricity to power its data centers and says it’ll work to prevent water resources from being drained by giant server farms. And later, we'll discuss the Trump administration's plan to control Venezuela's oil.</p>

Trump later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/14/iran-protests-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-the-spiralling-anti-government-protests">told CBS News</a>: “When they start killing thousands of people – and now you’re telling me about hanging.

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> China has announced record export numbers and the largest trade surplus in global history: $1.2 trillion. Despite the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, China has been able to pivot to other international trading partners, including countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Then, global bond markets are where governments go to raise money to pay for services, but have they become too powerful?</p>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>The pretty Swiss lakeside town of Lugano has set out to become Europe’s bitcoin capital, with the aim of attracting bitcoin companies and the cryptocurrency itself to the city. In Lugano, you can still pay for everything in Swiss francs, but in hundreds of shops and restaurants you can also pay in bitcoin. The city has even started accepting it for municipal services. The BBC’s John Laurenson went to check it out.</p>

<p>Tesla is officially killing the option to purchase its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package upfront. CEO Elon Musk announced today that the automaker will stop selling FSD as a one-time option and will instead only offer it as a monthly subscription.</p>
<p>It marks a massive shift in Tesla’s strategy for the software, which Musk has famously claimed for years would become an “appreciating asset.”</p>

<p>Leading US investors and private equity firms could step up their foray into UK new-build housing after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/trump-ban-investor-home-buying">Donald Trump’s move to ban institutional</a> companies from buying single-family homes in the US, raising concerns that investors could “cut corners and increase rents”.</p>
<p>The US president said last week that he would ask Congress to codify the measure as he tries to address concerns that families are struggling to buy or rent a home. The median property sale price was $410,800 (£305,000) last year, according to the US Census Bureau.</p>

<p>Eight people were arrested outside a federal building in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> on Tuesday, according to the Department of Homeland Security, as the Trump administration doubled down on threats to protesters and city and state officials who might try to impede their mass deportation agenda.</p>

      <p>The cost of food consumed at home was up 0.7% month-over-month in December, and 2.4% year-over-year. Go back five years, and grocery prices are up 25%. And like so many things in this economy, the rising cost hurts the poorest Americans most.

<p>Progressives in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">US Congress</a> on Tuesday vowed to oppose legislation funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless it included significant reforms to immigration enforcement following the killing of a US citizen in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesota</a> last week.</p>

<p>The US supreme court on Tuesday appeared poised to uphold laws banning transgender girls and women from competing in female sports in two conservative states, in a landmark legal battle that could carry profound implications for trans rights across US society.</p>
<p>During oral arguments on two cases of trans students who sued over Republican-supported laws in West Virginia and Idaho that barred them from girls sports, one member of the court’s conservative majority after another voiced skepticism about the students’ cases.</p>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Groups say EEOC demand for names and personal details echoes dark history and threatens safety and civil rights</p>
<p>Several faculty groups have denounced the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s efforts to obtain information about Jewish professors, staff and students at the University of Pennsylvania – including personal emails, phone numbers and home addresses – as government abuse with “ominous historical overtones”.</p>
<p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is demanding the university turn over names and personal information about Jewish members of the Penn community as part of the administration’s stated goal to combat antisemitism on campuses. But some Jewish faculty and staff have condemned the government’s demand as “a visceral threat to the safety of those who would find themselves identified because compiling and turning over to the government ‘lists of Jews’ conjures a terrifying history”, according to a press release put out by the groups’ lawyers.</p>

      <h1>US carbon pollution rose in 2025 in reversal of previous years’ reductions</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Study from research firm finds that US greenhouse gas emissions grew faster than economic activity last year</p>
<p>In a reversal from previous years’ pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of datacenters and cryptocurrency mining, and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by Donald Trump’s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.</p>

      <h1>The hidden hierarchy of tennis practice courts: ‘I was back in the park, smelling the weed’</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>The unwritten rule in professional tournaments? Do not hog the practice court. But as leading players testify – the reality is very different</p>
<p>On a cool Wednesday afternoon before the US Open last year, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev were busy fine-tuning their games in an intense practice set at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, semi-finalists in the mixed doubles tournament, were scheduled to take their place at the hour and the American pair duly arrived a couple of minutes before their allotted slot.</p>
<p>An amusing scene soon unfolded. Medvedev and Zverev were clearly desperate to continue playing for a little longer, but their court time had run out. The pair began to sheepishly deliberate over whether to attempt to play another game, even lining up on the baseline again, and they still occupied the court past the hour. Finally, they admitted defeat, allowing Collins and Harrison, who had been standing quietly on the sidelines, to begin.</p>

<p>As a potential reversal of a significant policy implemented just over a year ago, the Canadian government is reportedly in advanced talks with China to remove or significantly reduce the 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The reversal comes as Prime Minister Mark Carney looks to stabilize trade relations with Beijing while navigating an increasingly hostile trade war initiated by the Trump administration against… well, everyone.</p>

<p>The Tesla Cybertruck program is in shambles. The latest data indicate production is running at roughly 10% of its planned capacity. Meanwhile, the Ford F150 Lightning outsold the Tesla Cybertruck in 2025 and was then canceled for not selling enough.</p>
<p>Is this what is coming for the Cybertruck?</p>

<p>“Give the champ a stamp”.
That was the call from a board member at the Muhammad Ali Center, according to the legendary boxer’s widow, Lonnie Ali.
To her, it only made sense, given her late husband once joked that he should be turned into a postage stamp “because that’s the only way I’ll ever get licked.” Now, ten years after his death—and just two days shy of what would have been his 84th birthday—the man known as The Greatest is getting his wish.</p>

      <p>Ballot initiative, opposed by the ultra-wealthy, would levy one-time 5% tax on individuals worth more than $1bn</p>
<p>California’s governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>, renewed his pledge this week to fight a controversial plan to tax billionaires in the state. The proposed ballot measure, which could go to voters in November, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/billionaire-tax-california">gained public attention recently</a> amid heavy criticism and threats from tech moguls to leave the state.</p>
<p>In interviews with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/gavin-newsom-moves-neutralize-tax-billionaires-00723633">Politico</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/newsom-billionaire-tax-california.html">the New York Times</a> published on Monday, Newsom described his office’s efforts to kill the proposed billionaire tax and told the Times he would “do what I have to do to protect the state”. As a direct-to-voters ballot initiative, Newsom would not have the power to veto the tax if the proposal passed.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Issue dubbed ‘great unifier’ but Republicans and Democrats are instead jockeying for big tech’s financial favor</p>
<p>In late October, an unlikely coalition formed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/michigan-data-center-fight">fiercely oppose</a> controversial plans for more than a dozen Michigan datacenters – rightwing “Stop the Steal” activists joined forces with groups like the Democratic Socialists of America, and people of all political stripes in between.</p>
<p><a href="https://progressmichigan.org/2025/12/new-poll-majority-of-michiganders-opposed-to-controversial-data-centers/">Polling showed</a> just 28% of residents supported new datacenters, and, amid the furor, Dylan Wegela, a Michigan state congressman, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16122025/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-repeal-data-center-tax-incentives/">introduced a bill</a> to repeal datacenter tax credits. Despite an opportunity for what looked like an easy political win, the bill has few co-sponsors, is unlikely to move in the state house, and most datacenter plans are poised to be built.</p>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump said on social media that he is imposing a 25% tariff on goods from countries “doing business” with Iran in response to Iran's government imprisoning and killing protesters. The countries that buy Iranian oil include India, Turkey, and China. We'll also share predictions for December's consumer price index. Plus, could the biggest economic risk to the U.S. in the year ahead be the U.S. itself?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> There's mounting pressure on Grok — the AI chatbot that's part of Elon Musk's social media platform, X — over the generation of explicit images. The U.K. is rushing through a new law making it illegal to create nonconsensual intimate images; meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia have already blocked access to Grok. Then, the race is heating up to build the most powerful quantum computers. We visit one of the biggest players, Google's quantum lab in California.</p>

      <p>Since Trump retook office, protesters across the US are sending messages that are hard for drivers to miss</p>
<p>Bonnie Connery was horrified when she read the news about the death of ICE observer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good">Renee Nicole Good</a> in Minneapolis on 7 January. Within minutes, she and her local Missoula Visibility Brigade were messaging each other. By 3.30pm, the group of 20 was standing on the South Reserve Street Pedestrian Bridge, arranging letters cut out of craft paper and glued onto black foam and hanging them across the bridge using bungee cords. Thousands of cars driving by during rush hour passed under their messages: “ICE THUGS KILL CITIZEN” and “DHS LIES.”</p>
<p>The idea was to grab drivers’ attention quickly, which often means using a short, shocking message. When asked why the group chose this location, Connery said: “These cars are driving out of Missoula, which is blue, into the very red areas outside of the city.”</p>

      <h1>Jerome Powell: steely Fed chair standing firm in face of Trump’s threats</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Highly respected figure has cast off restrained approach in defending central bank from escalating attacks</p>
<p>There are often few surprises with Jerome Powell. At his handful of public appearances each month, the US Federal Reserve chair always sports the same softly stern expression. His voice, typically dispassionate and near-monotone, never wavers.</p>

      <h1>40 years on, did Proposition 48 protect US college sports – or punish Black athletes?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>When the NCAA tied eligibility to standardized test scores in 1986, hundreds of recruits were barred from competition. But its legacy is still a subject of debate</p>
<p>Tony Rice noticed the looks and smirks during his first week of freshman classes in the fall of 1986 at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>He had accepted his fate a few months earlier when standardized test results led to the decision that he would not be eligible to participate in collegiate sports his freshman year. But nothing prepared him for this.</p>

      <h1>AI is eating up the world's computing memory</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Much like graphics processing units, high bandwidth memory is essential for training and running AI.

Now the surge in demand from data centers has created a global shortage for everything else — the PCs and smartphones and other consumer electronics that also use memory chips. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Tom Mainelli, vice president of device and consumer research at IDC, about how long this shortage could last.</p>

<p>A suspect in an arson fire at a synagogue that was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan decades ago admitted to targeting the historic institution because it's a Jewish house of worship and confessed what he had done to his father, who turned him in to authorities after observing burn marks on his son's ankles, hands and face, the FBI said Monday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has sued the Pentagon over attempts to punish him for his warnings about illegal orders. He's claiming the Trump administration trampled on his constitutional rights to free speech. Kelly, a former Navy pilot who represents Arizona, is seeking to block his censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week. Hegseth said he censured Kelly over his participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders. A federal judge scheduled a hearing Thursday on Kelly's request for a temporary restraining order against the Pentagon.</p>

<p>In response to the news overnight that Donald Trump’s justice department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, the Senate banking committee’s top Democrat – <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> – has warned that her colleagues should not move forward with the president’s nominee for the role when Powell’s term expires at in May of this year.</p>
<p>Warren accused the president of wanting to “install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America’s central bank”.</p>
<p>Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.</p>
<p>This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 residents in the Texas border city of El Paso were left with little to no water after a main break over the weekend, and it was expected to take till midweek for operations to return to normal, officials said.</p>
<p>The break in the 36-inch water main line happened late Saturday night in El Paso, which has a population of about 700,000, officials said. Gilbert Trejo, an official with El Paso Water, called it “an event of unprecedented proportion”. He said the break was made even more impactful because of “the way the pipeline itself was designed along with how different connections of smaller lines were made to it”.</p>

      <h1>Mark Kelly sues Hegseth over ‘chilling’ effort to reduce military retirement rank</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>US defense secretary Pete Hegseth tried to reduce veteran’s pension for speaking out against Trump administration</p>
<p>Democratic US senator Mark Kelly filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to nullify the “chilling” attempt by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to reduce the military veteran’s rank and pension as punishment for speaking out against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>.</p>
<p>Hegseth had previously issued a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/pete-hegseth-censure-senator-mark-kelly">formal censure to Kelly</a>, a decorated retired navy captain and Nasa astronaut, for alleged “seditious statements” he made urging service members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/mark-kelly-troops-disobey-illegal-orders-comments">to resist unlawful orders</a>. It began a process that could lead to Kelly, a senator for Arizona since 2021, being demoted and having his pension cut.</p>

<p>The number two prosecutor in the US attorney’s office for the eastern district of Virginia has been fired, according to two people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of dismissals in an office that is leading controversial criminal prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James.</p>
<p>Robert McBride, a former federal prosecutor in Kentucky, was brought in late last year to serve as the deputy to Lindsey Halligan, a Trump ally who the president installed as the acting US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia in September. McBride was dismissed after declining to lead the Comey prosecution, which a judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed">threw out</a> in November after ruling Halligan was unlawfully appointed, one of the people said.

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump’s growing frustration with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to political independence reached fever pitch over the weekend when Fed Chair Jerome Powell annouced the DOJ has opened a criminal investigation into the Fed. Powell called the probe “unprecedented” and said the Fed uses data, not politics, to make interest rate decisions. In this episode, we get context on the situation from economist Julia Coronado — including how the investigation could have an impact on financial markets.</p>

<p>An early winter and more extreme weather have made road salt a hot commodity, with the early winter and harsher weather creating shortages, and many cities and communities adjusting their approach to de-icing roads and sidewalks. The world’s largest underground salt mine, which is in Goderich, Ont., says it's working round the clock to try to meet demand.</p>

      <h1>Trump annexation of Greenland ‘would be end of Nato’, says Chris Murphy</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)

      <p>Democrat also says president is ‘spending no time thinking about the actual crises’ like food aid and health costs</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/06/why-is-donald-trump-renewing-calls-for-takeover-of-greenland">threat to annex Greenland</a> represents an existential crisis for Nato, the senior Democratic US senator Chris Murphy has warned, with the demise of the decades-old alliance of western nations certain to follow any American military intervention.</p>
<p>“It would be the end of Nato, right? Nato would have an obligation to defend Greenland,” the Connecticut senator and member of the chamber’s foreign relations committee said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. Murphy added that it would mean “clearly … we would be at war with Europe, with England, with France”.</p>

      <h1>Trump regrets not seizing voting machines after 2020 election loss</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>President says he ‘should have’ used national guard to seize machines in support of false claim that election was rigged</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has said he regrets not getting the US national guard to seize voting machines after his 2020 election defeat ended his first presidency, as he continues to falsely claim that he won the race. But he has also questioned whether national guard troops would be “sophisticated enough” to pull something like that off.</p>
<p>Trump made those remarks in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/trump-voting-machines-2020-election.html">interview</a> with the New York Times published on Sunday. The outlet had questioned him about a plan reportedly floated in late 2020, after he lost that year’s presidential election to Joe Biden, to seize voting machines in several key swing states in an effort to search for evidence of fraud.</p>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Officially, the Federal Reserve is being investigated by the Justice Department over office building renovations. But in a video statement Sunday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the investigation, which includes a threat of criminal charges, is “a consequence” of the Fed maintaining its independence from President Trump. Plus, later in the episode, how the Warner Bros. deal could affect moviegoers — at home and in theaters.</p>

      <p>Journalists call on homeland security officials to reduce law-enforcement confrontations as tensions flare</p>
<p>After a year in which US journalists faced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/violence-against-journalists-increase-trump">dramatic increase</a> in violence from law enforcement, news organizations and advocacy groups have recently tried to better protect reporters through outreach to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Over the last four months, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a collection of New York news outlets have sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security attempting to open dialogue to reduce confrontations between law enforcement officers and journalists at protests, especially over efforts to deport alleged undocumented immigrants.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Party aims to turn tables after struggling to deal with criticisms about inflation during Biden presidency</p>
<p>In their quest to undo Donald Trump’s grip on voters, Democrats have staked their hopes on one word above all others: affordability.</p>
<p>It has become a staple of press conferences, a priority of candidates and a subject of legislation ahead of the November midterm elections. When Democrats don’t like something that Trump does – a frequent occurrence – their counter-argument is that Americans would have been better off if the president instead concentrated on making life less expensive.</p>

      <p>
      <p>On Jan. 7, 2025, the Eaton and Palisades Fires began, killing 31 people and destroying around 13,00 homes in the Los Angeles area. A year later, residents are looking to rebuild the lives and homes they once had.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s David Branccacio and his wife lost their Altadena home to the Eaton fire, and have yet to break ground on a new building. But as they continue to plan for construction in the new year, they are focusing on fire-resistance for the future.</p>
<p>Branccacio joined “Marketplace Tech” host Meghan McCarty Carino to speak about the technology and building that goes into fire-resistant homes.</p>

<p>Right now, the future of Greenland hangs in the balance.
And with it, an entire system of military and political alliances that has underpinned the global order since the end of the Second World War.
So when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he’s going to meet with Danish leaders to talk about Greenland this week, that’s what diplomats, historians and politicians the world over say is at stake.
This could have massive implications for Canada, both as a NATO member and target of Trump’s expansionist appetites.
Casey Michel joins us. He’s a journalist and author of the upcoming book ‘United States of Oligarchy’. He recently wrote a piece for Foreign Policy titled “Annexing Greenland would be a Strategic Catastrophe.”</p>

<p>Notre Dame have denied wrongdoing by Marcus Freeman after the school’s head football coach was accused of battery.</p>
<p>The South Bend Tribune reported on Sunday that Chris Fleeger, an assistant wrestling coach for New Prairie High School, had filed a police report over an incident at a meet on 3 January. According to the report, police and school officials had to separate the Freemans from Fleeger, as Freeman’s wife Joanna had a shouting match with the wrestling coach. Police did not disclose to the newspaper the extent of the contact that Fleeger alleges took place between him and the Fighting Irish coach.</p>

<p>A lot of mainstream auto media coverage right now is pushing the idea that some EVs are “dying.” What we’re <em>really</em> seeing is a wave of end-of-cycle, first-generation vehicles making way for their next-gen replacements. Historically, that’s when buyers get the best deals – so if that’s what <em>you’re</em> after, these are the EVs you should be looking at right now.</p>

<p>The German government has sharply rejected claims by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, that doctors in Germany have faced legal action for issuing vaccine and mask exemptions during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The statements made by the US secretary of health are completely unfounded, factually incorrect, and must be rejected,” Germany’s health minister, Nina Warken, said in a strongly worded statement released late on Saturday.</p>

<p>As long as range anxiety is still a thing, you could make the case that manufacturers posting huge range numbers between stops is only making it worse, convincing hesitant, late-adopters that range is the <em>only</em> stat that matters. That said, with 1600 km (~995 miles) of combined range, the new Buick Electra E7 is an impressive, bladder-busting ride.</p>

<p>Content creators and influencers in the US are now increasingly dominating requests for O-1 work visas. Astoundingly, the number of O-1 visas granted each year increased by 50% between 2014 and 2024, as noted by recent reporting in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8816fcec-4148-4cda-be7f-fc59d5bcbf59">Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>These visas allow non-immigrants to work temporarily in the US. The O-1 category includes the O-1A, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business or athletics and the O-1B, reserved for those with <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement">“extraordinary ability or achievement”</a>.</p>

<p>A few days before Christmas in Pérez Zeledón, a city in Costa Rica, Greidy Mata stared at two photographs of her late brother. In one image, Randall Gamboa Esquivel flashed a smile prior to his immigration to the United States a year before. In the second, he was lying in a hospital bed in a vegetative state, after being deported back home.</p>
<p>Dinner was served, but Mata seemed indifferent. She kept switching between one photograph and the other until she suddenly recounted that a year ago, in what would become the last family reunion, Gamboa announced he would be leaving for New Jersey.</p>

<p>The family of a Costa Rican man who was deported from the United States in a vegetative state and died shortly after arriving back in his home country is still urgently seeking answers from the authorities about what happened to him while he was in detention.</p>
<p>Randall Gamboa Esquivel had left Costa Rica in good health and crossed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border">United States-Mexico border</a> in December 2024, according to his family. However, Gamboa was detained by the US authorities for re-entering American soil unlawfully, as he had previously lived there undocumented between 2002 and 2013.</p>

      <p>Oil is US president’s motivation but his concept of economic success feels as outdated as his music tastes</p>
<p>The word “loot” entered the English language from Hindi in the late 18th century, as the rapacious East India Company plundered its way across the subcontinent.</p>
<p>It was a trading company, not a state – but it had the imprimatur of the English crown and its own large private army, mingling commerce and military force and opening the way for British imperial dominance of India.</p>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>In Philadelphia, protesters demanded ICE leave US communities and Trump end warmongering in Venezuela</p>
<p>On a rainy Saturday in Philadelphia, two separate protests, both with a few hundred people, marched from city hall to the federal detention center. They differed slightly in solutions as well as crowd makeup – white older adults dominated the morning’s march organized by the groups behind the No Kings protests, while a more racially diverse crowd swathed in keffiyehs and N95 face masks led the afternoon’s, planned by the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter. However, both groups shared a goal: for ICE to get out of American communities and to put an end to Donald Trump’s warmongering in Venezuela.</p>
<p>“From Venezuela to Minneapolis, all we’re seeing is a regime that is scrambling, willing to kill its own citizens, willing to kill foreign citizens, to maintain its power,” said Deborah Rose Hinchey, co-chair of the city’s Democratic Socialists of America chapter.</p>

<p>United States men’s national team striker Ricardo Pepi is expected to miss roughly two months after suffering a broken forearm while playing for PSV Eindhoven on Saturday, the Dutch club confirmed.</p>
<p>Pepi, 23, was injured after landing awkwardly after scoring PSV’s second goal during their Eredivisie match against Excelsior. Medical examinations carried out later that night at a hospital revealed a fracture, and the club said Pepi will undergo surgery on Sunday. PSV did not indicate any complications but ruled the striker out for the immediate future.</p>

<p>Authorities in Clay county, Mississippi, say a man has been taken into custody and charged with first-degree murder following the fatal shootings of six people, including a child, on Friday night.</p>
<p>Daricka Moore, 24, is accused of killing multiple relatives as well as a local pastor before his arrest, according to Clay county sheriff Eddie Scott, who addressed the case during a Saturday news conference. Officials said the charge against Moore, who lives in the county, is expected to be elevated to capital murder, and prosecutors could seek the death penalty if he is determined to be mentally competent.</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr delivered a blistering condemnation of the US federal government on Friday, criticizing official accounts of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis and praising the Minnesota Timberwolves for publicly acknowledging the woman’s death.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters before the Warriors’ game against the Sacramento Kings at Chase Center, Kerr said the response from federal authorities following Good’s killing by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent was “shameful”, accusing officials of misrepresenting events despite the existence of video footage and eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>Pacing inside the Kremlin last weekend, as news feeds churned out minute-by-minute reports of Donald’s Trump’s Venezuelan coup, Vladimir Putin may have been wondering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/05/russia-weighs-up-fall-of-nicolas-maduro-venezuela">what it would mean for the price of oil</a>.</p>
<p>Crude oil has lubricated the Russian economy for decades – far more than gas exports to Europe – and so the threat of falling oil prices, prompted by US plans for control of Venezuela’s rigs, will have been a source of concern.</p>

(date: 2026-01-10)
      <p>
      <p>Funding was paused because health department said benefits were going to people in country illegally</p>
<p>A federal judge ruled on Friday that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> cannot block federal money for childcare subsidies and other programs aimed at supporting low-income families with children from flowing to five Democratic-led states for now.</p>
<p>The states of California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York argued that a policy announced on Tuesday to freeze billions of dollars in funds for three grant programs was having an immediate impact on them and creating “operational chaos”. In court filings and a hearing earlier on Friday, the states contended that the government did not have a legal reason for withholding the money from them.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors claim Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, started a smaller wildfire that went on to become the devastating Palisades blaze. Is he ultimately to blame?</p>
<p>More than a year after a devastating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires">wildfire</a> tore through Pacific Palisades, all but obliterating one of the west coast’s most iconic neighborhoods, prosecutors are honing their case against the man they say is responsible.</p>
<p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old occasional Uber driver who used to live in Pacific Palisades, was charged with three felonies by federal prosecutors in October, who claim he was in the neighborhood in the early hours of New Year’s Day. According to <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-criminal-complaint.pdf">a federal complaint</a>, Rinderknecht allegedly used an open flame – likely a lighter – to start a small blaze that grew to about 8 acres (3.2 hectares) before firefighters rushed to the area and extinguished it.</p>

      <p>State and local officials say they do not believe investigation into shooting death of Renee Nicole Good will be objective</p>
<p>State and local leaders say they do not believe that the FBI investigation of the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good will be fair and impartial, and are sounding alarms about the impact of federal officials holding onto evidence in a potential prosecution of the ICE agent who killed her.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s lead investigative agency, the bureau of criminal apprehension, initially began investigating the shooting in conjunction with the FBI. But the BCA issued a statement Thursday morning saying that “the US attorney’s office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation”.</p>

      <p>Blocking immigration will not make Trump’s America great again – for the US to shine, he must let it get browner</p>

<p>However many immigrants he manages to deport or prevent from entering the country, the white paradise he is promising his Maga base, free of Somalis, Mexican “rapists” and generally people from “shithole countries” – closer in hue to the America where he was born – is not his to offer.</p>

<p><strong>Pope Leo XIV has denounced how nations are using force to assert their dominion worldwide, saying they are “completely undermining” peace and the post-Second World War international legal order, AP reported.</strong></p>
<p>In his most substantial critique of US, Russian and other military incursions in sovereign countries, Leo told ambassadors who represent their countries’ interests at the Holy See that “war is back in vogue and a zeal for war is spreading”.</p>

      <h1>Trump repeats baseless claim that Renee Good was part of ‘leftwing network’ of paid agitators</h1>

(date: 2026-01-10)
      <p>
      <p>President’s assertion that only a paid agitator would scream at ICE agents contradicted by hundreds of video records</p>
<p>At the White House on Friday, Donald Trump endorsed his vice-president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/jd-vance-ice-agent-killing-minneapolis-trump">baseless claim</a> that Renee Good, the 37-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota-ice-shooting">woman killed by an ICE agent</a> in Minneapolis on Wednesday, was part of a shadowy “leftwing network” trying “to incite violence” against federal agents.</p>
<p>Asked by a Fox News correspondent to expand on JD Vance’s comments about Good, the president said that the vice-president “is generally very accurate” and then cited what he referred to as evidence that at least one person in Good’s vicinity when she was killed was “probably a paid agitator”.</p>

<p>Six protesters were arrested by police in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/portland">Portland, Oregon</a>, late on Thursday, as an appeal for calm from local leaders largely held despite growing outrage over federal immigration enforcement in the city after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/portland-federal-agents-shooting">two people were shot</a> by US border patrol agents.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, dozens of protesters gathered again outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, holding signs that denounced ICE agents as “thugs” and “Nazis”.</p>

<p>Federal immigration officers are pulling out of a Louisiana crackdown and heading to Minneapolis in an abrupt pivot from an operation that drew protests around New Orleans and aimed to make thousands of arrests, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The shift appeared to signal a wind-down of the Louisiana deployment that was dubbed “Catahoula Crunch” and began in December with the arrival of more than 200 officers. The operation had been expected to last into February and swiftly raised fears in immigrant communities.</p>

<p>Renee Nicole Good calmly said everything was “fine” and “I’m not mad at you” seconds before an on-duty Immigration Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot her in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> as she drove away, according to a cellphone video shared on Friday by Donald Trump’s White House.</p>

<p>The Washington National Opera (WNO) announced on Friday it is moving its performances out of the John F Kennedy Center, in what could be one of the most significant departures from the institution since Trump took control of it.</p>
<p>“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” the opera said in a statement to the New York Times. A separate <a href="https://washnatopera.org/">website</a> appears to be set up for the opera.</p>

<p>Free agent outfielder Max Kepler has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance, Major League Baseball announced on Friday, a ruling that sidelines the veteran as he looks for his next club.</p>
<p>The suspension stems from a positive test for epitrenbolone, a metabolite of the prohibited steroid trenbolone prohibited under MLB’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The ban takes effect immediately and would apply if Kepler signs with a team during the 2026 season.</p>

      <p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Tesla-Optimus-xAI.png?w=1600" alt=""></p>
<p>In a move that completely undermines the “Tesla is an AI company” narrative, Elon Musk’s private startup, xAI, has reportedly told investors that it plans to build the AI to power Tesla’s Optimus robot.</p>
<p>This new development comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus">Bloomberg report</a> detailing xAI’s widening losses and massive cash burn. According to the report, xAI executives explicitly told investors that their goal is to “develop self-sufficient AI to power robots like Tesla’s Optimus.”</p>
<p>This is a massive shift in the narrative and potentially the smoking gun in ongoing shareholder lawsuits regarding Musk’s breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

      <h1>How independent journalism is a form of resistance: ‘I’m not answering to anyone’</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s attacks on mainstream media have opened a window for journalists who want to operate independently</p>
<p>When Donald Trump retook office last January, many national newsrooms braced for what lay ahead. There was the expected firehose of news, with the president issuing <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025">dozens of executive orders</a> in his first week alone. Then there was the fear and tension over the president’s history of attacking and suing <a href="https://firstamendmentwatch.org/tag/trump-suing-for-defamation/">news organizations over unfavorable coverage</a>. Meanwhile, audience <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx">trust in media</a> was at an all-time low.</p>
<p>While it was a turbulent time for traditional media, it opened a window for independent journalists like Marisa Kabas, who is not beholden to covering Trump’s every move, nor saddled with decades of institutional distrust. On 27 January, she received a massive scoop she published in her newsletter, <a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop">the Handbasket</a>: the US office of management and budget was freezing federal grants. Getting to that news first only led to more exclusives and subscribers.</p>

<p>Witnesses to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday say federal officers impeded the response of emergency medical personnel to the scene, blocking the road with their vehicles.</p>
<p>Emily Heller, a witness who lives near the intersection of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, recorded the scene as it unfolded. She told NBC News that agents blocked people from approaching Good’s vehicle. Her video shows a man who identified himself as a physician asking to check for a pulse and being rebuffed.</p>

      <h1>Bytes: Week in Review – New year, new state AI laws, new showdown with Trump admin.</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>X, formerly Twitter, is facing a global backlash because users are directing the platform's AI chatbot, Grok, to generate non-consensual intimate imagery. Users have been popping up in the replies of women — and sometimes minors — tagging Grok and asking it to generate images of them in bikinis or undressed.</p>
<p>The company and its owner, Elon Musk, have both clarified illegal content will not be tolerated on the platform.</p>
<p>Plus, President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last year aimed at blocking states from enforcing local AI regulations — something a majority have adopted in some form.</p>
<p>And, Meta is a victim of its own success. Its new Ray-Ban smart glasses are selling too fast to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Maria Curi, tech policy reporter at Axios, to discuss all these topics on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

But a torrent of untruths, half-truths, smears and innuendo has been unleashed by the White House, and amplified by its social media and cable television acolytes, in an attempt to douse the flames.</p>
<p>Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a “stone cold liar” on Thursday for her efforts to falsely portray the victim, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good">Renee Nicole Good</a>, a 37-year-old mother of three and award-winning poet, as a “domestic terrorist”.</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff predictions: who will seize a wide-open Super Bowl race?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>The postseason kicks off on Saturday. Our writers pick the dark horses, players to watch and make their tips for the NFL’s championship game</p>
<p>Melissa is right about the Lions (see below), but how about the <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong>? Their defense was nauseating, and nobody wants a playoff weekend spoiled watching that. But their offense was electric. They finished fifth in the league in EPA/play in the regular season. And with Dak Prescott, a solid o-line and George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb, they had the potential to drop 30 points on any playoff group. If they’d snuck in and managed to knock off a top seed, it would have convinced Jerry Jones that he was on the right path. And nothing is funnier than Jones failing to recognize that the reason why Dallas is stuck is the reflection in his mirror. <strong>Oliver Connolly</strong></p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Labor economists will tell ya, productivity growth leads to more hiring. The idea is, once a company is operating more efficiently, they’ll try expanding, which usually comes with new jobs. But in this frustrating and bizarre economy, data show major productivity gains and a stagnant labor market … coexisting? Also in this episode: New York City expands a free child care program, one reporter tries to do the job(s) of the federal government, and economists expect a less-grim December jobs report.</p>

<p>The ICE agent involved in the lethal shooting of 37-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good">Renee Nicole Good</a> during an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/minnesota-immigration-agents-trump">immigration sweep</a> in Minneapolis on Wednesday is Jonathan E Ross, according to court records that closely match the description of a June 2025 incident involving the agent in Bloomington, Minnesota, cited by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, and JD Vance. Ross is a Minneapolis resident and 10-year veteran of the special response team of ICE’s enforcement and removal operation.</p>
<p>The death of Good, a mother of three, sparked outrage in Minneapolis and strident rebukes from Minnesota officials and on Capitol Hill. Thousands of people gathered in protest near the site of the shooting Wednesday night, and some Democrats on Capitol Hill have threatened to withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security. Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, said on Wednesday: “To ICE: get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”</p>

<p>Kim, the dominant force in women’s halfpipe snowboarding for nearly a decade, revealed the injury on Thursday, sharing video of the fall that caused the scare. The injury occured while Kim was training in Laax, a regular World Cup venue and a key pre-Olympic stop on the circuit. The 25-year-old landed a maneuver cleanly but lost her edge shortly afterward, sliding awkwardly across the pipe and into the wall.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/news/bca/bca-statement-regarding-investigation-ice-fatal-shooting-minneapolis">statement</a>, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it was initially called upon to help investigate the shooting before federal officials “reversed course” and said the case would be “solely led by the FBI”.

<p>For months, we have been reporting on the demand issues Tesla is facing in Europe. Now, the situation has deteriorated to a point where the existence of Gigafactory Berlin itself seems to be in question.</p>

      <h1>Elon Musk moves goalpost again: admits Tesla needs 10 billion miles for ‘safe unsupervised’ FSD</h1>

<p>We are barely a week into 2026, and we are already seeing a significant shift in the narrative regarding Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) timeline. After missing yet another high-profile deadline to achieve unsupervised autonomy by the “end of the year” in 2025, Elon Musk has now dropped a new metric that explains a lot — and raises even more questions.</p>
<p>In a new comment today, Musk has stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly <strong>10 billion miles</strong> of data to achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”</p>
<p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-10.06.32-AM.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>The new statement raises the question: why did Musk claim that Tesla would be unsupervised in Austin just a few weeks ago, when he knew that Tesla was nowhere near 10 billion miles?</p>

      <h1>US protester arrested after TV interview says she was targeted due to Venezuela trip</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Jessica Plichta faces misdemeanor charges, which locals say is a tactic of Grand Rapids, Michigan, police to suppress protests</p>
<p>Jessica Plichta was arrested on 3 January after a live interview with a <a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/protesters-professor-react-to-us-strikes-venezuela-capture-president/69-2a8c465c-17d1-48d3-adb5-541c8f757ad9">local news station</a> about a Grand Rapids, Michigan, protest against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s president, in an attack with a reported death toll of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/07/europe-greenland-denmark-us-france-trade-weather-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-695f0c0d8f08e0dc61f227d9#block-695f0c0d8f08e0dc61f227d9">100</a>. The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. While the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-critic-arrested-on-camera-after-speaking-out-against-maduro-venezuela-capture/">headlines</a> focused on Plichta’s age (22) and that she’s a preschool teacher, Plichta believes the reason for her arrest – seemingly the only one among roughly 200 protesters – went beyond the day’s events.</p>
<p>Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday’s protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration’s blockade. She was a part of a delegation to the International People’s Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas. Activists from dozens of groups planned to attend. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/29/trump-venezuelan-airspace-military-00670743">“closed in its entirety” on 29 November</a>, many canceled their trips.</p>

      <h1>Senators claim UnitedHealth is withholding internal documents from inquiry</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>UnitedHealth says it will ‘continue to engage’ with lawmakers who began investigating their involvement in nursing home care after Guardian investigation</p>
<p>UnitedHealth has refused to hand over key internal records to lawmakers investigating the company’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/unitedhealth-nursing-homes">efforts to reduce hospital transfers</a> for nursing home residents, according to a 7 January letter sent to the company by the US senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>The veteran lawmakers, both members of the powerful Senate finance committee, launched their inquiry last summer following a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/unitedhealth-nursing-homes-payments-hospital-transfers">Guardian investigation</a> into bonuses that UnitedHealth pays to nursing homes that reduce hospital transfers for their residents. Those are hospitalizations the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions from the Guardian about the senators’ assertion that the company had failed to turn over internal documents. But it said in a statement that it will “continue to engage” with the senators and that its nursing home care program “improves outcomes” and “reduces unnecessary hospitalizations”.</p>

      <h1>US is 'gradually turning away' from its allies, Macron says – video</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday the US was 'breaking free from international rules, which it promoted until recently, whether it be trade, certain security matters or some forums'.</p>
<p>His comments came after Donald Trump ordered a military attack on Venezuela in which the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured. The US president has since renewed his call for the US to seize Greenland, a Danish territory – a move that would threaten European security and could mean the end of Nato</p>

<p>The bill, dubbed the “Securing Accessible Functional Emergency (SAFE) Exit Act,” aims to force automakers to install easy-to-find manual releases in case of power failure.</p>

      <h1>US actions in Venezuela put the 2026 World Cup in disgraceful company | Leander Schaerlaeckens</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>In 1934 and 1978, Fifa’s big event was given over to authoritarian aims. There’s no more doubt that 2026 will be the same</p>
<p>By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini">managing it with a heavy hand</a> and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.</p>
<p>It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla">systematic detention, torture and murder</a>. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.</p>
<p><em>Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12. You can <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/722130/the-long-game-by-leander-schaerlaeckens/">preorder it here</a>. He teaches at Marist University.</em></p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>President Gustavo Petro announced on Wednesday that he had agreed to meet Donald Trump after calling for Colombians to take to the streets in a 'day of national mobilisation' against the US president's military threats. Anger mounted in Colombia after the US intervention in Venezuela and the capture of Nicolás Maduro last week. On Sunday, when asked if there would be a US operation in Colombia, Trump replied: 'Sounds good to me. You know why? Because they kill a lot of people.'</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s sudden decision to freeze $10bn worth of federal funding for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/childcare">childcare</a> and needy families has not only already thrown the US childcare system into mass confusion, but could also lead to disaster for hundreds of thousands of families within weeks, experts say.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced late on Tuesday it would block California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York from drawing down money from three major social safety programs over “serious concerns about widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in state-administered programs”. In order to access the funding, the Democratic-run states must provide the Trump administration with extensive documentation to allay the fears of fraud.</p>

      <p>Advocates suing to reverse administration’s surcharge system that has led to passport checks and angry visitors</p>
<p>A new $100 fee for foreign tourists entering US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/national-parks">national parks</a> has triggered chaos and frustrating waits, with staff reporting long entry lines as citizenship checks are made and irate visitors regularly ditching plans to patronize some of America’s most cherished landscapes.</p>
<p>The new fee system, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/national-park-fee-non-residents">introduced</a> by the Trump administration from 1 January, has caught many visitors and National Park Service (NPS) staff off-guard, with checks now having to be undertaken to assess nationality and tourists often turning away from entrances rather than pay the surcharge. The Guardian heard accounts of problems from several NPS staff, speaking anonymously, who work at different parks across the country.</p>

<p>The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than <span class="math inline">\(56 a barrel today to about \)</span>50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials.</p>

<p>He jumped into his car to head to the scene. Torres DeSantiago manages the Immigrant Defense Network, a group that monitors ICE activity and responds to community needs after someone is taken. He has responded to dozens of scenes in the past few months, and even more in the last few days since the federal government surged its presence in the midwestern city.</p>

<p>Beijing reported cleaner air than ever in 2025, with 311 days of good or moderate air quality. It’s largely thanks to strict emissions regulations and the growth of electric cars in Chinese cities.</p>

      <h1>With Venezuela, Trump has achieved his dream of making his own 80s action movie</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Given his rise during the ego joyride of the 1980s, it’s no shock that Trump’s foreign policy is to emulate that decade’s belligerent cinema</p>
<p>The box office barnstormer of 2026 arrived early this year. A sleazy banana-republic dictator flooding the American streets with blow. The over-the-border Delta Force extraction squad sent to pluck this schmo out of his impregnable fortress. The bronzed tough-talker who’s firing an RPG up the tailpipe of the international rules-based order – but who gets the job done. Call it: Caracas Thunder.</p>
<p>Sounds like a bit of a throwback, you might be thinking. But, judging by his press conference after the US military’s abduction of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, Donald Trump seemed to have finally achieved his dream of directing his own 80s action movie.</p>

      <p>For the past couple months, YouTube technologist Benn Jordan has been investigating Flock Safety surveillance cameras. With the help of 404 Media, they found that many of these cameras were not only tracking, zooming and following every passerby, but the footage was freely accessible on the internet.</p>
<p>Jordan joined Marketplace Tech host Meghan McCarty Carino to talk about how he found the footage and the dangers the surveillance system poses to privacy and other civil liberties. Remember, Big Brother is always watching.</p>

<p>Exports to the U.S. slumped in October to their lowest level outside of the pandemic since 1997, while exports to countries other than the U.S. jumped in the same month. The shift comes after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on much of the world.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue rulings on Friday but, as is customary, has not said what case or cases will be acted upon.

      <p>The postseason consistently serves up enthralling football. But there are ways to make it even more compelling</p>
<p>No legitimate Super Bowl champion should have a losing record in the regular season. The Panthers, crowned NFC South champions at 8-9, are not an outlier. Since 2010, five teams with losing records have made the postseason. The 2022 Bucs were the first team to make the dance with a losing record since the league instituted a 17-game schedule. This season, the NFC South has done it again.</p>

      <p>A federal enforcement operation ended with a woman dead and the facts contested. The NBA cannot treat state violence in a residential neighborhood as background noise</p>
<p>The SUV sat motionless against a tree on a south Minneapolis street, its engine quiet, angled as if it had simply run out of gas. Except the windshield bore a small shattered star, delicate and sharp, like a snowflake pressed into glass. Cold Minnesota air leaked through the fracture, settling over the still body inside. The car became a sealed room, a thin shell holding death in place, surrounded <a href="https://x.com/adamemedia/status/2009038936396509522?s=46">by the stuffed animals</a> of the woman’s children.</p>
<p>In the street, witnesses screamed. Not in words, but in sounds that come before language, as reality breaks faster than thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the UK, <strong>Nigel Farage has offered his take on Trump’s plans to control Greenland, saying it would be “outrageous” for the US to seize it from Denmark.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Farage</strong> says he agrees with Starmer that the fate of Greenland must be decided by Greenland and Denmark, not the US – but sided with Trump on “some genuine security concerns” that require further presence there.</p>
<p><em>“What I will say is this. <strong>There are some genuine security concerns around Greenland</strong> and that becomes ever more relevant with a retraction of the ice caps as we head towards the North Pole. There is a strong feeling in British intelligence circles, and many in Nato, that <strong>there needs to be a significant Nato base located directly on the north of Greenland.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>At the moment, <strong>it would appear that is something Greenland is not particularly keen to do.</strong></em></p>

<p>According to Donald Trump, it was a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5159868/2024-election-trump-harris-capitol-riot">day of love</a>. For those who watched the violent insurrection on January 6, and for the more than 140 law enforcement officers injured that day, it didn’t seem like there was much love on show.</p>
<p>Live video footage showed scores of Trump supporters smashing windows, beating police officers and scrambling over each other as they broke into the Capitol building, in an attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. “The most shameful day in American history,” Guardian writer Robert Reich called it.</p>

<p>CES 2026 in Las Vegas has been dominated by two things: the next generation of AI compute and a sudden explosion of credible humanoid robots.</p>
<p>While Tesla isn’t officially exhibiting on the floor, Elon Musk has been actively monitoring the event from X. His reactions, and lack thereof, to the major announcements give us a fascinating look into how Tesla views the rapidly crowding field of autonomy.</p>
<p>Musk was quick to comment on NVIDIA’s major push into embedded AI for autonomous systems, but he has been noticeably quiet regarding the masterclass put on by Hyundai and Boston Dynamics.</p>

<p>Thunder Bay has long been known as a hockey hotbed, sending dozens of local players to the National Hockey League, and even a pair of players to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Yet, when it comes to the annual World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Thunder Bay’s representation is comparatively low. This year’s tournament marked the second World Juniors selection for Thunder Bay’s Carter George, whose selection in last year’s event marked the first time a player from the city was selected since Mackenzie Blackwood in 2016.</p>

<p>A new player in the electric transit space, Quebec-based Letenda, is trying to solve a problem that has plagued the transition to electric buses in North America: the “missing middle.” While we have seen plenty of full-size 40-foot electric buses and smaller shuttles, the 30-foot “midibus” market has been largely underserved.</p>
<p>Letenda thinks they have the answer with the “Electrip,” a ground-up design that focuses heavily on winter efficiency and a modular build.</p>

Driven by strong winds through parched vegetation, multiple fires exploded in quick succession last January, and devoured roughly 16,000 structures on all sides of LA.</p>
<p>Thirty-one lives were lost and thousands more were for ever changed. For many, a new chapter of the disaster began to unfold when the flames were extinguished, while the slow road to recovery started to take shape in the year that followed.</p>

<p>The child care and development fund subsidizes day care for low-income households, enabling parents to work or go to school.</p>
<p>Temporary assistance for needy families provides cash assistance and job training so parents in poverty can afford diapers and clothes and earn paychecks.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In Vallejo, California, ‘trad sons’ report feeling trapped by family obligations, slim job prospects and the fear of violence – leaving little room for romance</p>
<p>Are boys becoming men later? In recent decades, the markers of adulthood have shifted for young American men: they are almost twice as likely to be <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/">single</a>, less likely to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/12/18/fewer-young-men-are-in-college-especially-at-4-year-schools/">go to college</a> and more likely to be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-men-are-more-unemployed-than-women-healthcare-tech-2025-8">unemployed</a>. Most significantly for their parents, they are also less likely to have fled the nest, with the term “ <a href="https://people.com/what-is-a-trad-son-11836688">trad son</a>” springing into social media lexicon in recent months. In the 1970s, only 8% of Americans aged 25 to 34 were living with their parents, but by 2023, that figure had jumped to 18%, with men more likely to live at home than women, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/04/17/the-shares-of-young-adults-living-with-parents-vary-widely-across-the-us/">Pew survey</a>.</p>
<p>But not everywhere in the US has the same rates of adults living in their familial home. The living arrangement is least common in the midwest and most common in the north-east. Topping the list was Vallejo, where 33% of young adults live with their parents. How were they making it work?</p>

      <p>A survey released in the fall finds that most people displaced by the Southern California wildfires a year ago are still living in temporary housing. Since so few homes have been rebuilt, how are people paying for shelter? Today, we'll hear how survivors have organized to demand accountability and the resources needed. Plus, a semiconductor chip shortage echoes the great supply chain crisis of 2020, but this time it's driven by AI.</p>

<p>European leaders have sounded the alarm over Donald Trump’s ambitions to take over Greenland, but the U.S. president may instead be thinking of his legacy. If that’s the case, many analysts, diplomats and politicians believe not only will European diplomacy fail, but the entire post-Second World War system of alliances will come crashing down alongside it, should the U.S. move unilaterally.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> One of Europe's busiest airports has canceled more than 700 flights today as a disruption caused by snow and ice enters a sixth day. The problem was made worse because of a shortage of anti-freeze for de-icing planes at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Dutch airline KLM is the main one affected. Then, China's Foreign Ministry calls President Donald Trump's demands for Venezuelan oil &quot;typical bullying&quot; from the U.S.</p>

      <h1>White House says using US military ‘always an option’ for acquiring Greenland | First Thing</h1>

      <p>Trump demands Venezuela open up to US oil companies or risk more military action. Plus, justice department has released less than 1% of Epstein files</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military">an effort to acquire Greenland</a>, noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.</p>
<p><strong>How are the US’s European allies responding?</strong> In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.</p>
<p><strong>What would a deal of this kind signify?</strong> Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment">open up</a> to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.</p>

<p>The bombshell announcement that the Trump administration no longer fully recommends <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations">a third of childhood vaccines</a> means the US moved from leading globally on vaccination to lagging behind other high-income nations in preventing disease, experts say.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This summer’s tournament is seen as a culmination, but in truth it’s the next World Cup where the USMNT may have the most success</p>
<p>When the US was confirmed as a future World Cup co-host on the eve of the 2018 tournament in Russia, the USMNT were still stuck under the rubble of their shocking failure to qualify. Mauricio Pochettino was just establishing himself among European club soccer’s managerial elite, taking Tottenham to the Champions League final a year later.</p>
<p>Few could have imagined that he’d be leading the USMNT into the 2026 World Cup, and perhaps fewer believe he’ll stick around for the next cycle. Nevertheless, after a 2-1 win over Australia in Commerce City, Colorado to end the October window, Pochettino noted he’s building a team with 2030 in mind, too.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's board has unanimously turned down Paramount Skydance's latest attempt to acquire the studio, saying its revised $108.4-billion US hostile bid amounted to a risky leveraged buyout that investors should reject. The board repeated their commitment to Netflix's offer, which they say offers more value and certainty.</p>

<p>Pilots can’t see it coming, and it’s hard to avoid. But severe clear-air turbulence can shake a plane ‘like King Kong.’ It’s on the rise, and forecast to get worse due to climate change. The rise has researchers investigating how to better predict clear-air turbulence, and looking to the physics of birds to make this chaotic force less dangerous.</p>

      <p>European leaders push back forcefully against US president’s desire to seek takeover of Arctic territory</p>
<p>Donald Trump and his advisers are looking into “a range of options” in an effort to acquire Greenland, noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.</p>
<p>“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

      <p>This year, amid ongoing economic uncertainty, corporations are expected to refinance old debt, invest in artificial intelligence, and prep for mergers and acquisitions. All of which require extra cash. And how do corporations stretch their budgets? By taking on more debt, of course.

<p>The Baltimore Ravens have fired head coach John Harbaugh after 18 seasons in charge, the team announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Harbaugh is the most successful coach in the history of the franchise and was the second longest-tenured head coach in the NFL before his dismissal. Ironically, his final game with the Ravens came against the only name ahead of him in terms of tenure length – Mike Tomlin, who has been head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers for 19 seasons.</p>

      <p>

<p>In a setback for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pesticides">pesticide</a> industry, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> have succeeded in removing a rider from a congressional <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy26-interior%2C-environment%2C-and-related-agencies-bill-text.pdf">appropriations bill</a> that would have helped protect pesticide makers from being sued and could have hindered state efforts to warn about pesticide risks.</p>
<p>Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine and ranking member of the House appropriations interior, environment, and related agencies subcommittee, said Monday that the controversial measure pushed by the agrochemical giant Bayer and industry allies has been stripped from the 2026 funding bill.</p>

      <h1>In KemiWorld, might makes right. Just don’t mention Greenland | John Crace</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>In an interview with Nick Robinson, the Tory leader made it clear she was thrilled to see the back of international law. May the best country win!</p>
<p>These weren’t exactly the words Kemi Badenoch had been hoping to hear. Halfway through her interview on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, the BBC presenter Nick Robinson observed that, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/maduro-pleads-not-guilty">in regard to the US coup in Venezuela</a>, the Conservative leader’s position wasn’t that far off from Keir Starmer’s. You could sense the air go out of the room. In KemiWorld there is no greater dishonour than a likeness to the prime minister. Time for the fightback to begin. To create some distance.</p>
<p>OK, Kemi said. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/06/stephen-miller-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland">Yes, she too drew the line at Greenland</a>. That would be a step too far. There was no need for Donald Trump to claim the country for America. That was an action that could threaten Nato. And besides, as far as she knew, Greenland wasn’t a rogue narco state. She, too believed in a world of moral relativism. One where it was fine to invade countries whose regimes we disliked. There was one rule for the west and another for the rest.</p>

Achieving the president’s dream of supercharging the country’s oil production would be financially challenging – and if fulfilled, would be “terrible for the climate”, experts say.</p>
<p>Trump has aggressively sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/22/trump-big-oil-energy-priorities-explained">boost oil and gas production</a> within the US. Now, after the capture and arrest of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, he is seeking to orchestrate a ramp-up of drilling in Venezuela, which has the largest known reserves of oil in the world – equivalent to about 300bn barrels, <a href="https://knowledge.energyinst.org/search/record?id=58930">according to</a> research firm the Energy Institute.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Revelation comes as a first-in-the-nation citizen’s ballot initiative to ban donations by utilities picks up steam</p>
<p>An investigation into Michigan election records has found a major loophole in reporting laws that makes it difficult to track when and how campaign contributions move between lawmakers and the state’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/michigan-covid-lockdown-dte-energy">controversial</a> utilities, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy.</p>
<p>State law does not require the date that a contributor makes a donation to match the date that a campaign committee reports receiving it. That has created a scenario in which utilities throughout 2025 have cut checks for lawmakers around the time of controversial votes, but the lawmakers sometimes still have not reported receiving the contribution or report it much later.</p>

<p>Deep under London’s streets, thousands of miles from Caracas, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro’s</a> seizure by the US has reopened a multibillion-dollar question: who controls Venezuela’s gold reserves at the Bank of England?</p>
<p>After the ousting of Maduro, global attention has largely focused on the South American country’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play">vast oil wealth</a> – believed to be the largest reserves of any nation in the world. However, Venezuela also has significant gold holdings – including bullion worth at least $1.95bn (£1.4bn) frozen in Britain.</p>

<p>E-bike theft is one of those problems that never really goes away. Those of us <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/20/i-just-had-another-expensive-electric-bike-stolen-heres-what-would-have-stopped-it/">who have been victims</a> of it will never really forget that feeling. Of course, good locks can help, and GPS trackers might assist in getting a stolen bike back. But once a bike is stolen, the real incentive for thieves is simple: resale. And that’s exactly the problem Bosch is aiming to tackle with a new software update unveiled at CES 2026.</p>

<p>Nvidia (NVDA) held its CES 2026 keynote today, and as expected, Jensen Huang dropped a massive amount of news on the autonomous driving front. The biggest takeaway? Nvidia is moving beyond just “perceiving” the road to “reasoning” about it with a new family of open-source models called <strong>Alpamayo</strong>, which will power new autonomous and driver-assistance features.</p>
<p>Starting with Mercedes-Benz as soon as this quarter.</p>

      <h1>Markets shrug off U.S. capture of Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>

In this episode, markets are largely unmoved by Trump’s military intervention. Plus: Experts say jobs data is most important for predicting where the economy is headed, and Landon Derentz at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center gives context to Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on its recent criticism of Europe, saying last month’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe">US national security strategy</a> was an attempt to “jolt” an ally back to economic life.</p>
<p>The document was widely condemned in Europe as representing a seismic shift in the 70-year transatlantic alliance with its dark references to a purported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/trump-europe-national-security-strategy">threat of “civilisational erasure”</a> with migration and censorship creating “strife”, “cratering birthrates” and “loss of national identities”.</p>

      <p>The US might aim to unlock the country’s reserves, but cost and political uncertainty make it look an uncertain option</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The theory sounds straightforward. Venezuela <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play">has vast oil reserves</a> and used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now. Therefore it should be a simple matter to upgrade the crumbling kit with an injection of dollars and watch the extra barrels and profits flow.</p>
<p>That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.</p>

<p>Five Stanford University students are facing trial beginning on Monday over felony charges stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest on campus – the most severe criminal case brought against some of the thousands of students who staged nationwide protests and encampments against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The northern California students are part of a group of 12 who were charged with felony conspiracy to trespass and felony vandalism in connection to an hour-long, June 2024 occupation during which the group barricaded themselves inside the university president’s office to demand Stanford consider a student resolution to divest from Israel, among other requests.</p>

<p>Clustered along the US Gulf coast are some of the largest and most complex heavy-oil refineries in the world. These sprawling industrial hubs, owned by major US oil companies, stand ready to emerge as some of the major victors of Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/why-trump-us-attacked-caracas-captured-venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro">swoop on Venezuela</a>.</p>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>Investors see some oil companies as big winners with the U.S. forcing a change of leadership in Venezuela. This morning, we'll hear how U.S. oil companies are faring in light of the news. Then, we'll provide some context for oil production and chat about global demand, what it'd take to develop Venezuela's infrastructure to help spark production, and learn how long it would take for U.S. oil companies to be reimbursed for investments.</p>

      <p>António Guterres concerned by ‘possible intensification of instability’ of Venezuela; ousted president arrives at a Manhattan courthouse where the full list of charges will be read</p>
<p>A UK minister would not be drawn into saying whether his government believes the US capture of Venezuela’s president was influenced by <strong>the country’s rich oil reserves</strong>.</p>
<p>Asked on Sky News why he thought Donald Trump had captured <strong>Nicolás Maduro</strong> and said America would “run” Venezuela, Home Office minister <strong>Mike Tapp</strong> said:</p>
<p><em><strong>This is for Donald Trump to answer</strong>, and I think he has said in his press conference, which I watched with interest around narco-terrorism and that threat.</em></p>

<p>If you’ve spent enough time riding electric bikes, you quickly realize that power is only part of the draw. Another big part is sound – or more accurately, the lack of it. A smooth, quiet motor can make an e-bike feel refined and premium, while a buzzy, rattly drivetrain can cheapen the experience no matter how strong the specs look on paper.</p>
<p>That’s something Bafang, one of the world’s largest e-bike motor manufacturers, says it has been focusing on for years. And after <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/i-went-back-to-bafangs-factory-in-china-five-years-later-the-difference-is-mindblowing/">I took a trip inside their motor testing grounds</a>, I got to see how they do it.</p>

      <h1>Ruben Amorim is gone, but Manchester United’s forever crisis rolls on | Jonathan Wilson</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The head coach (or should that be manager?) fired cryptic shots at his Old Trafford bosses, then was fired himself</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Discontent at Manchester United these days is only ever deferred. Ruben Amorim’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/05/ruben-amorim-sacked-by-manchester-united-transfers-power-struggle">departure from the club</a> on Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh. He had made a half-hearted protest about the recruitment structure after Sunday’s draw at Leeds, but it felt even at the time like barely more than a gesture. And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.</p>
<p>Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.</p>

      <p>Most people join social movements to try to change the world, but many also find community and a greater sense of purpose</p>
<p>When Lani Ritter Hall’s beloved husband of more than 40 years, Gus, died in 2022, she felt a bit unmoored. Taking care of him had been the thing that got her out of bed in the morning, and with him gone, the 76-year-old felt she’d lost her purpose.</p>
<p>That is, until she found organizing.</p>

      <p>Pacific Grove is known as ‘Butterfly Town USA’ for its role as an overwintering spot. As the insect’s population plummets, residents are coming to its rescue</p>
<p>In the tiny seaside village of Pacific Grove, California, there’s no escaping the monarch butterfly.</p>
<p>Here, butterfly murals abound: one splashes across the side of a hotel, another adorns a school. As for local businesses, there’s the Monarch Pub, the Butterfly Grove Inn, even Monarch Knitting (a local yarn shop). And every fall, the small city hosts a butterfly parade, where local elementary school children dress up in butterfly costumes. The city’s municipal code even declares it an unlawful act to “molest or interfere” with monarchs in any way, with a possible fine of $1,000.</p>

<p>When Americans go to cast ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, much of the attention is likely to be on races for the US House, Senate and governorships – contests that will serve as a referendum on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s first two years in office and determine the trajectories of the final ones.</p>
<p>But further down the ballot, voters will choose secretaries of state in key races that could have a major effect on how elections are run in many US states, including several battleground states that are key to the 2028 presidential race. Twenty-six states are set to choose secretaries of state next year, including the presidential battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona and Michigan.</p>

      <p>John Harbaugh has spent nearly two decades leading Baltimore. But his failure to get the most out of his quarterback is a fireable failing</p>

It wasn’t just a loss; it was a referendum. The game was vintage, grubby, beautiful AFC North football. A rivalry game with a playoff place on the line. Big plays. Dumb decisions. Cris Collinsworth making unintelligible noises on commentary. In the final three minutes, four plays swung the win probability by more than 40 percentage points.</p>
<p>The Steelers, missing DK Metcalf and Darnell Washington, scored on four of their five second-half drives, three of them touchdowns, with Aaron Rodgers finding Calvin Austin for a 26-yard score with 55 seconds left. Baltimore, by contrast, couldn’t get out of their own way until Lamar Jackson strapped on his cape, completing seven of his final nine passes, throwing two touchdowns and converting <a href="https://x.com/All_22_NFL_Cuts/status/2008026031148683394">a ridiculously clutch fourth-down strike</a> to Isaiah Likely with 21 seconds left and the season on the line.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Nicolás Maduro, the deposed Venezuelan president, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-new-york-court">expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon</a> on drugs and weapons charges after US special forces seized him in a shocking raid at the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>What is the reaction in Caracas?</strong> While some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/few-in-caracas-are-celebrating-as-they-face-an-uncertain-post-maduro-future">quietly rejoiced at Maduro’s demise</a>, the traumatic night-time assault on the city prompted stockpiling, uncertainty and fear.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the global impact of Trump’s slashing of climate science?</strong> It’s substantial. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites and studies to track extreme weather in Europe, plan disaster responses in the Caribbean and monitor deforestation in the Amazon.</p>

      <h1>Trump push to politicize US military ‘reminiscent of Stalin’, top general warns</h1>

      <p>Maj Gen Paul Eaton says US president’s effort to bend military to his will could have dire long-term consequences</p>
<p>Donald Trump and his defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> are mounting an aggressive push to politicise the top ranks of the US military – a push that smacks of Stalinism and could take years to repair, the former infantry chief who trained troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/iraq-war-invasion-2003-aftermath-middle-east-islamic-state">invade Iraq</a> has warned.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Paul Eaton has sounded the alarm, saying in an interview with the Guardian that the effort to bend the higher echelons of the military to the US president’s will was unparalleled in recent history and could have long-term dire consequences. He warned that both the reputation and efficiency of the world’s most powerful fighting force was in the balance.</p>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The 2024 presidential race was the first big election to happen in the new generative AI era. There have, of course, been major concerns that the technology could be used to deceive voters or interfere with the exercise of democracy. But so far, that kind of activity has been limited, according to Tim Harper, a senior policy analyst and coauthor of a recent report from the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defends capture of Nicolás Maduro and says US has ‘leverage’ over country</p>
<p>Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and prominent Republicans swiftly backpedaled from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry">assertion</a> that the US will run <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> in transition after US forces snatched the president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to the US to face federal criminal charges.</p>
<p>Rubio appeared on numerous US politics shows on Sunday morning to defend the US operation in the early hours of Saturday to capture Maduro and his wife despite critics calling the operation illegal on multiple levels and the White House failing to demonstrate how it would run the South American nation.</p>

<p>The first year of his second term was marked by crackdowns on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate</a> science that produced world-class weather forecasts and the gutting of frontline federal agencies - policies that have left the country, already struggling to keep pace with severe storms, even more at risk.</p>

      <p>From Los Angeles to Nevada, younger people are preserving a longstanding tradition one lyric at a time</p>
<p>Deep in the heart of Los Angeles’s Koreatown, just a few doors down from H Mart and a K-pop music superstore, an American flag hangs over the entrance of a saloon called Eastwood.</p>
<p>The western-themed bar would normally be cranking Luke Bryan while customers play skee-ball, line dance and get bucked off their mechanical bull named Gucci. But tonight, the music is low and the loudest sounds come from the clacking of vintage mechanical typewriters. About 30 people in the bar are drafting poems about horses, sunsets and Stetson hats – which are plentiful atop the heads in the crowd.</p>
<p><em>Heck, they thought they killed me back in</em> <em>15</em></p>
<p><em>flew me out in a chopper, covered me with a sheet.</em></p>

<p>“No governor should have the power to unilaterally declare a civil rights or advocacy group he disagrees with a terrorist organization, take punitive action against them, all in violation of due process and free speech,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Guardian this month. “If any governor can get away with abusing that kind of power, then no organization is safe.”</p>

<p>Jackery has just pulled the wraps off its newest portable power station, the Explorer 1500 Ultra, and it’s aiming squarely at people who actually use these things outside – not just those who keep them pristine in a garage for the occasional blackout. Unveiled this week at CES 2026, the new unit is designed to be tougher, lighter, and more weather-resistant than most power stations in its class, with specs showing how Jackery is leaning hard into real-world use cases.</p>
<p>Beyond just portable power, the company is also showcasing innovative new products that target much bigger ambitions – literally. With a new solar gazebo and a self-following robot, the Jackery is dramatically expanding the scope of its solar and portable power initiatives.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan oil industry has been “a total bust” for a long time, according to Donald Trump. After attacking Caracas and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/04/nicolas-maduro-jailed-us-attack-venezuela-donald-trump-reaction-latest-news-updates-live">taking the country’s leader captive</a>, Trump promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/us-oil-trump-venezuela">take control</a> of Venezuela’s oil industry with the help of America’s biggest oil companies.</p>
<p>Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry could “make a lot of money” with the might of the US behind it, Trump told the press, claiming that the new regime would invest billions to revive its fortunes.</p>

      <h1>Venezuela attack: what we know so far as US captures President Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York</p>
<p>The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:</p>
<p>Donald Trump said <strong>“We’re going to run the country</strong>[Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.</p>
<p><strong>A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening</strong> and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation</strong> <strong>, Trump</strong> <strong>said.</strong> He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.</strong> It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>UN security council</strong> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0">due to hold</a> an emergency meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump said his administration <strong>had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong>. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”</p>
<p>The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered <strong>vice president Delcy Rodríguez</strong> to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.</p>
<p><strong>Trump was asked about Cuba</strong> during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Justice released a new indictment</strong> against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.</p>
<p><strong>The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”</strong> <strong>.</strong> Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398">wrote</a>: “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro</strong> <strong>was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.</strong> The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.</p>
<p>The <strong>UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela</strong>, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.</p>

<p>The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, follow a long history of interventions in South and Central America and the Caribbean over the past two centuries. But they also mark an unprecedented moment as the first direct US military attack on a South American country.</p>
<p>At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.</p>

<p>Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.</p>
<p>Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.</p>

<p>As they were jolted from their beds just before 2am on Saturday, many Caracas residents sought an innocent explanation for the racket that had interrupted their sleep: an exploding air conditioning unit, a tropical thunderstorm, an earthquake. Or perhaps a festive display of pyrotechnics over Venezuela’s mountain-flanked capital.</p>
<p>“I thought it might be fireworks,” Carlos Hurtado, a resident of the 23 de Enero housing estate on the city’s west side, recalled of the moment he was woken by a mysterious sequence of rumblings and explosions.</p>

<p>Overnight on Friday, the US carried out airstrikes across Venezuela, with explosions rocking the capital, Caracas, before dawn. Shortly afterwards, Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them out of the country.</p>
<p>The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said they would face trial in New York on charges of involvement in narco-terrorism. A fresh indictment was issued on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The Sisters of Watts have served families for a decade, providing food, fitness, money and after-school programs</p>
<p>The weekend before Thanksgiving, the gymnasium in Ted Watkins park in the south Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts was crowded with more than 100 families. For three hours, they ate and talked while their kids ran around and a DJ blasted west coast hip-hop staples during games of limbo and musical chairs.</p>
<p>Toward the back of the room, people clamored around a step-and-repeat to get a picture with the event’s organizers: four siblings known as the Sisters of Watts, who for the past decade have arranged food giveaways, backpack drives and after-school activities for kids growing up on the same blocks they did. At this event, there were bags of fresh produce available for families that wanted them.</p>

      <p>New documents reveal numerous missed opportunities as experts and victims condemn US authorities’ failures</p>
<p>Over the course of two decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women. And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.</p>
<p>The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct. The issue has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, often focusing on the idea that Epstein – who lived at the center of a network of powerful people – enjoyed some form of protection.</p>

<p>Nikki Massie never had a reason to question her salary. After more than a decade with the same company, she’d earned awards, promotions and the trust of co-workers who felt like family. But then one day, she discovered she might have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars over the years. Nikki began to wonder: What do you do when you suspect you’ve been underpaid? And at what point do you consider walking away?</p>

      <h1>US homeland security condemned for using Japanese artist’s work without consent</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Hiroshi Nagai, in a post on X, has objected to his artwork being used by the agency to promote its deportation agenda</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is facing backlash once again, this time from a Japanese artist who has condemned the agency for using, without permission, his work to promote deportations.</p>
<p>In a post on X on New Year’s Eve, the department posted a photo featuring a pristine and empty beach with palm trees and a vintage car. Written across the photo was “America after 100 million deportations,” along with a separate caption that said: “The peace of a nation no longer besieged by the third world.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>A shift away from police-led responses spreads, but gaps in crisis teams leave some communities exposed</p>
<p>In the past year, a handful of sheriff’s departments in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> have <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/04/mental-health-crisis-california-police-response/">started refusing to respond</a> to 911 calls that involve a mental health crisis, but where no crime has been reported.</p>
<p>In February, the Sacramento sheriff, Jim Cooper, announced that his deputies would only respond to mental health crises if a crime had been committed or was in process, or if someone other than the person in crisis was in imminent danger. Down in San Diego county, the police chief for the city of El Cajon, Jeremiah Larson, made a similar policy decision in May.</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Greg Abel has officially taken the reins at Berkshire Hathaway, stepping into the role long held by the titan of value investing, Warren Buffett.

And do professional movie critics still matter in an age of Reddit threads and Letterboxd reviews?</p>

      <p>
      <p>A once-toxic topic is helping survivors and relatives of victims get elected to enact the laws they helped draft</p>
<p>A new generation of young political leaders is gaining power in the US by using their personal experience with gun violence to push for reforms they say the US is ready for.</p>
<p>Their ascent is part of a nearly decade-long shift, from gun violence prevention being a third-rail issue in politics that was rarely spoken about on campaign trails, to one that candidates, most of them Democrats, are now running – and winning – on.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable. Here are major trends that emerged last year</p>
<p>As the Trump administration boosts fossil fuels, Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable for alleged climate deception. That wave of litigation swelled in 2025, with groundbreaking cases filed and wins notched.</p>
<p>But the year also brought setbacks, as Trump attacked the cases and big oil worked to have them thrown out. The industry also worked to secure a shield from current and future climate lawsuits.</p>

      <h1>Amid wide healthcare cuts, a bright spot for rural hospitals</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Healthcare costs are climbing for many Americans as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits roll back, raising premiums for middle-income households unless Congress intervenes. In this vacuum, we look at a major new federal investment aimed at expanding healthcare access in rural communities. Plus, U.S. travel is sending mixed signals this year — domestic travel is booming, but fewer international visitors are visiting the States, and that shift is being felt by America’s museums.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Swiss investigators are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire">racing to identify the victims of a fire</a> that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fire start?</strong> The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to identify the dead?</strong> Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he say?</strong> Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”</p>

      <h1>USMNT’s World Cup, Arsenal’s title challenge and Real’s power struggle: soccer questions for 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>The world of soccer throws up no shortage of questions every year. In today’s Pitch Points column, we address three of the big ones for 2026</p>
<p>You may have heard there’s a World Cup this year. After all the debate about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/18/analysis-how-prices-for-the-cheapest-world-cup-tickets-have-rocketed">ticket prices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/trump-peace-prize-fifa-world-cup">peace prizes</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/08/fifa-world-cup-2026-cooling-breaks">cooling breaks</a>, an actual soccer tournament will kick off. That’s when the US, both as a national team and a host nation, will truly be judged; when the 2026 World Cup will be deemed a soaring success or a grotesque failure. There will be no in between. No nuance. That vanished from public discourse a long time ago.</p>

      <h1>‘No one can know’: Heated Rivalry’s gay love story exposes ice hockey’s culture of silence</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>The surprise hit series has reopened a familiar debate: why, in the National Hockey League, visibility is still treated as a problem rather than a possibility</p>
<p>At around the midpoint of the first episode of Heated Rivalry, just after Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov – one Canadian, the other Russian, both hockey’s top prospects – have had their first tryst, Hollander sits at the side of his hotel bed and says: “So. You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?” Rozanov, lying naked beside him, replies sarcastically: “Me? Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”</p>
<p>No one can know. If hockey were to have an unofficial slogan, this might be it. Heated Rivalry, the surprise 2025 hit series from Crave and HBO, is layered drama, prompting timely questions about the barriers to acceptance that persist within sport even as they are lowered elsewhere across society. But it may be that hockey’s existential battle with its culture of silence is the show’s deepest target.</p>

<p><em>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/guardian-footballer-of-the-year">Guardian Footballer of the Year</a> is an award given to a player who has done something remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty.</em></p>
<p>Jess Carter has spent her life grappling with when to hold back and when to speak up; wrestling with being naturally herself, embodying the characteristics her parents instilled in her of being open, honest, vocal and confident, and subduing herself because, while society values those traits, in a black woman they can be viewed negatively.</p>

      <p>Toby Morton now owns trumpkennedycenter.org, which advertises new year performance by the ‘Epstein dancers’</p>
<p>Donald Trump may be remaking the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts into a pool of his self-reflection, but a writer for South Park, the TV series that better reflects the obsessions and tendencies of the administration than any political pundit, has purchased the rights to <a href="https://www.trumpkennedycenter.org/" title="">trumpkennedycenter.org</a>.</p>
<p>Toby Morton, a TV writer and producer who has worked on the long-running and joyfully offensive sitcom, said he purchased the domain in August after predicting the president would change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center after he installed himself as chair and stocked the board with loyalists.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The winter holiday season is a key time for nonprofit fundraising — an estimated 30% of annual giving happens in December. But in 2025, highly publicized federal cuts resulted in an individual giving boost throughout the year. In this episode, some nonprofits worry demand will soon outgrow those private donations. Plus: Latino immigrants say deportation fears are reminiscent of the Covid-19 lockdown, communities fight to buy back private utilities, and “This Is Uncomfortable” host Reema Khrais gives tips for sticking to financial New Year’s resolutions.</p>

      <p><em>Hey smarties! Happy New Year. We’re taking a short break for the holidays. In the meantime, we’re sharing an episode from our friends over at “This Is Uncomfortable.” Reema Khrais and the team are getting ready to relaunch the show on Jan. 15. Stay tuned for new episodes!</em></p>
<p>When newlyweds Chantal and Travis Lisback started searching for their dream home in Seattle, they weren’t entirely on the same page. Chantal was eager to settle down as soon as possible, while Travis was more comfortable waiting a few years. As the search dragged on, what began as a shared dream started to feel more like a standoff.</p>
<p>This week, a story about how a big life decision can bring to light the money and communication issues you didn’t know were there. Plus, later in the episode, Chantal and Travis sit down with financial therapist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ajaetherapy/">Aja Evans</a> to unpack what’s happening beneath the surface, and how to approach money fights with more care and intention.</p>

<p>One of the biggest unanswered questions for many folks considering an e-bike isn’t how a bike rides on day one, but rather how it holds up after years of daily use. Reviews and first impressions are everywhere, but genuine long-term ownership stories are surprisingly rare. That’s why a recent shared case from a rider who just crossed 10,000 miles (16,000 km) on their e-bike caught my attention.</p>

      <p>Abortion was seen as one of Democrats’ strongest issues in the 2024 election – new polls indicate that may be shifting</p>
<p>Up to seven states will vote on abortion rights this year. But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count onthe issue in their efforts todrive votes in the 2026 midterms, after makingabortion rightsthe centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followedthe fall of Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/09/poll-abortion-voters-motivations-priorities/">PRRI’s findings mirror a September poll</a> from the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.</p>

      <p>Sheldon Whitehouse, an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center board, remains undeterred and determined to press on with his investigation</p>
<p>“That’s the tactic they use,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator, pondering whether Donald Trump might attach his name to the <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/">John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>. “You float stuff and you float stuff and you float stuff until people get inured to what a stupid or outrageous thing it is that has been floated and then you pull the trigger.”</p>
<p>Whitehouse was sitting in his Senate office and speaking to the Guardian at 11am on Thursday 18 December. Two hours later, his words proved prophetic. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/2001717032191168839?s=20">announced on X</a> that the Kennedy Center board had “voted unanimously” to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center.</p>

      <p>President auctioned off portrait painted live onstage and said his new year’s resolution was ‘peace on Earth’</p>
<p>Donald Trump welcomed 2026 with a glitzy bash at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach where he auctioned off a freshly painted portrait of Jesus Christ for $2.75m and said his new year’s resolution was a wish for “peace on Earth”.</p>
<p>The portrait of Jesus had been painted on stage by artist Vanessa Horabuena, who, <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/politics/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-charity-auction/2025/12/31/id/1240393/">the president said</a>, was “one of the greatest artists anywhere in the world”.</p>

      <h1>US federal employees file complaint against ban on gender-affirming care</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Complaint argues Trump administration denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination</p>
<p>The Trump administration is facing a legal complaint from a group of government employees affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Gas prices hit their lowest level for a December since 2020, according to AAA, thanks largely to a global oil glut that pushed crude prices down about 20% last year. We look at whether cheaper fuel is likely to stick around in 2025. Plus, a new business in New York City doubles as a museum celebrating the history and cultural impact of the photo booth. And we examine how the expiration of federal tax credits is reshaping the electric vehicle market after a rocky year.</p>

      <p>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the democratic socialist who is now mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos">viral memes</a> and its candidate’s witty quips.</p>
<p>Here are some of the quotes that came to define his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats">historic</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral">push</a> to lead one of the world’s most important cities:</p>
<p>New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.</p>
<p>What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.</p>
<p>No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.</p>
<p>It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.</p>
<p>I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.</p>
<p>I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.</p>
<p>I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.</p>
<p>If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!</p>

      <h1>From Sehitler to Armstrong: 10 female footballers set for breakthrough in 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Today’s newsletter looks at 10 superlative talents who are ready to take the next step in the coming 12 months</p>
<p><strong>Alara Sehitler</strong> <strong>, Bayern Munich and Germany (19):</strong> Sehitler’s transition into Bayern Munich’s first team has come as little surprise and the creative midfielder has established herself as a strong impact player for José Barcala’s side. She has three Frauen Bundesliga goals this season and sparked Bayern’s comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League. After making her senior debut for Germany in November 2024, she will be looking to establish herself as a regular for their upcoming 2027 World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Giulia Galli</strong> <strong>, Roma and Italy (17):</strong> Galli is widely regarded as one of the best young Italian talents to emerge for a long time and became Roma’s youngest player to make her Serie A debut in May 2024, aged 16 and one month. Establishing herself in the senior squad this season, she scored her first club goal in September and has featured in the Champions League. After starring in Italy’s sensational run to the semi-finals of last summer’s Under-17 Euros, the talented forward played a significant role at the subsequent Under-17 World Cup, picking up the bronze boot. She will surely feature at this autumn’s Under-20 World Cup.</p>

      <p>From freezing rents to free buses and municipal grocery stores – a recap of the policies that won Mamdani the office</p>
<p>Zohran Mamdani was sworn into office as New York’s 111th mayor at the stroke of midnight, the first Muslim mayor as well as the first to take office as a Democrat bearing the credentials of a democratic socialist.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old was sworn in by Letitia James, the state attorney general, in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train, to be followed by a first-of-its-kind public block party along Broadway’s “Canyon of Heroes”.</p>

      <h1>How to talk dating like gen Z: 51 (hyperspecific) terms for love, sex and bad behavior</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>As young people take on a messy dating landscape, they’ve created their own lexicon to match. Here’s like what phrases ‘bird theory’ and ‘monkey branching’ mean</p>
<p>This year marked a decade since the term “ghosting” hit the mainstream. At the time, the idea that someone could abruptly cease communication with a lover without explanation seemed like the peak of indignity. How naive we were. In the 10 years since, finding a partner has only become more confounding – an oftentimes fruitless exercise in humiliation that is increasingly pigeonholed by social media jargon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">Gen Z</a>, a cohort who came of age during a loneliness epidemic, a masculinity crisis, and a coordinated attack on the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, faces a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2025/nov/28/gen-z-sex-dating-relationships">far messier landscape</a> than their millennial predecessors could ever imagine. And so their dating glossary has grown longer and more deranged, with phrases like “Shrekking” and “monkey branching” testing the limits of your sanity.</p>
<p><strong>Red flags</strong> – Behavioral quirks indicating a potential partner is bad news. Examples include calling their exes crazy, subpar tipping habits, a love of Woody Allen films, a burgeoning DJ career …</p>
<p><strong>Green flags</strong> – These quirks validate your decision to pursue a mate. Examples include checking in to make sure you got home safe after a date, low screen time, owning a bed frame …</p>
<p><strong>Beige flags</strong> – These usually describe niche, mostly benign quirks. Examples include being an enthusiastic birdwatcher, still carrying around a pen in their purse, paying rent in cash …</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>When it comes to homebuilding, Ronda Conger, vice president of CBH Homes, wants to be like the Savannah Bananas.</p>
<p>“We are out there trying to do things so differently,” she said. “It’s one of the reasons we embraced AI so quickly.”</p>
<p>But there are growing fears that artificial intelligence will begin to replace human employees. For Conger’s team, the bots are doing the grunt work, so the real humans can shine.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The continent’s problems are not caused by immigration or cultural politics but by economic and technological decline</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">national security strategy</a> offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.</p>
<p>That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the <a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/">US</a> is slightly higher than <a href="https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/">in Europe</a>.</p>
