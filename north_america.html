(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>Epstein files reveal messages between his accomplice and a man who appears to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor</p>
<p>A man identified as “A” who appears to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor discussed facilitating meetings with “inappropriate friends” with Jeffrey Epstein’s accompliceGhislaine Maxwell <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Among the latest tranche of Epstein files are email exchanges in 2001 and 2002 between Maxwell and a correspondent who appears as “The Invisible Man” in the email thread and says that he is writing from Balmoral.</p>

      <h1>Find me ‘inappropriate friends’: Epstein files put spotlight on emails from Balmoral – US politics live</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>New files include series of emails between Ghislaine Maxwell and someone who says he is at ‘Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family’</p>
<p>Another file released on Tuesday is a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035768.pdf">letter</a> that appears to have been sent by <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> to <strong>Larry Nassar</strong>, the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/usa-gymnastics-usopc-larry-nassar-lawsuit-settlement">gymnastics team doctor</a> convicted of sexually abusing scores of young gymnasts, while he was in jail.</p>
<p>In the letter, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035769.pdf">postmarked 13 August</a> 2019 and sent from jail, the letter reads:</p>
<p>Dear L.N. as you know by now, I have taken the “short route” home. Good Luck! <strong>We share one thing … our love &amp; caring for young ladies</strong> at the hope they’d reach their full potential. <strong>Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls</strong>. <strong>When a young beauty walked by he loved to “grab snatch,”</strong> whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.</p>
<p>To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.</p>

      <p>US government continues holding on to massive amounts of seized personal property, from diaries to cellphones</p>
<p>Georgia’s historic racketeering case in connection with opposition to the police training center known as Cop City continues hanging over the heads of 61 defendants, drawing into focus the state’s continuing possession of hundreds of cellphones, laptops and personal items.</p>
<p>The state’s case is believed to be the largest ever leveled against a protest or social movement using Rico, a law created to go after the mafia and usually associated with organized crime but here deployed against a largely environmental and criminal justice-focused movement.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tech giant Amazon says it's blocked more than 1,800 North Koreans from trying to join the company in the past two years. Amazon's chief security officer said North Koreans often try to get hired, then send wages back to fund their government's weapons programs. Plus, &quot;oshikatsu&quot; is a Japanese term referring to fervent fan subcultures surrounding things like sports teams, pop stars, or anime — and it's helped pull Japanese retail sales out of a slump.</p>

<p>There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and being included in the files does not indicate any criminal wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The number of people in immigration detention in the US has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration">hit an all-time high</a>, according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p><strong>What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?</strong> In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">no criminal record</a> continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)</p>
<p><strong>How are ordinary people fighting back?</strong> As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back">Julia Carrie Wong reports</a> on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.</p>
<p><strong>What did Trump say about Clinton?</strong> “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?</strong> The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action">a resolution</a> directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.</p>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>By representing its region’s distinct culture and players, the Canadian Premier League team aims to boost the province’s undoubted soccer potential</p>
<p>Boulevard Saint-Laurent is one of Montréal’s great arteries, a throughway for gourmands coveting smoked meat sandwiches or proper pizza at one of a dozen different joints in Little Italy. It’s also home to Evangelista Sports, a shop that has doubled as a shrine to the city’s soccer-obsessed for more than 40 years and is every bit a part of Montréal’s cultural fabric as poutine or lamenting the cold.</p>
<p>It’s also where FC Supra du Québec opted to announce their first-ever signings last week. The Canadian Premier League (CPL) expansion team is looking to become part of the city and province’s cultural identity, hoping their commitment to recruiting a full roster of Québec-born or raised players, inspired by European clubs like Athletic Bilbao, will go a long way in helping to build a pathway which has so often seen talent slip through the cracks.</p>

      <p>The US press have suffered about as many assaults this year as in the previous three years combined</p>
<p>The United States has seen a dramatic increase in violence against journalists since Donald Trump again took office.</p>
<p>Most of the reporters and photographers who were allegedly attacked by law enforcement officials were covering protests over the Trump administration’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a non-profit that tracks such incidents.</p>

      <p>In January, we saw a who's who of tech leaders front and center at President Donald Trump's inauguration.</p>
<p>Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.</p>
<p>To review the year in tech and Trump we called up Suyash Pasi, a research analyst and editor at the nonprofit Human Rights Research Center, who’s been following this shift.</p>

<p>Warriors forward Draymond Green had a heated exchange with his head coach, Steve Kerr, in a third-quarter huddle during Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic before leaving the court and heading to the locker room to calm down.</p>
<p>“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Hey Smarties! We’re dropping into your feeds today to share this special coverage from Marketplace.</p>
<p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants. We visit a refugee farmer in Houston, a chocolate-making lab in California, and stop for a bite at an award-winning restaurant in Portland.</p>

      <p>Controversially appointed editor-in-chief Bari Weiss says: ‘I held that story and I held it because it wasn’t ready’</p>
<p>CBS News was dealing with internal and external uproar on Monday after it pulled at the last minute an investigation for its flagship 60 Minutes show into the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2025/mar/20/cecot-el-salvador-venezuela-prison-trump-deportations">harsh prison in El Salvador</a> where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans from the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The episode about the Cecot mega-prison was due to air on Sunday night. However, in an “editor’s note” <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/2002854497685582309">posted on X</a> late that afternoon, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”</p>

      <h1>Wolves’ freefall leaves even Derby’s dismal record low a lofty goal</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seen</p>
<p>Saturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a Premier League season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.</p>
<p>How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.</p>

      <p>Interior department move affects five projects under construction in latest blow to industry targeted by Trump</p>
<p>The Trump administration has said it is immediately pausing all leases for offshore wind farms already under construction, in the heaviest blow yet to an industry that the administration has relentlessly targeted throughout the year.</p>
<p>Trump’s Department of the Interior said that it was halting the building of five wind projects due to “national security risks”. The department said it would work with the US Department of Defense to mitigate the risk of the wind turbine towers creating radar interference called “clutter” that could in some way hamper the US military.</p>

      <p>A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule designed to give consumers greater control over their financial data is now in limbo under the second Trump administration.

      <p>Video shared by the US Geological Survey on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone national park. Other recent eruptions have mostly been audible but not visible because they happened either at night or when the camera was obscured by ice. The agency said the Black Diamond Pool was previously the site of a hydrothermal explosion, in July 2024, that sent rocks and mud flying hundreds of feet into the air and damaged a boardwalk. It prompted the closure of the area to visitors due to the damage and potential for additional hazardous activity</p>

<p>Seven weeks ago, the Jaguars were still <em>that</em> team: loose, entertaining, unreliable. The kind that could light up a quarter and then spend the next three undoing it. Now, they’re a wagon.</p>
<p>After beating the Broncos on Sunday, the Jaguars have ripped off six straight wins. They’ve won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 2007. And with two winnable games to close the season, they have a solid path to the No 1 seed, with the AFC potentially running through Jacksonville.</p>

      <p>Medetomidine has extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms – and the detox centers that help patients are struggling with how best to cope</p>
<p>The staff at harm reduction hub Sunshine House in the middle of Kensington, a neighborhood in north-east Philadelphia home to the most notorious open drug scene in the US, often reverse at least one overdose per day.</p>
<p>But the mutating illegal drug supply is regularly conjuring new drugs with novel sets of potentially deadly risks. For the past 18 months, there has been a new drug in circulation, the veterinary sedative medetomidine, also known as “rhino tranq”. It has perhaps the most extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms of all known street drugs.</p>

      <p>The holiday travel period is upon us. AAA expects 122 million people will drive or fly somewhere to celebrate. Now, we have some good news and some bad news: For drivers, lower gas prices mean a cheaper holiday season. But other travel-related expenses, like car rentals, hotel stays, and flights, are pricier. Then, Jim Beam is pausing production at a Kentucky facility, and more consumers are utilizing AI to help with holiday shopping.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files">casts fresh light</a> on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.</p>
<p><strong>The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law – can Congress do anything?</strong> Lawmakers threatening legal action face major obstacle: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/epstein-files-doj-congress">those with legal power in this case are the ones accused of failing to follow the law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Cecot being investigated?</strong> In March, the Trump administration struck a deal with El Salvador to send to Cecot more than 250 Venezuelan migrants that it accused of terrorism and gang membership. Horror stories have since emerged about abuse that they are alleged to have endured, with lawyers for some of the men who were later released describing the conditions as “state-sanctioned torture”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Could AI chat bots replace human doctors? Probably not, but that won’t stop people from trying.</p>

Today on the show, Dr. Hassan Bencheqroun, a pulmonary and intensive care doctor in San Diego, California, talks about his approach to the intersection of patient care and AI.</p>

      <p>Beach sprints are shaking up this most strait-laced of sports and may be heading to a coastal town near you</p>
<p>At a point when most rowers are pounding away on rivers in the wind and rain through the dark winter months, a new breed are honing their skills in brighter climes surrounded by sun, sand and waves, all the while dreaming of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
<p>Out of 17 sports that proposed an extra discipline to the International Olympic Committee, rowing came out on top with its beach sprints format added to the LA 2028 programme. While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.</p>

<p>Corruption is a word that’s come up throughout this year in relation to U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. There have been allegations of personal enrichment, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, through his family’s crypto and real estate ventures. There are also accusations of quid pro quo deals with foreign leaders and convicted criminals seeking pardons.
Is this a bug in Trump’s administration, or a feature?
To put it all into focus, Tommy Vietor is here. He’s been following this issue of corruption on his very popular podcast, Pod Save America. He also co-hosts Pod Save the World.

<p>The US justice department said on Sunday it had restored an image it had removed a day earlier from the public release of investigative files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> after concluding that the photograph, which included within it a photo of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, posed no risk of public exposure to victims of the late convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>The justice department said the image had been flagged by federal prosecutors in New York for potentially exposing victims of Epstein. Its unexplained removal on Saturday triggered a chorus of accusations from Democrats about evident political interference in favor of the president, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-epstein-friendship">former friend</a> of Epstein.</p>

<p>Before Joseph DeAngelo, a 74-year-old navy veteran and former police officer, admitted responsibility for his brutal crimes in court, prosecutor Thien Ho had a request for the judge overseeing the proceedings. He wanted the world to see the killer’s face.</p>
<p>It was 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and social distancing and masking requirements were in full swing.

<p>For years, oil tanker traffic has been prohibited off the coast of northern British Columbia in order to protect environmentally sensitive coastlines from disaster. But the federal government is now open to the idea of changing its moratorium — something the B.C. government and First Nations vehemently oppose.</p>

<p>Last December, Alberta rolled out its $29-million provincial border strategy in response to tariff threats from Donald Trump.

<p>Caleb Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore in overtime, and the Chicago Bears overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter Saturday night for a 22-16 win over the Green Bay Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love to a concussion.</p>
<p>The Bears (11-4) extended their lead in the NFC North to one and a half games over the Packers (9-5-1) with two left to play and got some payback for a loss at Lambeau Field two weeks earlier. It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.</p>

<p>A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.</p>
<p>Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.</p>
<p>Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”</p>
<p>The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

      <p>Angel Ureña said ex-president, pictured in some photos released by justice department, cut ties with Epstein in 2005</p>
<p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton">Bill Clinton</a> accused the White House late on Friday of using him as a scapegoat after pictures of the former president with sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as with a young woman in a pool, were included as part of congressionally ordered release of government files.</p>
<p>“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” <a href="https://x.com/angelurena/status/2002159039183269993?s=46&amp;t=bc4OjMQq3SFcud7QML4uPw">the spokesperson said in a statement on X.</a></p>

<p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.</p>

<p>Conservative reaction to the partial release of documents in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> case has been mixed, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> supporters highlighting the prominent presence of Bill Clinton and other Democrats in photographs, with others lamenting how the heavy redaction casts Donald Trump and Republicans in a bad light.</p>
<p>Administration officials defended the redactions with fervent hyperbole. “Never in American history has a President or the Department of Justice been this transparent with the American people about such a sensitive law enforcement matter,” said Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who released <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims">a six-page letter describing the redaction process</a>.</p>

      <p>The Golden State’s clean energy use hit new highs in 2025. As the Trump administration abandons US climate initiatives, can California fill the void?</p>
<p>As officials from around the world met in Brazil for the Cop30 climate summit last month, the US president was nowhere to be found, nor were any members of his cabinet. Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>.</p>
<p>During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/11/gavin-newsom-trump-cop30">invasive species</a>” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.</p>

      <h1>Vonn’s Olympic comeback gathers pace with third in Val d’Isere downhill</h1>

<p>Vonn, 41, third in Val d’Isere downhill despite costly error</p>

</ul>
<p>Lindsey Vonn’s expectations have shifted so dramatically during her Olympic comeback that even a podium finish now comes with a sense of frustration.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old American finished third in Saturday’s women’s World Cup downhill at Val d’Isère, France, extending a blistering start to the season that has already included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41">a victory</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/13/lindsey-vonn-second-emma-aicher-world-cup-downhill-st-moritz">a runner-up finish</a> in the space of nine days. But after a small mistake on the lower section of the course cost her valuable time, Vonn left the finish area convinced she had let a potential win slip away.</p>

      <p>Anthony Joshua has said he wants to take on Tyson Fury next, after knocking Jake Paul out in the sixth round of their fight in Miami on Friday night. Joshua dropped Paul four times in the one-sided affair, and then called out Fury – even impersonating his fellow British heavyweight as he urged him to 'sign the contract'. On YouTuber turned boxer Paul, who went to hospital with a broken jaw, Joshua said: 'Jake has spirit, he has some heart. He tried his best and I take my hat off to him.'</p>

<p>The initial decoration of a couple of 'eyesore' tree stumps in Creston, B.C. by an anonymous source, leads town staff on a holiday–season decorating mission to spruce up the remaining stumps. While reactions to the initiative are mixed, the festive stumps have certainly become a talking point in the normally quiet southeastern B.C., mountain town.</p>

<p>Canada's growing profile in Antarctic research may get another boost in early 2026, as the commander of the Royal Canadian Navy confirms a possible second expedition is in the works, in collaboration with the Chilean navy. Climate scientists from the first all-Canadian expedition in March hope it offers the chance to collect more samples, as preliminary results come in from the earlier research mission.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice on Friday released a long-awaited and huge tranche of documents detailing its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major development in the lengthy saga that turned into one of the biggest political setbacks Donald Trump has suffered since his re-election last year.</p>
<p>While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>Investigative notes describing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffery Epstein</a>’s detailed demands of the people he sent to procure children for his sexual predation are among the documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday.</p>
<p>They cast a grim spotlight on the actions of Epstein and those around him amid their efforts to procure young women and underage girls for the late disgraced financier. They were part of a long-awaited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department">release of documents</a> from Donald Trump’s justice department, which has been slammed for being only a partial release and heavily redacted.</p>

<p>Thirty members of Congress are demanding answers from Dollar General and Family Dollar, requesting internal documents about widespread disparities between shelf prices and register prices at the dollar-store chains’ 28,000 US stores.</p>
<p>The demand for answers – detailed in a <a href="https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/budzinski.house.gov/uploads/2025/12/Letter-to-Dollar-General-and-Family-Dollar-re_-Price-Transparency-12-19-2025.pdf">letter</a> sent on Friday to the CEOs of both companies – comes as the direct result of a 3 December Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/customers-pay-more-rising-dollar-store-costs">investigation</a> of the two national chains. The investigation found that Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span.</p>

<p>Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.</p>
<p>The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.</p>

The company turned down a renewed offer from Paramount of $30 a share, signaling a continued preference for the Netflix deal. Thing is, the transaction will likely draw close regulatory scrutiny from the Trump administration. But first: messy economic data and a deal to buy TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: sepia-toned Bears v Packers rivalry takes center stage</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Chicago can edge closer to sealing the NFC North in a sepia-toned Soldier Field showdown that headlines a pivotal week in the NFL playoff race</p>
<p>Another week as the NFL winds up for the postseason offers a fresh look at contenders building for the Super Bowl. Jacksonville v Denver, yes please. Baltimore v New England, bingo. Pittsburgh v Detroit, hmm … OK. Still not satisfied? The strange lights of Saturday night over in the NFC North should do the trick with a sepia-toned showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. A win for either and a Detroit defeat confirms a playoff slot while victory for the Bears gets them close to sealing the division (even in defeat the Packers still will be ahead for the seventh seed). The gaping hole left by Micah Parsons in Green Bay’s defensive front may have Chicago fans edging to the side of expectation that their Bears can put together a deep playoff run if home-field advantage is on their side.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s EPA wants to weaken formaldehyde protections – this is what it could mean</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)

      <p>EPA proposed undoing Biden-era policy on exposure to carcinogenic toxin in latest push to weaken toxin standards</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s Environmental Protection Agency ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa">EPA</a>) is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca/epa-releases-updated-draft-risk-calculation-memorandum-formaldehyde-under-tsca">proposing</a> to increase the levels of exposure to highly carcinogenic formaldehyde it considers safe. If successful, people would continue to be exposed to concerning amounts of the toxin in thousands of everyday products used across the economy, experts and advocates say.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde, a pungent colorless gas at room temperature, is found in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, home cleaners, craft supplies, leather goods, furniture, clothing, plastic, building materials and other everyday goods. During <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s term, EPA scientists took a major step toward reining in the broad societal risk by issuing a finding that any level of exposure to formaldehyde can cause cancer, and very low levels cause non-cancer health harms.</p>

      <p>Electricity prices are up 6.9% year over year — much higher than overall inflation — and costs are expected to go up even more in the future. So, how are energy-hungry data centers, used to power AI, crypto, and more, impacting electric bills? That's a question that several Senate Democrats had, who opened an investigation into tech firms this week. Also on the show: TikTok ownership and real estate agents' thoughts on the market.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A man suspected of killing two people and wounding nine others at Brown University before going on to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/suspect-brown-university-shooting">has been found dead</a> in a New Hampshire storage facility, where he had rented a unit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How has the White House responded to the</strong> <strong>incident?</strong> The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has ordered the suspension of the green card lottery program at Donald Trump’s direction, saying it had enabled the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to enter the US.</p>
<p><strong>What did Volodymyr Zelenskyy say about the deal?</strong> The Ukrainian president wrote on social media that the deal “is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.”</p>

      <p>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience</p>
<p>When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.</p>
<p>In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2001475597109772655">Erin Burnett</a>, Garcia said a petition to the federal court by Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s convicted accomplice - to have her conviction on sex trafficking charges thrown out and to obtain a pardon do not trigger an exemption to the law Congress passed mandating a release of documents by the DoJ.</p>

      <h1>Police investigate links between Brown shooting and killing of MIT professor</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Sources say person of interest identified in attack at university and death of prominent physicist 50 miles away</p>
<p>Authorities said Thursday that they’re looking into a connection between last weekend’s mass shooting at Brown University and one two days later near Boston that killed a professor at another elite school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>That is according to three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss an investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the people said investigators had identified a person of interest in the shootings and were actively seeking that individual.</p>

      <h1>Deadline nears for release of Epstein files – what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department must release most documents by Friday, and failure to do so would provoke a firestorm</p>
<p>In less than 48 hours, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release most of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">files</a> related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in its possession. Last month, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi">subsequently pledged</a> to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)

      <p>Brooks, who dismissed Epstein scandal as ‘stupid story’, wrote column expressing lack of interest in developments</p>
<p>The New York Times columnist David Brooks appeared in multiple photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein that were released on Thursday by the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p>
<p>The photos, which have been rolled out in batches by the minority Democrats in the committee, lack crucial context, including dates and locations. But the photos appear to show Brooks attending a lunch or dinner event. Brooks is shown seated next to Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.</p>

<p>As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>Over what the magazine said was 11 separate interviews by reporter Chris Whipple, Susie Wiles spoke candidly about her colleagues, describing Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, JD Vance, the vice-president, as being a “conspiracy theorist for a decade” and Russell Vought, the budget chief, as a “right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>

      <h1>Meg O’Neill: ‘hard-nosed’ outsider who will head BP’s pivot away from green energy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>First female appointment to a major oil company has faced fierce resistance from climate activists as boss of Woodside</p>
<p>The surprise appointment of BP’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive">third chief executive in a tumultuous five years</a> reflects the embattled fossil fuel producer’s need for profound change. The hiring of Meg O’Neill appears to offer exactly that.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, is the first female head of a major oil company, and the first “outsider” to be hired to a position usually reserved for company veterans. She joins from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside, where she took up her first chief executive role only four years ago.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)

      <p>DoJ says a group of protesters at an ICE detention center was part of a terror cell; legal experts say it is an effort to crack down on leftwing groups and deter protesters</p>
<p>After the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September, Donald Trump and others pledged a no-holds barred crackdown on leftwing activists.</p>
<p>“We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” Trump said after Kirk’s shooting. Top White House officials, including JD Vance and Stephen Miller, repeatedly publicly vowed that a crackdown was coming. In particular, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">government focused</a> on “Antifa.” short for antifascist, is not an organization but rather an ideology that broadly describes a variety of left-leaning beliefs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men’s World Cup, compared with current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most fans</p>
<p>In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.</p>
<p>An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry">1.6% of sellable tickets</a> for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.</p>

      <p>As the year draws to a close, it's clear that the post-COVID hiring bonanza has ended, and job-hunting has gotten trickier. Experts are predicting next year to be marked by more of the same: a low-hire, low-fire labor market. Plus, the Nasdaq asks the SEC for permission to allow close to 24/7 trading, and a federal appeals court is blocking the firing of most workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>

The agreement covers all aspects of trade, but the most controversial area is agriculture. Farmers have been protesting because they fear a glut of cheap imports. Then, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever roadmap for tackling a Europe-wide housing affordability crisis earlier this week. We'll discuss it with the EU's housing Commissioner.</p>

<p>Canadians under 35 missed credit payments at higher rates in the third quarter than they did at the same time last year, and they're seeking debt relief services in higher numbers, as living costs are outpacing wages. The popularity of &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plans could be making the problem worse. CBC's Jenna Benchetrit explains</p>

<p>Venezuela's bitumen-heavy oil is virtually identical to Canada's and the South American country has the largest proven reserves in the world. But Venezuelan oil has essentially disappeared from world markets over the past 20 years. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to invade Venezuela have opened up the prospect that it could one day return, with huge implications for Canada.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The defensive end’s pursuit of the NFL sack record defies belief, raising questions about what his perpetually rebuilding team should do about it</p>
<p>The NFL sack record is one of those hallowed figures in professional sports. Michael Strahan’s 22.5 lingered for two decades not because pass rushers failed to get better, but because everything has to break just right for someone to reach it. You need volume. You need game scripts. You need offenses chasing points. When TJ Watt finally tied it in 2021, it felt like he had reached the outer limit. The record had been touched, but not broken.</p>
<p>Myles Garrett has spent this season treating that assumption with contempt. Now, he’s a couple of plays away from history.</p>

      <p>Search engines, social media, e-commerce, and mobile games all make money by selling advertising. But making ads work in AI search might not be so straight forward. Perplexity, for instance, reportedly pulled back on plans to integrate ads into their AI search engine. And internal documents showed the company made only $20,000 in ad revenue in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Garrett Johnson, professor of marketing at Boston University to get a sense of why jumping into the ad business is difficult.</p>

      <p>Hegseth announcement comes day after Trump blockades all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela</p>
<p>The US military carried out a lethal strike on a vessel it said was engaged in drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific, according to the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as Trump further ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela, accusing the country of taking US oil.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Hegseth said the “lethal kinetic strike” on a vessel engaged in “narco-trafficking operations” had killed four people. The latest strike in the Pacific brings the death toll to 99 since the US began its campaign of striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in September.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Official response to lawsuit filed by victims’ relatives admits FAA and army failures played role in Washington DC crash</p>
<p>The US government admitted on Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration and the army played a role in causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/aircraft-crash-ronald-reagan-airport-virginia">the collision in January</a> between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter near the nation’s capital, killing 67 people in the deadliest crash on American soil in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The official response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims’ families said that the government is liable in the crash partly because the air traffic controller violated procedures about when to rely on pilots to maintain visual separation that night. Plus, the filing said, the army helicopter pilots’ “failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid” the airline jet makes the government liable.</p>

      <p>Two bills mark first time Congress votes over national care bans and escalation of anti-trans rhetoric</p>
<p>The House on Wednesday night passed a bill introduced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marjorie-taylor-greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, a Republican, to criminalize parents and providers for providing gender-affirming care to children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>The bill, one of two scheduled for a vote this week targeting gender-affirming healthcare for children, marks the most significant attempt by federal lawmakers to restrict the healthcare for children in the US.</p>

<p>“Rates of heart attacks in January 2025 actually surpassed heart attack rates during all the prior Januaries, even during the Covid years,” Dr Susan Cheng, director of public health research at Cedars-Sinai and the study’s senior author, told the Guardian.</p>
<p>This story was amended on 17 December 2025 to correct a misprint in the journal study. The was a 118% increase in blood-test abnormalities after the January wildfires.</p>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The Senate has given final passage to an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs. The legislation is attempting to overhaul how the Pentagon purchases weapons and pressures Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela. The annual National Defense Authorization Act also raises troop pay by 3.8%. However, the legislation includes some pushback on recent moves by the Pentagon. Several Republican senators back Hegseth and his decision not to release the video publicly. Democrats call for part of the video to be released publicly and for every member of Congress to have access to the full footage.</p>

      <h1>Fani Willis defends Trump prosecution at contentious Georgia hearing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>Fulton county DA hits back at Republican opponents who investigated her over relationship with special prosecutor</p>
<p>Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis testified on Wednesday at a combative Georgia state senate committee about her prosecution of Donald Trump for election interference.</p>
<p>The state senate created the special committee in early 2024 to investigate Willis after the revelation that she had a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, special prosecutor in the Trump case, which ultimately derailed the prosecution of the now-re-elected president.</p>

      <p>New plaques on ‘Presidential Walk of Fame’ scorn ‘divisive’ Obama and ‘by far the worst’ Biden – but Reagan is praised</p>
<p>White House officials on Wednesday revised what they call the “Presidential Walk of Fame,” installing plaques beneath portraits of former presidents that reflect Donald Trump’s own views, including branding former president Joe Biden as “the worst president in American history”.</p>
<p>The changes are part of Trump’s broader effort to reshape the White House environment to match his preferences. Along the colonnade, portraits of past presidents now feature expanded text that permanently records Trump’s assessments of their records.</p>

<p>Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House judiciary committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the justice department, and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s investigation and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami re-signs Luis Suárez for 2026 season after winning MLS Cup</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona striker, who turns 39 in January, has been productive but was benched for the tail end of Miami’s title run</p>
<p>Inter Miami have re-signed striker Luis Suárez through the 2026 season, the MLS Cup champions announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The legendary Uruguay international had 17 goals and 17 assists in 50 appearances for the team in 2025. However, Inter Miami became a buzzsaw after Suárez was dropped to the bench by head coach Javier Mascherano. Replaced by Mateo Silvetti after Miami’s 2-1 loss at Nashville SC in Round One, Miami won their next four games and outscored opponents 16-2 in route to the MLS Cup title.</p>

      <h1>Susie Wiles interview might be a useful distraction from how poorly things are going for Americans</h1>

      <p>
      <p>The incendiary quotes don’t disguise how dissatisfied people are about jobs, inflation or the cost of living</p>

</ul>
<p>So it appears Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, agrees with many of us: she thinks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/susie-wiles-trump-interview">Donald Trump’s cabinet is bonkers</a>.</p>
<p>From that bombshell Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1">interview</a>, which featured some <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/693b2a465fd632c8d81d318f/master/w_1600,c_limit/202602-portfolio-embed02%20(1).jpg">truly terrifying</a> close-up photos, we learned that Wiles considers JD Vance to have been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade”. She believes Elon Musk to be an “odd, odd duck”. Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, is, in Wiles’ view, “a right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>
<p>“If we’re judging by these numbers, Americans are completely dissatisfied with the way things are happening in this country.”</p>

<p>Three nursing home residents died because employees of the American healthcare giant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/unitedhealth-nursing-homes-payments-hospital-transfers">UnitedHealth Group</a> helped delay or deny them critical hospital care, two pending lawsuits and a complaint to state authorities have alleged.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Community members have stepped up with carpools, food deliveries, school patrols and policy advocacy</p>
<p>Before the school bell rang on the morning of 19 November, dozens of parents – mostly dads – huddled outside schools all around Durham, North Carolina. Bleary-eyed from late-night meetings and dinging group chats, they passed out whistles and gloves before dispersing to stand along school perimeters.</p>
<p>The parents had formed ad hoc welcoming committees for students being dropped off for school – and to serve as a united group of watchdogs against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). A week before Thanksgiving, federal immigration agents had descended upon the city as part of a massive statewide campaign that included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/activists-immigration-charlotte-north-carolina">Charlotte</a> and smaller communities. For almost a month, masked agents, often in tactical vests or fatigues and some <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/12/05/ice-agents-once-again-operating-in-north-carolina-activists-say-including-arrests-in-durham/">carrying rifles</a>, patrolled quiet neighborhoods and vibrant shopping centers around North Carolina. ICE <a href="https://www.wunc.org/race-class-communities/2025-12-12/ice-arrests-nc-criminal-record-triangle-customs-border-patrol">doubled its North Carolina arrests</a> in 2025 from the previous year, totaling 3,400 arrests from 20 January through 15 October.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/trump-orders-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela">ordered “a total and complete” blockade</a> of all oil tankers under sanctions from entering and leaving Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p><strong>What has Trump said?</strong> In a post on social media last night announcing the blockade, Trump alleged Venezuela was using oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes and vowed to escalate the military buildup. “Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the shooting?</strong> A person dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people</a> and wounded nine others at Brown during final exams.</p>

      <h1>Backlash prompts slashed World Cup ticket prices</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> FIFA has said it will release <span class="math inline">\(60 seats for next year's World Cup, following complaints from fans over high prices.

      <h1>Maga loyalist expands investigation into intelligence officials who angered Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others</p>
<p>A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.</p>
<p>Former prosecutors and legal experts call the Miami-based inquiry, which has issued some two dozen subpoenas so far, a “fishing expedition”. The investigation’s apparent focus is to identify ways to criminally charge ex-FBI and intelligence officials who have already been investigated and effectively exonerated by two special counsels and a Republican-led Senate panel, which mounted exhaustive inquiries into Russia’s efforts to boost Trump in 2016.</p>

      <p>A career in tech was once seen as a safe bet — the jobs were plentiful, the pay was ample. But this year the tech sector had another “meh” year for hiring according to the job site Indeed. Tech jobs have been declining now for several years, but this year, the losses at least seemed to stabilize, according to Indeed's latest Jobs &amp; Hiring Trends Report. Still, job postings in the industry remain well below their pre-pandemic baseline.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Indeed senior economist Cory Stahle for a look at how this year turned out for the tech job market.</p>

<p>A Calgary woman accused of sending five emails that threatened former Alberta justice minister Jonathan Denis, his mother and several of his friends has seen those charges dropped after evidence was revealed in court that one of the emails was sent through an email-spoofing website based in the Czech Republic and police determined the other four were “not authentic.”</p>

<p>The Australian classification review board has overturned a decision to block Australians seeing footage of the shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media after Elon Musk’s X appealed against the ruling sought by the eSafety commissioner.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/charlie-kirk-murder-suspect-court-appearance">Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University</a> on 10 September, the eSafety commissioner applied to the board to have video of the shooting classified in Australia. The video was ruled to be “refused classification”, which allowed eSafety to serve notices on social media platforms ordering them to geo-block the posts from view for Australia-based users.</p>

<p>Wiles also said she had told <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that his second term was not supposed to be a retribution tour.</p>
<p>“ <strong>We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over</strong>,” she said in an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-2">interview</a> in March.</p>
<p>I mean, people could think <strong>it</strong> <em><strong>does</strong></em> <strong>look vindictive</strong>. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t think he [Trump] wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it</strong>.</p>
<p>Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.</p>

      <p>The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to 4.6% in November, according to the latest BLS jobs report. There’s also data showing more Americans are reentering the workforce and more part-time workers are looking for full-time roles.

      <p>Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate</p>
<p>Downing Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79x54dprngo">BBC reported</a> on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.</p>
<p>The agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/business/economy/trump-uk-trade-deal-tariffs.html">New York Times first reported</a> British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Van Hollen go after tech firms including Google and Amazon</p>
<p>Three Democratic US senators announced Tuesday that they are investigating whether big tech companies are passing the soaring utility costs of “energy-guzzling” data centers on to ordinary Americans. The trio sent letters to the heads of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta as well as the data center operators CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix asking for greater transparency, cost-sharing and accountability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut wrote that they were alarmed by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">reports</a> that these data centers caused residential electricity bills to “skyrocket”. Regions with significant data center activity have already endured price increases <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">by as much as 267%</a> over the past five years, the three lawmakers wrote. According to the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency, the average cost of a US family’s electricity bill had risen 7% year-over-year as of September.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)

      <p>The BBC has vowed to defend itself against the $10bn lawsuit that the US president, Donald Trump, filed against it. Trump alleges the broadcaster “intentionally, maliciously and deceptively” edited the 6 January speech he gave before the attack on the US Capitol. On Tuesday, a BBC spokesperson said: “As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”</p>

With many Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidies set to expire, coverage is about to get even more pricier for more than 20 million people next year.

      <p>
      <p>From LA to Charlotte, organizers are learning from others’ strategies to protect residents amid federal crackdowns</p>
<p>When Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) set its sights on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> in September, Chicagoans sprang into action to protect their immigrant neighbors: teaching each other how to recognize and safely document ICE agents, setting up “know your rights” trainings, and distributing whistles en masse so people could loudly alert anyone in the vicinity when ICE was spotted.</p>
<p>In the months since, whistles have become a popular raid alert tool in other cities across the country – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New Yorkers</a> wear them around their necks to warn neighbors, the people of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> blast them outside ICE facilities and Charlotte residents used them to ward off Customs and Border Protection officials. While strongly associated with Chicago, the tactic is actually one that city organizers learned in part from groups in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit">suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech</a> he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>On what basis is Trump suing?</strong> He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>
<p><strong>What roadblocks remain to a deal?</strong> The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?</strong> He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.</p>

      <p>The Zen-like US representative from Minnesota has had the highest level of death threats of any congressperson because of the president’s attacks</p>
<p>“That’s Teddy,” said Tim Mynett, husband of the US representative Ilhan Omar, as their five-year-old labrador retriever capered around her office on Capitol Hill. “If you make too much eye contact, he’ll lose it. He’s my best friend – and he’s our security detail these days.”</p>
<p>The couple were sitting on black leather furniture around a coffee table. Apart from a sneezing fit that took her husband by surprise, Omar had an unusual Zen-like calm for someone who receives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMJuCtlxe0M">frequent death threats</a> and is the subject of a vendetta from the most powerful man in the world.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Since Trump’s second term began in January, global healthcare, especially for sexual and reproductive health, has been under constant attack</p>
<p>This time last year, women’s rights organisations were bracing themselves for a second Trump term. Few were prepared for the chaos that would be unleashed in January. The volume and speed of executive orders coming out of the White House were seen as a deliberate tactic to overwhelm and create panic. In many ways it worked – there was confusion, anger and exhaustion as organisations scrambled to fill the gap left by the USAID freeze. But that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The US administration has been the key driver, supported by intense advocacy work by ultra-conservative groups using the moment to strengthen global ties with political allies.</p>

      <h1>How states are competing in the data center gold rush</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Tech giants are estimated to have spent almost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/tech-ai-spending-company-valuations-7b92104b">$400 billion</a> in capital expenditures this year, mostly to build data centers for artificial intelligence. A single massive facility can have a price tag in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And many states want in on that spending spree. Thirty-seven states have some sort of incentive program to attract data centers with the hope of bringing a boost to their local economies. They're giving away hundreds of millions in tax exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Nicholas Miller, policy associate at NCSL, to learn more.</p>

      <h1>How do chain restaurants offer unlimited pasta in this economy?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Inflation, rising food prices and the high cost of living have been top of mind for consumers all year. But then Olive Garden offers an unlimited pasta meal, or a chain steakhouse restaurant sells a steak dinner with two sides for less than 30 bucks. So, how are chains able to keep prices as low as they do in this economy?</p>

      <h1>Joshua v Paul makes Joe Louis’ ‘Bum of the Month’ look like the Rumble in the Jungle | Sean Ingle</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>The best we can hope for is that Paul does not get seriously hurt. Joshua, Netflix and the sport itself should know better</p>
<p>Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.</p>
<p>“McCoy was expected to crumple under the first punch Louis tossed in his direction,” the New York Times’ correspondent wrote. “Instead, the wily New England veteran made Louis appear ludicrous at times. Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out. Louis had won, but only his bank balance had been enhanced.</p>

      <h1>Ford takes $19.5bn hit amid electric vehicle retreat as Trump policies bite</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Company to scrap several electric models and focus on gas and hybrid as US president pulls support for EVs</p>
<p>Ford said on Monday it will take a $19.5bn writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand.</p>
<p>Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an Erev, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s post on Rob Reiner sparks outrage from lawmakers and celebrities</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>President’s statement blaming acclaimed director’s death on his dislike of him described as ‘disgusting’ and ‘vile’</p>
<p>Celebrities and lawmakers from both of the US’s major political parties are condemning Donald Trump after the president blamed the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/rob-reiner-obituary">Rob Reiner</a> on what he described as the acclaimed Hollywood director’s dislike of him.</p>
<p>After the apparent killings of Reiner, 78, and his 68-year-old wife, Michele, who were found dead at their home Sunday in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, Trump took to social media to call the director “tortured and struggling”. Trump also claimed Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME”.</p>

      <p>Danny Ceisler’s defeat in sheriff’s race of incumbent who had signed an agreement to work with ICE sends a message on US’s contentious debate around immigration policy</p>
<p>Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.</p>
<p>Party registration in the county is <a href="https://www.buckscounty.gov/186/Voter-Statistics">almost evenly split</a> among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.</p>

<p>A member of the Canadian military intelligence community accused of leaking sensitive information to a foreign entity has been released from military police custody. Master Warrant Officer Matthew Robar faces eight charges in connection with unspecified alleged incidents last year.</p>

      <h1>China's economy hits a rough patch</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>There’s more evidence that China’s economy is stalling. Beijing released a batch of government data today that was not encouraging. Chinese consumers have slammed their wallets shut, and data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China paints a picture of stagnating investment, output, and consumption. And later, we'll preview long-delayed economic data slated to come out this week and learn why retailers are hiring fewer workers for the holiday shopping season.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>Spurs have faced low moments in their history, and this is one of them. How will the club respond in the post-Daniel Levy era?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ablink.editorial.theguardian.com/ss/c/u001.Yw_JkLMEmFuifc_XG18IRyTNtZQ7fIEMgszcCSneHEDdU1IxeDnOTgt6YHM8QyEWtqwpwSAHqn42W48e4lxhBcsjq2l2fkD4Y3L_bu6RBiJlxQgq6_DSnF5EmWfvJBXTqDleBNB7wtd_nSQ4AjIqtHKOcZQ6oRa7-Zq2fzE-XB8-C99jekmBKhbC18w1ufpNxKwgUWEgFKGAM3GhkswV6H0EMPNxkWi7VSfwJps-fm0Il4FJK4JplOdKTl6nH9ug6HkDJsBXWZeXZWx6H1TQ4Ow7WGSYJrgJqeTc7d65F7-FOOOY0bLi6vLPIf31rPG01EQh59t0Y8bIPVibUJcVdZTIENDi3oVwAuk76dT6ctI-kQRhw8Ik0IQPoiBz97Oqe4Wdy6iL03ONC-8XcRuJ9A/4l3/YffwdCt2Qe-WVW351zs7xw/h7/h001.6ZKqI8iNPRrEcm32Jn4a3VTlyzfHwvlEUtF6tUBcP0M"><strong>Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/14/nottingham-forest-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest</a>, are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).</p>
<p>Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">leaves them 11th</a>, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.</p>

      <h1>Brown University shooting: what we know so far about the attack in Providence, Rhode Island</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released</p>
<p>Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p><strong>A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day</strong>. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. <strong>The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A shooter dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University</a> during final exams</strong> on the Ivy League campus.</p>
<p><strong>Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students</strong>. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital</strong>, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.</p>
<p><strong>Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,</strong> praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.</p>
<p><strong>The two slain have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims">identified</a> by loved ones as</strong> <strong>Ella Cook</strong> <strong>, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and</strong> <strong>MukhammadAziz Umurzokov</strong> <strong>, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.</strong> Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.</p>
<p><strong>The university <a href="https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy">announced</a> that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.</strong> A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.</strong> An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.</p>
<p><strong>The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.</strong> Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”</p>
<p><strong>The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department</strong>. According to the university’s website, the building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices. Brown, one of the America’s most prestigious colleges, has roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>This week, the Senate is set to take up the $900 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed it last week. It is more than 3,000 pages of defense policy planning that the Senate will be digging through; the actual funding of these plans comes later. But there's also a whole lot of stuff that's not defense-related. Today, we'll dig in. Plus, we'll hear how China came to dominate in money laundering.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump posted during his first term on what was then called Twitter, his attacks and rants differed significantly from US federal agency staff’s more cautious and traditional approach on social media.</p>
<p>For example, in January 2017, in response to scrutiny of one of the president’s executive orders, the Department of <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/825864341190750208">Homeland Security (DHS) posted</a>: “We are &amp; will remain in compliance with judicial orders.

<p>Phoenix trailed 99-79 with 7:48 left, but took a 114-113 lead with 12.2 seconds left on Dillon Brooks’s three-pointer over James, who made contact with Brooks after the shot. Brooks bumped James on the way back down the court, earning his second technical foul and an ejection.</p>
<p>More importantly, it gave the Lakers a free throw, but James missed the shot. On the ensuing possession, James was fouled on a three-point attempt by Devin Booker with 3.9 seconds left. The 40-year-old James – who finished with 26 points – missed the first free throw but made the final two to give the Lakers a 115-114 lead. Phoenix’s Grayson Allen got up an awkward shot at the buzzer, but it was blocked by James.</p>

</ul>
<p>A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.</p>
<p>The disclosure was made at a hastily convened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&amp;t=908">late night news conference</a> to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”</p>
<p>The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.</p>

      <p>In at least half a dozen states, librarians have joined forces with civil rights groups to oppose book bans, often facing personal and professional repercussions</p>
<p>For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.</p>
<p>“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”</p>

<p>It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place. Murders, once rare, now seemed to be happening almost every month, shootings every other week, and in a city of just over 10,000 people, that violence felt close, the losses personal. The victims and perpetrators were predominantly Black, usually young and too often cousins, neighbors or the children of friends, people whom Daniels would see around, until suddenly they were gone.</p>

<p><strong>Were either known to the authorities?</strong> Naveed Akram was examined by security agencies in October 2019 because of his alleged associations with others, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0">He said</a> the alleged shooters were not thought to be “part of a wider [terrorist] cell”.</p>
<p><strong>Are gun laws being discussed?</strong> Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.</p>

<p><strong>What have the police said?</strong> The LAPD’s chief detective, Alan Hamilton, said the investigation was ongoing. “At this time, the LAPD is not seeking anyone as a suspect or as a person of interest … and we will not be doing that until we conduct our investigation and we move forward.”</p>

      <p>The Colts quarterback was coaching high school football before his surprise return. And he showed brains are almost important as brawn at his position</p>
<p>Is quarterback <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers-playbooks-nfl-quarterback">the most demanding position in sports</a>? It’s close enough to make no difference: players must memorize a complicated playbook, orchestrate an entire offense, scan for open receivers while 280lb opponents sprint toward them with violent intent, and then thread a pass to a target who could be 30 yards downfield amid a crowd of defenders. Now try doing all that as a 44-year-old grandfather, exactly 1,800 days since you last started an NFL game.</p>
<p>Philip Rivers broke a historic streak for the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. The longest layoff between games before then belonged to another 44-year-old quarterback who returned to action after years out of the game, and some time in coaching – Steve DeBerg for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998.</p>

<p>Brown University students were told that all remaining classes and exams for the semester would be delayed after the shooting that killed two people and left several others injured.</p>
<p>In a note to students, the university’s provost, <strong>Francis J Doyle III</strong>, said the decision was made “out of our profound concern for all students, faculty and staff on our campus”. He encouraged students and staff to focus on their safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus. Students are free to leave if they are able. Students who remain will have access to on-campus services and support.</p>
<p>At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now. University leaders are committed to providing care and mobilizing resources to assist our community members through this difficult time.</p>

      <p>End of subsidies after failed legislation will have serious and damaging impact on entire sector, policy experts say</p>
<p>With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.</p>
<p>The average amount ACA plan enrollees pay annually for premiums is estimated to more than double, from an average of <span class="math inline">\(888 this year to \)</span>1,904 in 2026, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">KFF analysis</a>.</p>

      <p>In an economy that rewards confession and self-labeling, pain is no longer something to survive – but something to brand, sell, and curate</p>
<p>In March 2023, Dr Gabor Maté, a retired family physician and among the most respected trauma experts in the world, boldly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/the-trauma-doctor-gabor-mate-on-happiness-hope-and-how-to-heal-our-deepest-wounds">diagnosed</a> Prince Harry with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), during a live interview.</p>

These were not evidence of disease per se, Maté went on to elaborate. Rather, he said: “I see it as a normal response to abnormal stress.”</p>

<p>Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.</p>
<p>The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.</p>

<p>Trey Sherman was traveling to work on the New York subway when he received an email from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/07/bari-weiss-cbs-news-remake/">David Reiter</a>, a CBS News executive, about an imminent meeting on 29 October. Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html">more than 2,000 jobs</a> as part of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.</p>

<p>A Native American tribe in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas">Kansas</a> is facing criticism from other tribal groups after its economic development subsidiary secured a $29.9m federal contract from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to design potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> detention facilities.</p>
<p>The development entity of <a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/">the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation</a> signed the contract to design the detention facilities in October, leading to criticism that the tribal group, which was uprooted from the Great Lakes region to reservation lands north of Topeka, Kansas, in the 1830s, was itself benefiting from forced removals under the Trump administration.</p>

As a result of the nonstop rain, mudslides tore through communities, washing away homes and stranding families on rooftops as they waited for rescue.</p>

      <h1>Two girls, 9 and 11, awarded $31.5m after sister’s California torture death</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>Arabella McCormack, 11, died after being tortured and starved by adoptive family and police and church failed to intervene</p>
<p>A lawsuit over the death of an 11-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> girl who was allegedly tortured and starved by her adoptive family reached a settlement on Friday totaling $31.5m from the city and county of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-diego">San Diego</a> as well as other groups.</p>
<p>The suit was brought on behalf of the two younger sisters of Arabella McCormack, who died in August 2022. The girls were ages six and seven at the time. Their adoptive mother, Leticia McCormack, and McCormack’s parents, Adella and Stanley Tom, are facing charges of murder, conspiracy, child abuse and torture. They pleaded not guilty to all charges, and their criminal case is ongoing.</p>

      <p>Dense, 450-mile-long fog bank lingering over central valley as experts blames unusual combination of weather factors</p>
<p>New Nasa satellite images reveal the scope of central California’s dreary December, caused by an enormous fog formation that has been haunting the Central Valley for weeks, trapping residents in colder-than-usual temperatures.</p>
<p>The low cloud formation, known as tule fog, first formed over central California in November and persisted into early December. The Central Valley typically sees this type of fog during the colder months of the year, when the air near the ground is cold and moist, and the winds are calmer, allowing moisture in the air to transform into a thick layer of fog.</p>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>After Trump ended key repayment plan, 40% of borrowers say their student loans make it harder to cover essentials</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://ticas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DFP-Topline-Polling-Results_12.3.25.pdf">survey</a> found that a whopping 40% of student loan borrowers say that their loans have negatively affected their ability to cover their basic needs, such as food, housing and transportation – a financial burden that becomes even more apparent around the holiday season.</p>
<p>At first glance, someone like Ben L should not be struggling financially. He attended Georgetown University and Columbia University for his undergraduate and graduate degrees, respectively, and now earns a six-figure salary working at a biotech company. Still, the 36-year-old is drowning in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/student-debt-us">student debt</a>.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Wild made an all-in move for one of the NHL’s best players in his prime, acquiring defenseman Quinn Hughes from the Vancouver Canucks in a blockbuster trade – their boldest action yet toward ending a decade-long skid of playoff series defeats.</p>
<p>The teams announced the seismic move on Friday night, after the 2024 Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman had been the most talked-about trade candidate over the past couple of weeks. Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.</p>

<p>Two burrowing owls stowed away on a cruise ship out of Miami, and are now living the high life at a Spanish resort before returning to the US next month.</p>
<p>Biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said the mating pair boarded Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas before the vessel’s transatlantic crossing to Cartagena in southern Spain in February. The tiny owls, a threatened species in Florida, usually prefer more rural landscapes, and may have been spooked by all the concrete around the Port of Miami, they say.</p>

      <h1>The Trump administration keeps picking fights with pop stars. It’s a no-win situation | Adrian Horton</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-bait</p>
<p>Last week, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.</p>
<p>Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/15/taylor-swift-silence-trump-administration-speaks-volumes">appearing as if you condone</a> the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and Clemens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>With Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still matters</p>
<p>Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball">would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban">explained his specious reasonings behind it</a>, last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.</p>
<p>Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball">died in September 2024</a>, Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.</p>

      <h1>Floridians feel the impacts of climate change</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>Florida is a state that often feels tangible impacts of climate change, with strong storms and hurricanes making landfall in the state every hurricane season. However, this year is the first time in a decade that the Sunshine State was spared from experiencing a single hurricane. Jessica Meszaros, a climate change reporter at WUSF, joins Kimberly to explain how Floridians are rebuilding a year after hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton hit the state.

(date: 2025-12-12)

      <p>The report, based on documents obtained by the New York Times, says it’s unclear how many arrests have been made due to this data sharing</p>
<p>The admiral in charge of US military forces in Latin America will retire two years early, AP reports, amid rising tensions with <strong>Venezuela</strong> that include Wednesday’s seizure of an oil tanker and more than 20 deadly strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats.</p>
<p>Three US officials and two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Admiral <strong>Alvin Holsey</strong> was pushed out by defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>. Two officials said Hegseth had grown frustrated with Southern Command as he sought to flex US military operations and planning in the region.</p>

      <p>
      <p>While markets are mellowing a bit, three major stock indexes closed at record highs on Thursday. Reminder: The stock market is not the economy! But it still can tell us how investors — and by association, high-income Americans — are feeling about the future. In this episode, who wins when the stock market performs well. Plus: Old MacDonald has a ... drone? And we check-in with three retailers around the U.S. about the holiday shopping season.</p>

      <p>National Trust looks to halt construction, claiming Trump tore down historic East Wing without needed permission</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is facing a federal lawsuit seeking to halt construction on his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/trump-ballroom-architect">$300m White House ballroom</a>, with historic preservationists accusing the president of violating multiple federal laws by tearing down part of the iconic building without required reviews or congressional approval.</p>
<p>The legal challenge, <a href="https://savingplaces.org/nthp-complaint-20251212">filed on Friday</a> by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the US district court for the District of Columbia, represents the most significant attempt yet to stop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/what-is-the-white-house-east-wing-and-why-has-it-been-torn-down-in-trumps-renovation-plans">Trump’s 90,000-sq-ft</a> addition to the White House complex. The organization is seeking a temporary restraining order to freeze all construction activities until proper federal oversight procedures are completed.</p>

<p>Smith is scheduled to appear next week for a behind-closed-door deposition with the Republican-led committee, where he may discuss his investigation into allegations that Trump took classified materials to his properties and then hid them from federal authorities.

      <h1>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric</p>
<p>For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “ <a href="https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/">the dependency trap</a>”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.</p>

      <h1>Indiana’s rejection of new voting map shows Trump’s might is not unlimited</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>Defeat complicates the picture for Republicans across the US as they seek to redraw districts in an increasingly messy battle</p>
<p>The Indiana legislature’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejection</a> of a new map that would have added two Republican seats in Congress marked one of the biggest political defeats for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> so far in his second term and significantly damaged the Republican effort to reconfigure congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The defeat showed that Trump’s political might is not unlimited. For months, the president waged an aggressive effort to twist the arms of Indiana lawmakers into supporting a new congressional map, sending JD Vance to meet in person with lawmakers. Trump allies also set up outside groups to pressure state lawmakers.</p>

<p>A federal judge on Friday morning issued a temporary restraining order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kilmar-abrego-garcia">Kilmar Ábrego García</a> just hours before he was scheduled to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) field office in Baltimore.</p>
<p>His lawyers asked the judge to block authorities from detaining him again. The judge says officials cannot re-detain him until the court conducts a hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>With ICE targeting vendors and fear rising, community groups are organising fast to keep New Yorkers working on the streets safe</p>
<p>On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables. Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of immigration raids across the city.</p>
<p>“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights information.”</p>

      <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year — and with that, the obligatory office holiday party. Thing is, some choices around holiday parties can tell a story of how a company is doing. Who's there? Who's chatting together or sticking to a corner? What food and drink are being served? Today, we'll help you read the room. But first, most regional Federal Reserve bank presidents have been reappointed, despite some Trump administration proposals to exert greater control over the Fed's regional banks.</p>

<p>Immigration agents appear to be increasingly arresting and detaining Afghan asylum seekers, especially men, who have arrived in the US recently and are awaiting court hearings to decide their cases.</p>
<p>Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.</p>

      <p>Measure to add two GOP-friendly seats failed 19-31 after 21 Republicans joined 10 Democrats. Plus, how the Paris climate treaty changed the world</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Indiana Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines</a> on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.</p>
<p><strong>How might the administration react to the vote?</strong> Heritage Action, the advocacy branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted on social media: “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”</p>
<p><strong>What are Democrats doing on redistricting?</strong> They’ve retaliated to the initial push by Texas to add five more likely Republican seats by redrawing maps in California.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been pushback to Trump’s escalation?</strong> Yes – after the US seized a tanker named the Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, some US lawmakers expressed concern that Trump was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker">“sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.</a></p>

      <h1>Reddit fights Australia's social media ban</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Reddit has filed a lawsuit calling for Australia's social media ban for children under 16 to be declared invalid. The text-based forum is one of 10 online platforms covered by the ban, which came into force this week. And later in the program, we head to Peru, where conflicts are brewing over how money from Machu Picchu tickets is being spent and whether it's benefiting tourists and locals.</p>

      <h1>Trinity Rodman: why US soccer could lose its most compelling star to Europe</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The forward’s blocked contract and a growing talent drain to Europe have nudged the NWSL into crisis mode. Here’s what’s happening and why it matters</p>
<p>The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women’s Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.</p>
<p>Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL’s future. Yet European giants have offered her salaries that America’s top women’s domestic league cannot legally match, prompting the NWSL <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/trinity-rodman-s-multimillion-dollar-contract-rejected-by-nwsl">to veto a record-breaking Washington Spirit deal</a> (and the players’ union <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/12/05/nwslpa-files-grievance-for-trinity-rodman-due-to-leagues-veto-of-spirit-contract-extension/">to file a grievance</a> in response).</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: Patriots and Bills battle in AFC East as Rivers runs it back</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The AFC East rivals face off in a game that could decide their conference’s top seed, while a familiar face may return for the Colts</p>
<p>There is some serious debate that could run over this week’s top-shelf matchup. The Rams, the NFC’s current No 1 seeds, are welcoming the Lions, who claimed top seed in the conference last season. The Denver Broncos, the AFC leaders, host the Green Bay Packers who still have a shot at a first-round bye in the NFC. Either way you go you won’t be disappointed. Only there is a third way: Buffalo v New England. The emphasis is on the bounty that winning brings rather than the perils of defeat on Sunday. The Patriots can wrestle back the AFC’s No 1 seed while Buffalo can give themselves a shot at snatching the AFC East title from New England. Oh, and two MVP candidates in Drake Maye and Josh Allen are running the show. It could be a classic.</p>

<p>More than 50 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/us-veterans-affairs-database-immigration">the Guardian revealed</a> the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.</p>

<p>Every U.S. president releases a national security strategy document about a year into their term, but few have made as big a splash as Donald Trump's, earlier this month.
The document formally spells out much of what we've come to expect from Trump's approach to foreign policy in his second term: political relationships are transactional, and American interests take priority above all else. The document also takes particular aim at Europe, and pledges explicit support for right-wing movements abroad.
Bob Rae was, until recently, Canada's ambassador to the UN, following decades of political office including premier of Ontario. He reads between the document's lines and explains what it means for Canada — and asks how much of it is actually worth taking seriously.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s press secretary suggested Trump was growing weary of process as Ukraine’s president under immense pressure to sign US deal – key US politics stories from 11 December 2025</p>
<p>When it comes to Ukraine peace talks, Donald Trump is “sick of meetings just for the sake of meetings”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Leavitt added that the White House may send a representative to meet with European and Ukrainian officials this weekend if it feels like a meeting is “worthy” of the US’s time, adding that Trump is “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war”.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has exerted more pressure on Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro, expanding sanctions and issuing fresh threats to strike land targets in Venezuela, as the South American dictator accused the US president of ushering in a new “era of criminal naval piracy” in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday, the US imposed curbs on three nephews of Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, as well as six crude oil supertankers and the shipping companies linked to them. The treasury department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0332">alleged</a> the vessels “engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell’s latest presser was all about the job market. Buried among the usual talking points, like hiring sentiment and the unemployment rate, was immigration. That’s because the current administration’s immigration policies are complicating Fed measures of labor market health. In this episode, falling immigration turns jobs data on its head. Plus: Robust economic growth comes without typical job creation, U.S.-China trade tensions cool, and one company teaches AI to sort your trash.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">US Senate</a> on Thursday rejected competing proposals to address the imminent expiration of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans, greatly increasing the chances that healthcare costs will soon rise to unaffordable levels for millions of Americans.</p>
<p>The votes, part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">a deal</a> brokered between Republican majority leader John Thune and the Democratic senators who agreed to reopen the government after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline">historically long shutdown</a> last month, came as premium tax credits for an estimated 21.8 million enrollees of the plans are set to expire at the end of the month. Health policy research group KFF estimates that annual premiums will more than double if the subsidies are allowed to expire.</p>

      <p>US forces have seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure an act of international piracy.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny over a series of attacks on boats off the Venezuelan coast. At least 87 people have been killed in 22 known strikes since early September. Lucy Hough talks to the Guardian’s deputy head of international news, Devika Bhat</p>

<p>If you want to know what kind of winter to expect across much of Canada this winter, you’re out of luck — Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is predicting above-seasonal temperatures in the eastern Arctic region, but elsewhere, the forecast is pretty up in the air. That’s partly because of climate change and La Niña, experts say.</p>

The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Some warn proposal will decimate US tourism industry as free speech advocates say it will lead to people self-censoring</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have accused Donald Trump of “shredding civil liberties” and “censorship pure and simple” after the White House said it planned to require visa applicants from dozens of countries to provide social media, phone and email histories for vetting before being allowed into the US.</p>
<p>In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.</p>

Also on the show, we'll dig into the drone warfare industry, central to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Plus, are we past tariff inflation yet?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed the economic circumstances of many, creating demand for direct aid, interrupting consumer spending, and altering the nature of work. Today, there are people across the country in lockdown again — mixed-status immigrant families, who are experiencing disruptive economic pressures that mirror the pandemic. Today, we'll draw parallels. Plus, more people admit to stealing at self-checkouts. And, what can we expect from the Federal Reserve in 2026?</p>

      <h1>Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns</p>
<p>It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a>’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.</p>
<p>He excelled at <em>two</em> colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/25/shedeur-sanderss-first-round-nfl-draft">dramatic stock crashes</a> in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.</p>

<p>US forces have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong> <strong>, in all this?</strong> The Nobel peace prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway">greeted crowds in Oslo</a> after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.</p>
<p><strong>Do we know who sent the letters?</strong> It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Mexico’s parliament has voted in favor of a bill imposing tariffs of between 5% and 50% on more than 1,400 products from Asian nations, including China. Mexico states that the aim is to boost jobs and domestic production. Then, survivors of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim in Britain against the oil and gas giant Shell.

(date: 2025-12-11)

Longtime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesotans</a> said they had never seen the mall as quiet as it has been in recent days, almost jarringly still.</p>
<p>The bustle was replaced by unease and fear over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/trump-somalis-minneapolis-ice">menace</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/trump-somali-immigrants-minnesota">toward</a> Somalis and increased immigration agents in the city, tasked with targeting Somalis for deportation.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The AI boom is propelling a once-obscure group of state regulators into key decision-making roles for the economy. AI needs data centers, data centers need power and power is generally regulated in some way — depending on the state — by public utilities commissions.</p>
<p>That's the topic of a new report from the Center on Technology Policy at NYU. Scott Brennen, CTP director and author of the report, said these commissions often make decisions on planning and permitting for new infrastructure and decide the rates utilities charge consumers.</p>

<p>The Canadian Army will start to replace its entire stock of assault rifles, starting next year. Internal documents obtained by CBC News show a contract under the Canadian Modular Assault Rifle program is imminent. The deal is expected to boost production at a Canadian arms maker as part of the federal government’s drive to boost the defence industrial base.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a> voted 312-112 to pass a sweeping defense policy bill on Wednesday that authorizes $900bn in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">military</a> programs, including a pay raise for troops and an overhaul of how the Department of Defense purchases weapons.</p>
<p>The 3,000-page bill also includes a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/military-strikes-boats-drugs-caribbean-hegseth-congress-93c513e28f38688f5582150c7675c072">demand</a> for more information about nearly two dozen lethal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/visual-guide-us-military-presence-caribbean">boat strikes</a> in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug smugglers.

      <p>
      <p>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May</p>
<p>The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.</p>
<p>The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe">White House national security strategy</a> that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter point. That’s pretty much what analysts expected. But in other parts of the world, central banks have been signaling that they plan to hold rates steady or even hike them. In this global economy, why is the U.S. out of step? Also in this episode, we hear the pros and cons of quarterly earnings reports, check in on a union-run pipefitting apprenticeship and dig into why wage growth has slowed.</p>

<p>Donald Trump may not have won a Nobel peace prize, but last weekend he was at least given something: the inaugural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">Fifa peace prize</a>.</p>
<p>TheFifa prize’s existence was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">announced</a> remarkably soon after the Nobel went to Venezuelan opposition leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-corina-machado">María Corina Machado</a>. Gianni Infantino, the controversial Fifa president, has been toadying to Trump for years, so after he introduced the prize – in response to zero demand – it was little surprise that Trump got the trophy.</p>

      <p>Divisive vote to lower rates highlights uncertainty in the Fed as economy absorbs major shakeups, including tariffs</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it was cutting interest rates by a quarter point for the third time this year, as the embattled central bank appeared split over how best to manage the US economy.</p>
<p>The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.</p>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Lib Dems’ Gentleman Ed rips into Starmer for staying silent on The Donald’s US security strategy</p>
<p>With little more than a week to go until the Christmas recess, the Commons is in festive overdrive. Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose of PMQs at the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.</p>
<p>No one embraces the panto spirit more than Kemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni moved quickly on Wednesday to shut down the rising speculation around Jalen Hurts’ job security, calling talk of a potential quarterback change “ridiculous” despite his team’s three-game losing streak and their franchise star’s sudden dip in form.</p>
<p>Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl">Monday night’s 22-19 defeat</a> to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.</p>

      <p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Evoke decides to undertake a review of the Company’s strategic options</p>
<p><strong>European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.</strong></p>
<p>Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer <strong>Rheinmetall</strong> are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker <strong>BAE</strong> <strong>System</strong> has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.</p>
<p>Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.</p>
<p>Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.</p>

<p>Almost half of EU citizens regard Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/europeans-trump-enemy-of-europe-russia-war-poll">as an enemy of Europe</a>, a new survey across nine countries revealed last week. The poll, conducted for the French debate platform Le Grand Continent, found that across Europe, Trumpism is considered “a hostile force”.</p>
<p>The new US foreign policy doctrine published by the White House on Friday will have heightened these respondents’ worst fears. The 30-page National Security Strategy landed like a bombshell in Europe. And citizens may have been out in front of their political leaders in figuring out what Trump’s worldview could mean for Europeans.</p>

      <h1>Beware of shady refinance offers</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Today, the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter point. While there's no guarantee of it, the move could translate to lower mortgage rates, too. This presents an opportunity for bad actors to pitch homeowners something that might cost more than they’d think. Today, we discuss some &quot;too good to be true&quot; refinance opportunities. But first, Texas has launched the first state-run cryptocurrency reserve with a $5 million purchase of Bitcoin.</p>

There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy">ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months</a>, if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.</p>
<p><strong>Why hasn’t there been an election?</strong> Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he talk about?</strong> There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.</p>

      <p>RootsAction report finds Harris courted moderates instead of working-class Democrats – and Gaza stance did not help</p>
<p>Kamala Harris lost last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">US presidential election</a> because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.</p>
<p>The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by <a href="https://rootsaction.org/">RootsAction</a>.</p>

      <h1>‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressure</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>In 2010 and 2022, the US faced heightened emotions from the lead-in to the tournament itself. As hosts next year, little will change</p>
<p>The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.</p>
<p>With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.</p>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>The extended Black Friday sale season means a lot of people have been buying new TVs. The top sets today can display in up to 8K Ultra High Definition, they have deeper blacks, brighter highlights and are thinner and lighter-weight than ever. And yet, modern TVs have their haters — a dedicated group of purists who find them lacking, and would rather hunt down a good old fashioned used plasma.</p>

<p>US diplomats have been ordered to return to using the Times New Roman typeface in official communications, with secretary of state Marco Rubio calling the Biden administration’s decision to adopt Calibri a “wasteful” diversity move, according to an internal department cable seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The department under Rubio’s predecessor Antony Blinken switched to Calibri in 2023, claiming the modern sans-serif typeface was more accessible for people with disabilities because it did not have the decorative angular features and was the default in Microsoft products.</p>

<p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said that the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s announcement in the autumn budget that she would be more than doubling the UK’s financial headroom by 2030 from £9.9bn to £22bn had begun to assure bond markets about Labour’s fiscal approach.</p>

<p>The New York police department said Frederick Green, 20, was charged late Monday night. Police had revealed Monday that a “person of interest” was in custody but didn’t name them. It was not immediately clear if Green has an attorney. He also faces additional charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.</p>
<p>Boyd was shot in the abdomen just after 2am on 16 November in midtown Manhattan. Boyd, his friend and two other Jets’ players, Irvin Charles and Jamien Sherwood, had left a club and were approached by a group of men who made fun of their clothing, police told reporters at a news briefing.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Claressa Shields will defend her undisputed heavyweight championship in Detroit on 22 February, returning home for a rematch with Franchon Crews-Dezurn in her first fight since signing a landmark $8m promotional deal. The bout will headline a Dazn card at Little Caesars Arena, the home of the NBA’s Pistons and NHL’s Red Wings where Shields attracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/27/claressa-shields-fight-heavyweight-title-detroit">a near-sellout crowd for her most recent fight</a> last July.</p>
<p>Shields (17-0, 3 KO) and Crews-Dezurn (10-2, 2 KO) first met nearly a decade ago when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/19/claressa-shields-boxing-olympics-professional-debut-kovalev-ward">made their professional debuts against each other</a> on the undercard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/20/andre-ward-sergey-kovalev-boxing-points-decision-title-fight">Andre Ward’s victory over Sergey Kovalev</a> in 2016. Shields won a four-round unanimous decision that night in Las Vegas, a moment she still sees as formative. “I had just come off winning two Olympic gold medals, fresh out of the amateurs, and finding an opponent was tough,” she said in a press release announcing the fight. “Franchon stepped in. I’ve grown a lot since that first victory, but me and Franchon have unfinished business that needs to be settled.”</p>

<p>There was a mass exodus of lawyers earlier this year after political appointees removed career managers, detailed employees to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/civil-rights-division-doj-trump">menial work,</a> unilaterally dropped cases, and made it clear the division’s focus would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">enforcing</a> Donald Trump’s priorities. By 1 May of this year, the department had lost about 70% of its attorneys – a staggering number.

      <h1>Lionel Messi named 2025 MLS MVP, the second player to win award twice</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>Inter Miami star scored 29 goals with 19 assists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Messi won MLS Cup MVP in South Florida on Saturday</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a season in which he led Inter Miami to the club’s first MLS Cup, Lionel Messi has been named the Landon Donovan MLS Most Valuable Player for the 2025 season. League commissioner Don Garber made the announcement on Tuesday, capping a season in which Messi scored 29 goals with 19 assists in 28 appearances, one short of Carlos Vela’s record for goal contributions in a single season (though Vela’s was done in 31 games).</p>
<p>Messi joins Kansas City Wizards legend Preki as the only players to win the MVP award twice, with Messi being the first to win two such awards consecutively. At 38, Messi is not the oldest MVP in MLS history – that distinction also goes to Preki, who was the oldest MVP in the history of North American professional sports when he won the award at age 40 in 2003.</p>

      <h1>New York City braces for new casinos as gambling surge in US worries experts</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>Three proposed casinos approved as researchers say they take money from businesses and increase addiction</p>
<p>New York City will probably soon see three new casinos, whose owners could rake in profits because of a recent surge in gambling in the United States that has some campaigners worried.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> gaming facility location board last week approved three proposed casinos in the US’s largest city – two in Queens and one in the Bronx – after determining the businesses would create new jobs and generate billions in tax revenue, according to the <a href="https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/12/12.01.25.gflbselectiondocument.pdf">group’s report</a>.</p>
<p>This article was amended on 9 December 2025 to correct that the New York gaming facility location board approved the casinos last week, not this week as previously stated.</p>

      <h1>US civic health rating downgraded after year of ‘restrictive‘ Trump actions | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>Civicus, a nonprofit that monitors global civic freedoms, moved the US from the ‘narrowed’ to ‘obstructed’ category. Plus, the ‘gay wool’ taking over a New York catwalk</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-civic-health-rating-trump">downgraded the civic health rating of the US</a> from “narrowed” to “obstructed”.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> <strong>does it mean by “obstructed”?</strong> Countries where civic space is heavily contested – where civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them, including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.</p>
<p><strong>What’s holding up</strong> <strong>the European plan?</strong> Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn ($213bn) of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.</p>

      <h1>Kids in Australia are about to lose social media access</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A new law comes into force in Australia today, banning children under 16 from some of their favorite social media platforms, including Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram. And as you'd expect, most teens aren’t happy about it, though many parents see it as the government standing up to American Big Tech. Also, Nvidia is now authorized to sell advanced AI chips to China, and President Donald Trump says the U.S. government will be taking a 25% cut of sales.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Prosthetic limbs can be expensive, costing thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the industry seemed ripe for disruption when 3D printing came along. The technology requires little labor and uses economical materials. But the reality of 3D printing prosthetic limbs isn’t that straightforward, according to writer and University of California, Berkeley, lecturer Britt Young, who uses a prosthetic arm.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Young about why 3D printing has yet to bring down prosthesis costs.</p>

The turkey shortage didn't last for much longer after that as donations came in quickly.</p>

<p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has downgraded the United States’ civic health rating from “narrowed” to “obstructed.”</p>
<p>In a report released on Tuesday, Civicus, a non-profit that monitors civic freedoms in 198 countries, placed the US in its “obstructed” category. The group cited a “sharp deterioration of fundamental freedoms in the country … following a year of sweeping executive actions, restrictive laws and aggressive crackdowns on free speech and dissent.”</p>

<p>Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington have sued to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.</p>
<p>The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Kash Patel, the FBI director, because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with Donald Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on 4 June 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.</p>

      <p>President accuses neighbor of violating treaty governing water-sharing and urges water to be released ‘immediately’</p>
<p>Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 5% tariff on Mexico if it do not immediately provide additional water to help US farmers, accusing the country of violating a treaty that outlines water-sharing between the neighbors.</p>

      <h1>Trump confirms $12bn in assistance for American farmers amid concerns over trade and high prices – live</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>President says farmers are ‘the backbone of our country’ and says China has committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans</p>
<p><a href="http://mpdc.dc.gov/release/statement-chief-police-pamela-smith">In a statement</a>, <strong>Pamela Smith</strong> said she was “deeply humbled, grateful and deeply appreciative” of her time in her role, which she described as the “greatest honor” of her career. She gave thanks to the mayor for appointing her in 2023 and supporting her throughout her tenure, which she acknowledged had been both “challenging and rewarding”.</p>
<p>Smith adds that “tremendous progress” has been made but the city is not at “zero percent crime” yet.</p>
<p><em>I am confident that the department is in a strong position and that the great work will continue, moving in a positive trajectory to combat crime and enhance public safety. Washington, DC is an extraordinary place to live, visit, and work, and I remain inspired by the resilience and spirit of this community.</em></p>
<p><em>I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity as Chief of Police. It has been an honor to lead the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department, and I will always carry with the me the pride of having served this city.</em></p>
<p><em>When Chief Smith stepped up to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, we had no time to waste. She came in at a very challenging time for our community, when there was significant urgency to reverse the crime trends our city was facing post pandemic. Within a year of her tenure, we opened the Real-Time Crime Center.</em></p>
<p><em>We deployed newer and better technology. We worked with the Council to pass comprehensive legislation that prioritizes accountability. And Chief Smith got all of this done while also navigating unprecedented challenges and attacks on our city’s autonomy.</em></p>

<p>The US supreme court on Monday appeared poised to back the Trump administration’s argument that the president should be able to fire independent board members that for almost a century have been protected from presidential interference.</p>
<p>The court heard arguments concerning the legality of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and appeared to be split down partisan lines in favor of a historic expansion of executive power, with the conservatives – including the sometimes swing vote of Justice Amy Coney Barrett – seeming to side with the administration.</p>

      <p>
      <p>House speaker worked behind the scenes to strip provision after it was added as an amendment earlier this year</p>
<p>A huge defense policy bill, revealed by US lawmakers on Sunday, does not include a provision that would have provided broad healthcare coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) for active-duty members of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">military</a>, despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s pledge to strengthen access to the procedure.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate previously approved the provision, which was added to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as an amendment earlier this year. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-johnson">Mike Johnson</a>, the speaker of the House and a diehard anti-abortion Republican, worked behind the scenes to strip the provision from the new version of the NDAA, <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/mike-johnson-works-in-secret-to-strip-ivf-health-coverage-from-defense-bill">MS NOW reported last week</a>.</p>

      <p>Defense secretary’s comments recirculating amid dispute over US strikes on alleged drug boats in Caribbean</p>
<p>The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, stated repeatedly in 2016 on Fox News that US service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump – exactly the position he called “ <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5621756-pete-hegseth-democratic-lawmakers-influence-video/">despicable</a>” when Democratic lawmakers said it last month.</p>
<p>The debate about whether US soldiers should refuse illegal orders is now at the center of a fiery political dispute over the US killings of alleged drug traffickers in boats off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Siembra in North Carolina gives owners fourth amendment rights trainings should federal agents show up at their door</p>
<p>When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection agents descended on North Carolina last month, many local businesses were ready to push back. Posted on store- and restaurant-front windows across the state were signs reading: “private area”, “fourth amendment workplace” and “There’s always room at our table, but to enter past this point, we’ll need to see a warrant signed by a judge.”</p>
<p>The signs are part of a new fourth amendment strategy launched by the North Carolina immigrant rights group Siembra, to teach business owners their rights if federal agents show up at their door. While most Americans can name the rights protected by the first and second amendments, far fewer are familiar with the fourth, which prohibits unreasonable government searches and seizures. Siembra is working to change that, seeing the fourth amendment as a vital tool in fighting against the Trump administration’s brutal immigration crackdowns.</p>

      <p>Escalation follows killing of Thai soldier and four Cambodian civilians weeks after Trump-brokered ceasefire</p>
<p>Thailand has launched airstrikes along its disputed border with Cambodia after both countries accused each other of breaching a ceasefire deal brokered by Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Four Cambodian civilians and at least one Thai soldier have been killed in the renewed clashes, which have forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet the leaders of the UK, France and Germany in London today to discuss the latest US-authored peace proposal aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>What has Trump said about the peace proposal?</strong> Last night, Donald Trump said Zelenskyy “hasn’t yet read the proposal” and claimed without evidence that “his people love it”.</p>
<p><strong>What has the US military said?</strong> The US military declined to comment when asked about Israeli surveillance activities. The Israeli military declined to comment on Frank’s demand to halt recording and noted that conversations inside the CMCC are unclassified.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments this morning in Trump v. Slaughter, a case that has broad implications for consumers and workers. The justices are considering whether the president has the power to fire the leaders of independent federal agencies — in this case, the Federal Trade Commission. Plus, we hear about data on consumers' AI use during holiday shopping and visit a Michigan wood factory that hires and houses employees in addiction recovery.</p>

<p>State and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism and protests against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/new-orleans-ice-immigration-raid">Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New Orleans</a>, monitoring message boards around the clock for threats to agents while compiling regular updates on public “sentiment” surrounding the arrests, according to law enforcement records reviewed by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.</p>

The data reveals what economists and Chinese officials have said for a while now: Chinese manufacturers can find other buyers.

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Patrick Mahomes has led his team to seven straight AFC Championship Games, winning three Super Bowls on the way. That run appears to be over</p>
<p>This is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.</p>
<p>For much of this season, there had been a gnawing sense of inevitability about the Chiefs. Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has been <em>slightly</em> better than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs. And in a one-off game, with everything on the line, it would still be hard to look past the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes axis.</p>

      <h1>Using AI chatbots for mental health support poses serious risks for teens, report finds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>A new report from Stanford and Common Sense Media finds that more than half of U.S. teens use AI chatbots for companionship. But, according to Dr. Darja Djordjevic, an adolescent and adult psychiatrist who co-authored the research, the bots aren't equipped to provide the kind of emotional support young people need when dealing with a mental health issue.</p>
<p>Dr. Djordjevic and her team simulated conversations involving various mental health concerns with four of the most popular consumer chatbots and identified several risks; chiefly, their tendency to be sycophantic. A note, this conversation mentions suicide and self-harm.</p>

      <h1>Donald Trump claims Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not read latest Ukraine war peace proposal – video</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Speaking at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night, Donald Trump said the Ukrainian president 'hasn’t yet read' the latest US-authored peace proposal for the war in Ukraine. Trump added: 'Russia is, I believe, fine with [the deal], but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it. His people love it but he hasn't read it.' The US president's comments come after days of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials ended on Saturday without an apparent breakthrough. Zelenskyy will be received in London by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, along with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the negotiations</p>

<p>The Buffalo Bills (9-4) rallied from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Cincinnati Bengals (4-9). Josh Allen threw for three touchdowns and ran for one, and Christian Benford scored the go-ahead TD on a 63-yard interception return. Allen’s 40-yard TD rush broke his record for the longest by a Bills quarterback. Buffalo flipped the game with big plays on defense on a snowy afternoon. Benford and defensive end AJ Epenesa intercepted Joe Burrow on consecutive plays from scrimmage, leading to the Bills scoring three touchdowns in a span of 4:20 in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.</p>
<p>“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”</p>

      <p>For young Americans, not being able to buy a house is more than a sob story. It’s the symbol of a broken social contract and a generational betrayal</p>
<p>Almost every couple that I know in their 20s, 30s or even 40s has had the same argument with their parents before getting married.</p>
<p>The parents say to open a wedding registry. The couple responds that they do not want one. They don’t expect gifts from wedding guests (their “presence is enough”), and they have been <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/FP/lamidi-cohab-prev-and-never-married-fp-15-21.pdf">cohabiting</a> for years and already have plates, bedsheets and a blender. In fact, since they live in a small rented apartment, they barely have room for the plates that they do have – let alone a set of china.</p>

      <p>Conservatives warned of a mass exodus if the democratic socialist won, but experts, and property data, paint a very different picture</p>

      <p>National guard shooting prompts extraordinary outburst and targeting of people from startling range of countries</p>
<p>When the history of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s second presidency is written, 26 November 2025 may well go down as a particular landmark.</p>
<p>On the eve of Thanksgiving, a lone gunman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">shot</a> two West Virginia national guards, Sarah Beckstrom, and Andrew Wolfe, as they were on patrol outside Washington DC’s Farragut West metro station, a short walk from the White House – and thereby opened the floodgates to a wave of racist and anti-immigrant invective that seemed extreme even for Trump.</p>

      <h1>Alabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>Heather Jones, now 33, went public with allegations after Robert Sullivan continued to work with children</p>
<p>The woman who publicly alleged that she was 17 when a longtime Roman Catholic priest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama">Alabama</a> successfully offered her financial support in exchange for sex and other forms of private companionship – recently prompting him to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/robert-sullivan-alabama-catholic-priest">resign</a> from the clergy – says “there is no real winner in this situation”.</p>
<p>In her first remarks since Robert “Bob” Sullivan’s self-imposed removal from the priesthood was announced by his church superiors, Heather Jones wrote in a statement that the only thing she gained was “truth finally coming to light after years of gaslighting myself into thinking it wasn’t a big deal”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A soaring stock market rewards the already well-off but Trump’s handling of the economy has caused his approval ratings to plunge</p>
<p>Entering Printemps in downtown New York City feels like an escape. A slight smell of musk hangs in the air as shoppers weave carefully around racks of coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.</p>
<p>The French luxury retail emporium opened its first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> outlet earlier this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and reds, is reminiscent of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a> movie set.</p>

      <h1>Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup final</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>Inter Miami survived a remarkable double-post escape before Messi and friends sealed the club’s first MLS Cup, giving Busquets and Alba a storybook farewell</p>
<p>The ball was going over the line. Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge. And perhaps most distressingly to Inter Miami, two retiring legends, Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba, would be closing in on ignominious ends. They would have come to MLS to accompany Messi, their friend, but would end their time on the field as losers of a final, the type of game they so often won at club and international level.</p>
<p>All that ball had to do was cross the line. The Vancouver Whitecaps’ Emmanuel Sabbi had imbued it with a seeming destiny after a virtuoso run into the heart of the Inter Miami defense. His left-footed effort wrapped around the outstretched hand of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo. It smacked the inside of the far post. It bounced on the line.</p>

<p>As the confetti flew, the Philip F Anschutz trophy was lifted into the air, and a player commonly thought to be the greatest ever to kick a ball celebrated the 48th title of his professional career, it was nearly impossible to believe that at several points, there were doubts. Serious doubts. Questions, large and small, about this Inter Miami squad, their manager, and nearly every player on the roster other than Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>Consider them answered. The Herons are MLS Cup champions after a 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps in the last game at their temporary home, Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Next year, they will open their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, as champions, and will face a high bar to clear to top a turbulent 2025 that saw them play 58 games – an all-time MLS record for games played by a team in a calendar year – for five separate trophies.</p>

<p>Former US senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bob-menendez">Bob Menendez</a> has been permanently disqualified from seeking or holding public office in his home state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> after being convicted of federal corruption charges, according to officials.</p>
<p>An order on Friday from New Jersey superior court judge Robert Lougy banned Menendez from “any position of honor, trust, or profit in state or local government”, the state’s attorney general, Matt Platkin, said in <a href="https://www.njoag.gov/ag-platkin-former-u-s-sen-bob-menendez-permanently-disqualified-from-seeking-or-holding-public-office-in-new-jersey/">a statement</a>. Menendez would face a fourth-degree charge of contempt of court if he “applies for public office or employment or takes any steps to campaign, run for or be appointed” to such a post, Platkin’s statement also said.</p>

<p>Being a member of the Pentagon press corps was once one of the more prestigious assignments in US journalism, a position reserved for heavy hitters from venerable newspapers and news channels, reporters at the peak of their powers.</p>
<p>Not any more. A press conference last week – held at a crucial time for a Pentagon embroiled in scandal – was instead attended by more than a dozen rightwing activists, with the government being held to account by a close ally of Donald Trump, an employee at Turning Point USA and someone from a pillow salesman’s nascent media company.</p>

      <p>Astrid Tuminez, Utah Valley University’s first female leader, had to pivot from personal tragedy to address ‘a wounding that happened to all of us’</p>
<p>Astrid Tuminez was on her way to Rome, the trip a kind of pilgrimage after months of grief. Her husband, Jeffrey Tolk, had died suddenly earlier in the year, and the loss had left her carrying a weight she couldn’t set down. “I felt darkness and a rage I’d never known before. It was like a tectonic shift in my reality,” she said.</p>
<p>Tuminez imagined quiet days walking through old churches, sitting in dim chapels in Rome. As part of her spiritual healing, she hoped her schedule held a meeting with Pope Leo. But as her flight landed in Atlanta for a short connection, her phone lit up. One sentence, again and again: “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie has been shot.</a>”</p>

      <p>Defense secretary defiant but allegations of war crimes and blistering watchdog report increase calls for him to go</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> is facing the most serious crisis of his tenure as defense secretary, engulfed by allegations of war crimes in the Caribbean and a blistering <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ba8ad2c-5e41-4c54-ba1d-78e5feb66a2e.pdf">inspector general report</a> accusing him of mishandling classified military intelligence. Yet despite the long list of trouble and as lawmakers from both parties call for his resignation, Hegseth shows no signs of stepping down and still holds Donald Trump’s support.</p>
<p>The twin crises have engulfed the former Fox News personality in separate but overlapping allegations that lawmakers, policy experts and former officials say reveal a pattern of dangerous recklessness at the helm of the Pentagon. Democratic legislators have reignited calls for his ouster after revelations that survivors clinging to wreckage from a September boat strike were deliberately killed in a “double-tap” attack, while a defense department investigation released on Thursday concluded he violated Pentagon policies by sharing sensitive details via the Signal messaging app hours before airstrikes in Yemen.</p>

<p>Several of the vaccine advisers are longtime anti-vaccine activists, and they were all chosen by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he fired the previous advisers in an unprecedented move to enact dramatic changes to US vaccination policy. Kennedy has been a frequent critic of vaccines.</p>

      <p>England will face a rematch of their 2018 semi-final in the opening fixture of their World Cup campaign next summer, after they were drawn alongside Croatia in Group L. England will also play Panama, another side they faced at the Russia World Cup, and Ghana.</p>
<p>At the draw in Washington DC, which lasted more than two hours after 90 minutes of preamble, there were a number of strong groups selected. Scotland will also face a partial repeat of their last World Cup campaign in 1998 after they were drawn alongside Brazil and Morocco, as well as Haiti, in Group C.</p>
<p>The most prominent candidate for the title of 'Group of Death' is Group I, where the seeds France are joined by Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway alongside the winner of an international playoff. USA face Australia, Paraguay and a European playoff winner.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Each nation’s World Cup is defined, for good or bad, by huge, indelible moments. With a favorable draw, the onus is now on the US to create them</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic vividly remembers watching it with his family. So does Tyler Adams, who saw it with his friends from soccer camp. Memories of Tim Howard catching an Algerian header in Pretoria, and hurling it upfield to ignite the counterattack that would lead to Landon Donovan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbn3rOPmR9w&amp;t=56s">instantly iconic</a> goal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm7ievQ2bHo">The goal</a> that spared the United States men’s national team’s blushes at the 2010 World Cup, sneaking them out of the group stage at Algeria’s expense. One of the most iconic moments in US socer history.</p>

<p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan, as he cordially introduced himself to the federal courtroom in Charlotte on Friday, admitted it was his competitive side and novelty within the sport that emboldened a push for 23XI Racing to “challenge” Nascar over what he perceived were violations of antitrust rules.</p>
<p>Jordan shared financial and corporate details of his 23XI team and said he invested $40m of his own funds in the success of the Nascar Cup series team launched along with business partner Curtis Polk and longtime driver Denny Hamlin.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Judge seems skeptical of administration’s case and whether any crisis justifying deployment still exists in Los Angeles</p>
<p>The judge presiding over California’s lawsuit against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> challenged the federal government’s authority and rationale for continuing to maintain command over the national guard troops it deployed to Los Angeles earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Trump administration federalized the state’s national guard in June, dispatching about 4,000 troops in response to protests in the city over immigration raids, despite opposition from the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. The state quickly filed a lawsuit, with Newsom calling the move unprecedented and illegal, and the case has been unfolding in the courts for months.</p>

Cole was accused of placing pipe bombs outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican parties not far from the US Capitol and the White House on the evening of 5 January 2021.

<p>The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://prismreports.org/2025/12/04/prison-rape-elimination-act-trans-intersex-trump-doj/">justice department memo</a> issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.</p>

      <p>Reform UK leader’s legal threats, denials and attacks on the media are tactics often deployed by US president</p>
<p>When Nigel Farage angrily denounced the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/farage-turns-on-broadcasters-racism-allegations-bbc">insulted one of its presenters</a> for raising questions about his alleged schoolboy racism, those who have been studying the tactics of the right noted that his behaviour felt familiar.</p>
<p>“Is it out of the Trump playbook? I think that’s exactly what’s going on,” said Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster. “This is becoming his new modus operandi, turning defence into attack. It’s exactly the tactics White House press secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/karoline-leavitt-white-house-press-conference">Karoline Leavitt</a>, uses. There are a lot of journalists in this country who just aren’t used to it.”</p>

      <h1>Science journal retracts study on safety of Monsanto’s Roundup: ‘serious ethical concerns’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence</p>
<p>The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">has formally retracted</a> a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.</p>
<p>Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">note</a> accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.</p>
<p>The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.</p>

      <p>How wired into your brain are tech companies? Spotify offers us a clue. The streaming company runs its Spotify Wrapped marketing campaign every December, taking user data and AI to create a personalized year-in-review for every listener — and it's an incredibly effective marketing move that consumers want to be a part of. Also: a preview of the last Fed meeting of the year and a manufacturing CEO's thoughts on tariffs and factory activity.</p>

      <h1>Pam Bondi tells law enforcement agencies to investigate antifa groups for ‘tax crimes’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Move is part of Trump’s broader crackdown on leftwing groups, including designation of antifa as ‘domestic terrorism’ group</p>

<p>The US attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, instructed law enforcement officials on Thursday to investigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list">antifa</a> and other supposeddomestic terror groups, and specifically directed them to search for “tax crimes” the groups may have committed, according to a memo obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The document signals how the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and Bondi are ramping up efforts to crack down on leftwing groups. Antifa, short for antifascist, is not a clearly defined organization, but rather a loose network of activists. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-executive-order-antifa-terrorist-organization">signed an executive order</a> in September declaring it a domestic terrorism organization – something legal experts say he does not have the authority to do.</p>

      <p>Defenders rally to Olivia Nuzzi amid book mockery, while rakish David Dimbleby channels his inner Dickens</p>
<p>It’s publication week for American Canto, the hastily turned around memoir by the former New York magazine journalist Olivia Nuzzi, who took on the challenge of explaining what it was about Robert F Kennedy Jr she found so alluring, a task for which no upper word limit is adequate. Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.</p>

      <p>Following a fierce bidding war, Netflix announced this morning that it’s buying Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth more than $82 billion. The deal still has to be approved by regulators, and some lawmakers are already raising antitrust concerns. We learn more. Then, as part of our lunar economy mini-series, we hear what a lack of private interest oversight could mean for an economy beyond the clouds.</p>

<p>Two men who survived a US airstrike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean clung to the wreckage for an hour before they were killed in a second attack, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/video-second-boat-strike-military-caribbean">a video of the episode shown to senators</a> in Washington.</p>
<p>The men were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible radio or other communications equipment. They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that the US military was weighing whether to finish them off, two sources familiar with the recording told Reuters.</p>

      <h1>India's biggest airline faces another day of delays and cancellations</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Major airports in India have descended into chaos after the airline IndiGo either canceled or delayed hundreds of flights for the fourth consecutive day. IndiGo says there have been technical issues with aircraft or winter schedules that have delayed some flights, but the biggest reason is a pilot shortage. Also, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal, and some countries are boycotting Eurovision over Israel's involvement.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration has been trying for months to ban AI regulations at the state level. And its latest gambit to roll such a measure into the congressional National Defense Authorization Act appears to have failed.

<p>Plus, New York recently became the first state to enforce an AI law designed to protect consumers from &quot;algorithmic pricing.&quot; And Amazon pulled back on AI dubbing for some international content after anime fans complained.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami’s journey to MLS Cup has been methodical, and Messi-centered</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Ever since the club’s very beginning, David Beckham and Jorge Mas have had moments like this Saturday in mind</p>
<p>Back on 27 February 2020, days before Inter Miami’s first-ever fixture in MLS, I stood next to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas, and co-owner David Beckham as part of an MLS press junket in New York City. I was there for Sports Illustrated and my show Planet Fútbol TV, which I co-hosted with my friend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/grant-wahl-death-world-cup-qatar-2022-tribute-soccer">the late, great Grant Wahl</a>. We were adamant that the Inter Miami story was riveting, not just because of Beckham’s influence in MLS, but also because his new club was about to introduce the unique culture of Miami and south Florida – the Latin American capital of the world – to the league.</p>
<p>The conversation in 2020 was my second meeting with Mas and my first with Beckham. I remember the sense of excitement from both men, knowing that this Inter Miami project – seven years in the making before their debut in the league – was about to come to fruition after a long, arduous journey. From legal battles with Internazionale over the trademark of the word “Inter” to political and structural problems as they tried to make a stadium, Miami Freedom Park, a reality. Now, the club was finally starting life in MLS.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Daughter of James Comey was dismissed by Trump justice department from job as prosecutor in New York</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/who-is-maurene-comey-fired-federal-prosector">Maurene Comey</a>, the federal prosecutor who helmed criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, appeared at Manhattan federal court on Thursday, in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/epstein-prosecutor-maurene-comey-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> claiming she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/maurene-comey-fired-sources">fired</a> as political retaliation against her father, James Comey.</p>
<p>Comey was terminated in July, shortly after the federal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, whose prosecution she led; he was found guilty of prostitution-related crimes. Comey’s lawsuit contends that Donald Trump’s justice department axed her without explanation or cause, and instead simply cited “article 2 of the United States constitution and the laws of the United States” in an email.</p>

      <p>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered</p>
<p>Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The supreme court’s decision came after a 2-1 ruling from a three-judge panel striking down Texas’s new map in November. The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.</p>

<p>Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.</p>

      <h1>US student who took four chickens after breaking into a farm sentenced to 90 days in jail</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Zoe Rosenberg, 23, studying at UC Berkeley, had said it was a ‘rescue’ and ‘will not apologize’ for her actions</p>
<p>A California student has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after breaking into a Petaluma poultry and taking four chickens in an effort she called a “rescue”.</p>
<p>Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, was convicted of felony conspiracy and three misdemeanor counts in October. On Wednesday, a jury sentenced her to 90 days – 60 of which may involve jail alternates, such as house arrest – far less than the four and a half year maximum sentence she could have faced. The jury also ordered Rosenberg to pay more than $100,000 to Petaluma Poultry, the Perdue Farms facility from which she took four chickens in 2023. Rosenberg has been ordered to report to the Sonoma county jail on 10 December.</p>

</ul>
<p>Top Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress on Thursday said that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had not ordered the military to kill surviving members of a deadly attack on a boat alleged to be carrying drugs in the Caribbean, but differed over whether the double strike was appropriate.</p>
<p>The allegation that Hegseth ordered the killing of survivors sparked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/venezuela-boat-strikes-legality-hegseth">bipartisan concern</a> in Washington that he or others involved may have committed a war crime. On Thursday, US navy admiral Frank Bradley, who commanded the attack, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Dan Caine, appeared before the House and Senate’s armed services and intelligence committees for a closed briefing in which they showed video and discussed the attack with lawmakers.</p>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>An investigation found defense secretary put US forces at risk, triggering fresh demands for his resignation</p>
<p>The Department of Defense’s inspector general released the much-anticipated unclassified <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/04/2003834916/-1/-1/1/DODIG_2026_021.PDF">report</a> on Thursday about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>’s disclosure of plans for military airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal group chat earlier this year.</p>
<p>It found that Hegseth violated departmental policies when he shared information in the chat, and that if a foreign enemy force intercepted that information it could have endangered the lives of US troops, as the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/hegseth-yemen-signal-group-chat">reported on Wednesday</a>. “Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,” the report said.</p>

      <p>From 1990 to 2019, reported cases of acute hepatitis B among kids declined by 99% due to infant immunization</p>
<p>After a contentious meeting, vaccine advisers for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted on Thursday to delay a vote on restricting hepatitis B vaccination for infants.</p>
<p>The meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) turned confrontational at times before one member introduced a motion to delay the vote, which passed by six to three, to give advisers time to examine the wording before taking a vote.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump went on another extended racist tirade against Somalis on Wednesday, Minneapolis activists prepared for more targeting of the community by conducting trainings on their rights and planning how they would protect their neighbors.</p>
<p>In the White House on Wednesday, a reporter asked the president about Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, who has defended the Somali community. Trump responded: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian – look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. Billions and billions.”</p>

      <p>These days, Americans are drinking less alcohol. While that may be a positive from a health perspective, it’s not great news for California grape growers. Industry groups predict that 2025 will be the smallest harvest since the mid-’90s. These changing consumption habits are changing the landscape of California vineyards. Also, the Trump administration is reducing fuel efficiency standards, and layoffs are running high ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting.</p>

As a result, many leading outlets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/defense-department-media-news-rules">turned in their credentials in protest</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas was an exuberant child with a button nose and pinchable cheeks – a little kid who loved running fast, playing Minecraft and watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family.

<p>Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.</p>
<p>USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?</strong> A federal judge in August <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling">ordered it to close</a> after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck">has close ties</a> to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?</strong> The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.</p>
<p><strong>Why have they released these photos now?</strong> It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, signed 19 November.</p>

      <h1>Meta faces an investigation over AI in WhatsApp</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European antitrust regulators have just launched an investigation into Meta over its rollout of artificial intelligence features on WhatsApp for European users. This move marks the latest action by European regulators against large technology firms, as the trade bloc seeks to balance support for the sector with efforts to curb its expanding influence. Then, air travelers in India face continued disruptions, and Japan tries to regain a stronghold in semiconductor chip manufacturing.</p>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Pentagon’s Law of War manual clearly prohibits attack, but justification for whole campaign also faces tough questions</p>
<p>Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.</p>
<p>A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.</p>

      <p>Experts say any change to the hepatitis B schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences</p>
<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr’s vaccine advisory committee convenes on Thursday to consider a reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to delay hepatitis B shots for newborn babies.</p>
<p>For decades, federal health recommendations have suggested that all newborns be vaccinated against the virus that can lead to serious liver disease. Kennedy, the US health secretary and a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot.</p>

      <h1>Have we given up on data privacy?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Every day, consumers are confronted with the fragility of our personal data privacy — another data breach, another government agency accessing databases they didn't previously have access to, another consent form popping up to get permission to gather more data.</p>
<p>It's almost too much for any one person to keep a handle on, according to Rohan Grover, professor of artificial intelligence and media at American University. He recently co-authored a piece for The Conversation about why data privacy seems to have largely fallen out of the public discourse, even though he says the topic is more urgent than ever.</p>

      <h1>Wilfried Nancy’s move to Celtic means as much for MLS as it does for him</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>New Celtic manager may not be a big name but he won over the US league with leadership style and attractive football</p>
<p>Other managers won more in Major League Soccer than Wilfried Nancy. Bruce Arena, say, certainly has a fuller trophy cabinet. Nancy, however, lifted more than just trophies. He lifted standards. At Columbus Crew, he set a benchmark for the rest, showing what was possible even with limited resources. Columbus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/29/mls-cup-inter-miami-vancouver-whitecaps-san-diego-nycfc">didn’t have Lionel Messi</a> or Son Heung-min, but they had Nancy as head coach, and that was often enough.</p>
<p>For the past three seasons, the Crew have been the most dynamic, boundary-pushing team in MLS. Nancy’s CF Montreal team weren’t bad either, establishing the style of play that would come to be known as Nancyball. He changed MLS’s managerial landscape for ever. It was only a matter of time until a call came from Europe.</p>

      <h1>Jaxson Dart says the NFL ‘isn’t soccer’. The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The rookie plays like a linebacker at quarterback. His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himself</p>
<p>Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: <em>this is real football</em>. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">taking the latest</a> in a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.”</p>
<p>Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Dart <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">took another heavy hit</a> near the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots. Dart scrambled out of the pocket on second-and-13 and ran for a first down. As he approached the sideline, Dart could have stepped out and gained fewer yards while still moving the chains. Instead, he braced, lowered his shoulder and <a href="https://x.com/OmahaProd/status/1995670356674412922">was sent soaring through the air</a> by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss.</p>

Critics are speaking out about the use of stock footage in the ads, saying it doesn’t actually show the Ring of Fire. Here's what we found out.</p>

<p>From hit dramas like Stranger Things and The Summer I Turned Pretty, to attention grabbing reality shows, many shows on streaming platforms that made their name on binge watching are now releasing episodes weekly or in bite-sized chunks. Experts say the format and social factors are driving some fans to catch episodes when they air, though with more flexibility than broadcast TV allows.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon watchdog finds Hegseth’s use of Signal posed risk to US personnel, AP sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The Pentagon’s watchdog has found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen. That's according to two people familiar with the findings on Wednesday. One of the people says Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly. Hegseth denied posting classified information regarding plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen in March. The review by the Pentagon inspector general’s office was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Small business owners’ economic moods remain mixed. But, as is so often the case, how folks feel is different from how they act. And hard data tells us small business owners are pulling back on hiring — one ADP report shows businesses with fewer than 50 employees cut a net 120,000 jobs in November. Should we be worried? Plus: Retailers benefit from buy now, pay later offerings, import prices sans fuel rose in September, and cap-and-trade carbon emissions programs have changed since their inception.</p>

      <h1>The Clippers’ chaotic unravelling leaves Chris Paul as its most painful casualty</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Los Angeles have turned a feelgood reunion into a late-career humiliation for one of their greatest players – and exposed a franchise stumbling into a darker new era</p>
<p>Pull out your Los Angeles Clippers bingo cards. Anyone have the square marked “owner and star player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/clippers-deny-claims-star-forward-kawhi-leonard-was-paid-28m-for-job-that-didnt-exist">accused of skirting the salary cap</a> through improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/clippers-chris-paul-sent-home-stunning-late-night-move">wee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning</a>, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”.</p>
<p>The Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister.</p>

<p>The new images and videos show Epstein’s home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appears to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which the words “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/business/jeffrey-epstein-island.html">reported</a> that Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies.

      <h1>A fuel efficiency rollback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce weaker fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks at a White House event today. The move will likely reverse a Biden-era rule requiring automakers to reach an average of 50 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2031. Plus, as part of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/lunar-economy">our lunar economy series</a>, we hear how one company is recycling space debris into more useful products for the space industry.</p>

      <h1>Family of victim of Trump boat airstrikes files complaint against ‘extrajudicial killing’ | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Alejandro Carranza Medina’s relatives say he was a fisher, not a drug trafficker. Plus, Putin says Russia ‘ready’ for war with Europe as Ukraine talks stall</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A family in Colombia has filed a petition with the Washington DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), alleging that the Colombian citizen Alejandro Carranza Medina was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/trump-caribbean-drug-boat-attack-complaint">subject to an “extrajudicial killing”</a> in a US airstrike.</p>
<p><strong>What is the IACHR?</strong> A monitoring body designed to “promote and protect human rights in the western hemisphere”. The US is a member, and the state department said in March it was a “strong supporter of the IACHR”.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> <strong>ow has the Trump administration responded?</strong> A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, did not respond directly to questions about the complaint or about Carranza’s death, but wrote in an email that the media were “now running cover for foreign terrorists smuggling deadly narcotics intended to murder Americans”.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the front</strong> <strong>lines?</strong> Buoyed up by recent gains, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European politicians have reached a provisional agreement to phase out imports of Russian gas by 2027. Exports of oil and gas have been crucial for Russia to fund its military campaign in Ukraine. Russia says Europe will be less competitive and that consumers will have to pay higher prices. Then, we'll check in on Japan's work-life balance and hear about a diamond-studded Faberge egg, which just sold at auction for $30 million.</p>

<p>During a federal trial in North Carolina over whether a new voter registration law discriminates against college students, a prominent rightwing election integrity activist previewed Republicans’ long-range plans to end same-day registration.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Schroeder is deliberating over the future of provisions in Senate bill 747, which increased registration requirements for voters who cast ballots on the same day they register to vote during North Carolina’s early voting period. Schroeder called for briefs at the end of November after a week-long trial in Winston-Salem.</p>

<p>On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.</p>
<p>Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.</p>

<p>Trump administration officials have defended carrying out a follow-up strike on a drug boat that killed survivors on 2 September by arguing that its objective was to ensure the complete destruction of the boat, an action the Pentagon had internal legal approval to conduct.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Monday that Adm Frank Bradley, who oversaw the operation and gave the order for the second strike, directed it to sink the boat.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve’s quantitative approach to monetary policy decisions means its governors tend to reach consensus.

In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and former FOMC member Daniel Tarullo discuss why the Fed is divided right now. Plus: Dollar stores weather an uncertain economy, companies use return-to-office policies as a workforce reduction mechanism, and electricity demand grows as data centers pop up nationwide.</p>

<p>Just over two months after it was announced Algoma Steel would receive $500 million in government loan guarantees, the steel producer said it was issuing 1,000 layoff notices to workers at its plant in Sault Ste.

      <p>Donation of $6.25bn for children’s investment accounts prompts wave of questions – but details remain scarce</p>
<p>A tech billionaire and his wife said on Tuesday they would pour $6.25bn into individual investment accounts for 25 million children under 10, prompting a wave of new questions about how these so-called “Trump accounts” will work.</p>
<p>The creation of these accounts was included as part of Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and spending bill, which he signed into law in July. Every child born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, can receive a Trump account that includes a $1,000 initial deposit from the administration. The money will then be invested.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary said that the decision to re-strike the “narco terrorist vessel” was made by Adm Frank M Bradley, “operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”. Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.</p>

      <p>American Bitcoin Corp’s shares fell from <span class="math inline">\(2.39 to \)</span>1.90 after closing in what some are calling ‘crypto winter’</p>
<p>Shares in Eric Trump’s crypto mining business lost more than half their value in less than 30 minutes on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The nosedive of American Bitcoin Corp, which triggered repeated trading halts, followed the steep decline of many cryptocurrencies and crypto-linked companies into what <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/bitcoin-rebounds-after-drawdown-hits-20percent-is-the-crypto-winter-over-or-just-starting-.html">some observers</a> are calling the onset of a “crypto winter”.

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has said he didn’t know anything about a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat on 2 September. He also stood by his defence secretary, saying Pete Hegseth didn’t know a US navy admiral had ordered a second strike. Hegseth also denied knowledge of it, but stated the admiral ‘had the complete authority’ to launch it</p>

<p>Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.</p>
<p>Williams, 44, has not played an official match since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement">her run to the third round of the US Open</a> more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.</p>

<p>A post on social media by US defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, depicting a beloved children’s character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book’s Canadian publisher.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.</p>

      <h1>What Trump’s asylum ‘pause’ means – and what it doesn’t</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>The US president has halted decisions on many asylum claims, but the scope, legality and real-world effects of the pause remain unclear</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/trump-asylum-pause-afghanistan">Asylum seekers across US in limbo over Trump’s policy reversals: ‘devastating’</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghani national who assisted US forces during the two-decade war there and was paroled into the United States in 2021. US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the president’s asylum pause will last. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/30/donald-trump-pause-asylum-applications/87544306007/">Trump told reporters Sunday</a> that the directive “has no time limit, but it could be a long time”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Corporate bond spreads, extra compensation that corporate bonds pay out compared to government bonds, have been narrowing this year, which means investors aren’t demanding much additional money to account for additional credit risk. That could indicate that investors think economic growth could pick up in the near term. Also on the program: a trade deal regarding U.K. pharmaceuticals and OPEC's plans to keep oil production flat to start the new year.</p>

<p>The revelation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/trinidad-and-tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> has approved the installation of a US military radar facility has stoked fears that the Caribbean could be drawn into the escalating crisis between the US and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had attempted to allay concerns about a US C-17 aircraft that had landed in the country, claiming it was carrying marines to assist with a road construction project. She also claimed she was told that no marines remained in the country.</p>

      <p>Your essential guide to Friday’s draw in Washington DC, including where to watch it, who to watch out for and a look at Fifa’s peace prize</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a> draw will start at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center at 12pm local time on Friday 5 December (5pm GMT/4am Saturday AEST). Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.</p>
