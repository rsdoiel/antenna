      <h1>How the government shutdown will affect federal workers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The slow-moving train wreck we've been watching unfold for a week, has indeed wrecked: the government officially shutdown at midnight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed, and the Trump administration is threatening to fire others. Later in the show, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour sits down with Susan M. Collins, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. They'll discuss tariffs, a cooling labor market and how the central bank is affected by a government shutdown.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown, which began overnight, will delay key reports on the U.S. economy, including a monthly snapshot of the job market, which was scheduled for release on Friday.</p>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The role of artificial intelligence in mental health care is an unsettled issue. States including Illinois, Utah, and Nevada limit or ban the use of AI for therapy. And researchers say such conversations can sometimes veer off course and even be dangerous.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Jenna Glover, chief clinical officer at the mental health care platform Headspace, which launched an AI assistant, Ebb, last year.</p>

      <h1>The "stuck economy," tariffs and Wall Street</h1>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>While the stock market appears unconcerned about potential red flags in this economy, the bond market's a bit more cautious. As Washington nears a shutdown and the labor market flags, Treasury yields are ticking down. But demand for those safer, long-term bonds hasn’t been uniform. Plus: Trump adds to existing tariffs on Canadian lumber, OpenAI wades into e-commerce waters, and Abha Bhattarai at the Washington Post talks about the “stuck economy.”</p>

      <p>Las Vegas is facing a months long decline in tourism, partly due <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-travel-us-decline-trump-canada-fd1b3fc3225703ee3e521754a171ecfb">fewer international visitors</a> to the United States overall.

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry. Higher education also uses the H-1B visa, and that fee could be a big problem there. Brendan Cantwell, a professor at Michigan State University, unpacks what these changes mean for universities. But first, Dr. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds joins us to discuss President Trump's latest tariffs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Colleges and universities are dealing with a growing problem of college admission essays being written by artificial intelligence. Rather than try to figure out which essays are AI-generated, some schools are turning to an alternative approach: Have students submit a video instead.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Anne Kim, senior editor at Washington Monthly magazine who recently wrote about this new strategy that's gaining steam in higher education.</p>

      <p>Pending home sales rose in August, boosted by a slight drop in mortgage rates. Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool. Also in this episode: Banks respond to the Fed rate cut, retailers prepare for holiday hiring, and tech companies hope nuclear is the answer to data center energy demand.</p>

      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing a special bonus episode from “How We Survive.” It’s a conversation between host Amy Scott, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Elizabeth Kolbert. Together, they dig into how the climate crisis is triggering economic disruption. Plus, some solutions to be hopeful about.</p>
<p>And, we get a peek into Kolbert’s forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/781145/life-on-a-little-known-planet-by-elizabeth-kolbert/">”Life on a Little-Known Planet: Dispatches from a Changing World.”</a> In this collection of her most influential essays, Kolbert takes readers around the globe, telling stories about caterpillars, whale conversations and the people trying to preserve our planet.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded live, over Zoom, in front of an audience. You can watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5QiojlV640">here</a>. The event is presented by Odoo with additional underwriting support from The Economist.</p>

      <h1>Consumer spending outpaced income — again</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row. Thanks to tariff-induced price bumps, consumers are dipping into savings and using credit cards to keep up with their typical spending. In this episode, how long can consumers stay resilient? Plus: LA businesses prepare for ongoing ICE raids, a ski group vies to manage U.S. surfing at the 2028 Olympics, and an artist’s work changes in the age of e-commerce.</p>

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more.

      <p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a company called Tricolor abruptly filed for bankruptcy. The Texas-based firm offered auto loans to buyers with poor (or no) credit ratings. That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more.

Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners.

Plus, India has reduced taxes on everyday items to counteract the effects of U.S. tariffs, and the UK government says it saved around $600 million last year using artificial intelligence to combat fraud.</p>

      <h1>Rate cut? So what?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>Newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran has argued the federal funds rate should be a full two percentage points lower than its current level. A major cut like that could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs, spurring spending. But longer-term, inflation would likely balloon. After that: Auto dealers face new obstacles as EV tax credits end, a traveling nurse navigates frequent moves, and U.S. economic growth is “more resilient than expected,&quot; according to an OECD report.</p>

      <p>President Trump is not a fan of the United Nations—he made that clear in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly today. Under Trump, the United States has pulled back from several efforts, including U.N. organizations, that have contributed to the country’s so-called soft power goals. On the show today, Joshua Eisenman, professor of politics in the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame, joins Kimberly to discuss the changing role of the U.S. in global politics and how China is seizing this moment to gain more influence.</p>

      <p>The newest member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors — close ally of President Donald Trump, Stephen Miran — made his case for more (and larger) interest rate cuts in a speech yesterday at the Economic Club of New York. He argued that the president's policies will push prices down, so the Fed doesn’t have to worry that lowering interest rates will spark inflation. Plus, entrepreneurship could suffer following the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There’s a race going on among tech firms — big and small — to join in the construction of what President Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome, a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Tens of billions of dollars in military contracts are at stake. In fact, the total cost might be in the trillions and the project could stretch a decade.</p>
<p>The technology and scale needed to make this all happen is, so far, largely unproven. And a whole host of tech firms are trying to show that they can help with the very complex undertaking. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sheera Frenkel, reporter at the New York Times, about some of the tech that would make this whole system work.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration is working to tamp down alarm over a new, $100,000 visa fee it announced on Friday. Technology, finance, and other major companies that depend on employees holding H-1B visas had initially thought the fee would be applied to existing visa holders, and those with H-1B workers who were temporarily abroad panicked. The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Google announced it will integrate Gemini, its AI assistant, into the Chrome web browser. That will transform Chrome — the most used search engine — into an “agentic” browser. More on what that means for your data privacy and the race to advance AI tech, in this episode. Plus: Independent craft stores aim to fill the void left by Jo-Ann Fabrics, and how feeding the 82% of Alaskan communities that don’t have road access is a feat of public infrastructure.</p>

      <p>If you have, you're not alone. American consumers lost more than $1 billion to fraud on social media in the first six months of this year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. That’s almost ten times what it was five years ago. Today, we'll hear how consumers can protect themselves. But first, we know what the Federal Reserve did with short-term interest rates this week. What's driving long-term interest rates right now?</p>

      <h1>What does ownership mean in the digital age?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      <p>There’s a new class action lawsuit against Amazon Prime Video that’s once again elevating the question of ownership in the digital age: Who actually owns a movie, a song, a video game?Buy a physical copy, like a CD or DVD, and the answer is obvious. But buy a digital copy, and the answer gets very complicated.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Aaron Perzanowski, a law professor at the University of Michigan and author of the book “The End of Ownership: Personal Property in the Digital Economy,” to learn about the current state of digital ownership.</p>

      <h1>Facing Trump's pressure, the Fed cuts rates for the first time this year</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter percentage point Wednesday in an effort to cushion the sagging job market. The move comes as policymakers face growing pressure from President Trump.

      <h1>The cost of GOP cuts to coal royalties</h1>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>Wyoming made billions from coal mining over the last 50 years, funding the government, schools, roads, parks. But President Trump’s major spending bill, passed in July, gives mining companies a break on royalty fees — leaving state budgets lean. In this episode, easing coal fees comes at a price. Plus: Non-store retail spending saw double-digit year-over-year growth, small businesses suffer as they wait for tariff clarity, and stock investors basically ignore all the bad economic headlines.</p>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>Public companies report their earnings every three months, giving investors and the public regular snapshots of how business is going. But President Trump wants to see fewer of those reports. In a social media post on Monday, he said companies should report just twice a year instead of quarterly. Susan Schmidt, a portfolio manager at Exchange Capital Resources — and one of the folks who is often looking at those reports — joins us to weigh in.</p>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>On Monday, President Trump said public companies should no longer report quarterly earnings. Instead, he suggested corporations report just twice a year. Trump isn't the first to suggest a pared-down reporting schedule, but the idea raises questions about the balance between corporate transparency and long-term growth. Also on the show, the South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human rights violations during a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where 300 South Korean workers were detained and deported. So what does this episode tell us about the U.S. immigration system? Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation of American Policy, joins us to discuss.</p>

      <p>&quot;When you face bad economic numbers, you've got two choices: fix the economy or attack the numbers,&quot; says University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration. But first, grocery prices jumped in August. Thing is, tariffs aren't to blame.</p>

      <p>The labor market has been cooling for a bit, and in some sectors is virtually frozen. That could push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. But the Fed’s other mandate, besides maximum employment, is price stability. And inflation is picking up. What to do, what to do…. Later in this episode: Why are utilities costs up? Are restaurants hiring when no one else is? And, should retirement accounts have access to private equity funds?</p>

      <p>A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction barring President Donald Trump from ousting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, which means she can stay in her job while she fights her dismissal. The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services. Why is that not the case with electricity providers?</p>
