      <h1>What happens if Trump gets the interest rate he wants?</h1>

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump has been relentlessly trying to increase control over the Federal Reserve, most recently with his attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The Fed controls the Federal Funds Rate, which is currently at around 4.5%; the president wants it down to 1%. So, what if that happened? We'll outline the ripple effects. Also: Nvidia didn't meet Wall Street’s lofty expectations, and Cracker Barrel’s logo saga shows us the power of upset consumers.</p>

      On Friday, the U.S. is ending its de minimis rule that made it easy for cheap goods to reach consumers. The change will affect roughly 4 million such packages processed each day.

"Marketplace" host Amy Scott talks with Abha Bhattarai from the Washington Post about how women are losing workforce participation gains made during the pandemic.

      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency.

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; it was once China's largest real estate firm but collapsed under a mountain of debt. Today, we'll trace its spectacular rise and fall. Rare earths have been a major sticking point in trade negotiations between China and the United States. China has dominated the rare earths market, but could Australia become a rival?</p>

      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip? Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <p>President Donald Trump recently demanded that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook resign after she was accused of mortgage fraud. In a statement, Cook said she has no intention of being "bullied to step down" and that she's "gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions." We'll hear more.

      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak tomorrow in Jackson Hole, and we'll be watching for hints about the future of interest rates. But one tricky part of the inflation equation? Rent. Higher interest rates have kept many would-be homebuyers in the rental market, which boosted overall demand and pushed rents higher.

      <h1>It's quality over low cost for U.S. clothing manufacturing</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <h1>Outsourced jobs threatened by AI</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/19/outsourced-jobs-threatened-by-ai">Marketplace Morning Report</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan’s SoftBank has invested $2 billion in U.S. chipmaker Intel, which has been losing ground lately in the booming AI market. It also comes as the U.S. government weighs whether to take a direct stake in the company. And, as historic White House talks spark hopes of a Putin–Zelensky summit, the war in Ukraine grinds on, with Russia turning to North Korea to plug major labor gaps.</p>

      <p>New context for the strong-consumer-spending-and-falling-consumer-sentiment combo: According to a Boston Fed report, the proportion of spending done by top-earning U.S. households is growing, and the share spent by lower-income Americans is shrinking. What might that widening gap tells us about the trajectory of this economy?

      <h1>Electricity prices are climbing more than twice as fast as inflation</h1>

(date: 2025-08-16, from: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5502671/electricity-bill-high-inflation-ai">NPR Economic</a>)
      <p>
      Electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation.  That's especially costly during the dog days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.  In addition to hot weather, a variety of factors are causing power bills to climb, including the high cost of natural gas used to generate electricity and soaring demand from data centers.

      For most Americans, we just lived through the highest period of inflation in our lives. And we are reminded of this every time we go grocery shopping. All over TikTok, tons of people have posted videos of how little they got for… $20. $40. $100. Most upsetting to us: an $8 box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br><br>Food prices are almost 30% higher than they were five years ago. It’s bad. And those new, higher prices aren’t going away.<br><br>At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down. And yet, our fears or feelings that things will spiral out of control again? Those have not slowed down.<br><br>This mismatch has been giving us all the... feelings. Inflation feelings. Infeelings. <br><br>On our latest show: we sort through our infeeltions. We talk to the economists who have studied us.

But it's not just about the sport; the event is also designed to attract investment. Then, as Bolivia heads to the polls this weekend, an economic crisis is front and centre in voters’ minds. And later, UN talks on a global plastics treaty have ended without a deal.<br></p>

      <p>Earlier this week, the July CPI report showed consumer prices remained steady, despite tariff noise. Today’s producer price index tells a different story: Wholesale prices grew a whopping 3.3% year-over-year. When might retailers pass those higher costs on to consumers? We break it down. Plus: Automated applications sow pessimism among job hunters, New York City marks two months of a ban on tenant-paid broker fees, and U.S. oil refineries face regionally different outlooks.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month, claiming that the monthly jobs numbers — which were revised downward — were “rigged” to make him look bad. Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare? Also: a flare of inflation at the wholesale level and a comeback for adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>

But first, New York’s attorney general is suing the company that runs Zelle, alleging its customers were left open to fraud.</p>
