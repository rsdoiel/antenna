urge US House to pass Kids Online Safety Act</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A bipartisan effort to protect children from the harms of social
media is running out of time in this session of the U.S. Congress. If
passed, the Kids Online Safety Act would institute safeguards for
minors’ personal data online. But free speech advocates and some
Republicans are concerned the bill could lead to censorship. VOA’s
Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson has more. Kim Lewis

<li>Federal land emissions are falling
</h3>
<p>
Greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. federal lands peaked in 2009 and have
been mostly falling ever since, according to a
<a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/66bf4a0cd34e033882837601?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_v2WmbZ53sx4QHJuke8gkx0xQXW5NozuSnu91toxPOVZFYIINhjofueTh15f74IZRiCmTH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
from the U.S. Geological Survey. Federal lands make up nearly 30% of all
the nation’s land. In 2009, annual emissions from fossil fuel extraction
and use on these lands reached 1,430.9 million metric tons of CO2
equivalent, but had fallen to 1,118.9 million metric tons in 2022.
Emissions saw a particularly steep drop in 2020, likely linked to the
pandemic, and have been rising, but it’s not clear if the upward trend
will continue. Wyoming is a major emitter: Its federal land CO2
emissions in 2022 made up 41% of the national total.

<p>
The same report also found that natural ecosystems (like soil,
vegetation, and deadwood) on federal lands are offsetting just 1.4% of
the annual emissions, and that “climate conditions” like drought and
wildfire have “resulted in a decline in the sink strength of ecosystems
on federal lands.” For context, total greenhouse gas emissions for the
U.S. have been

the results</a> of its analysis of the economic and environmental
implications of expanding U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-study?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_v2WmbZ53sx4QHJuke8gkx0xQXW5NozuSnu91toxPOVZFYIINhjofueTh15f74IZRiCmTH" rel="noopener" target="_self">Among
its key findings</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
LNG projects that have already been approved are likely to produce more
than enough natural gas to meet global demand. New facilities that are
under construction will nearly double exports by 2030, and exports could
double again after that if all the facilities that have been approved,
but have not yet reached a final investment decision, end up getting
built.
</li>
<li>
Demand for U.S. LNG has flattened in Europe and peaked in Japan, while
South Korea’s demand is expected to plateau by 2030. China will be the
largest LNG importer through 2050.
</li>
<li>
While new LNG terminals will create jobs and revenues, increased exports
could also raise wholesale domestic natural gas prices by more than 30%
by 2050.
</li>
<li>
In all five scenarios the DOE studied, U.S. LNG exports would increase
global net emissions.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The main takeaway, according to an accompanying letter penned by the
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, is that “a business-as-usual
approach is neither sustainable nor advisable.” In a call on Tuesday,
Granholm acknowledged that the future is in the next administration’s
hands. “We hope that they’ll take these facts into account to determine
whether additional LNG exports are truly in the best interest of the
American people and economy,” she said.

Global coal demand is set to rise to a new record this year and remain
steady through 2027, according to the International Energy Agency. While
the rapid rollout of renewables is encroaching on coal’s “century-long
supremacy in electricity generation,” soaring power demand is
counterbalancing this trend and giving coal a boost, the IEA said in its

<h3>
A Great Global Calamity
</h3>
<p class="drop-caps">
Five years ago this month, the novel coronavirus that would eventually
become known as Covid-19 began to spread in Wuhan, China, kicking off a
sequence of events that quite literally changed the world as we know it,
the global climate not excepted.
</p>
<p>
The most dramatic effect of Covid on climate change wasn’t the 8% drop
in annual greenhouse gas emissions caused by lockdowns and border
closures in 2020, however. It wasn’t the crash in oil prices, which
briefly went negative in April 2020. It wasn’t the delay of COP26 and of
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth
Assessment Report. And it wasn’t, sadly, a legacy of green stimulus
measures (some
<a href="https://www.naturefinance.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Green-Stimulus-Index-6th-Edition_final-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>good
efforts</u></a> notwithstanding).
</p>
<p>
Rather, it was in the way the world’s governments (especially the
largest and most powerful) responded to the virus, which
<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/an-introduction/" target="_blank">undermined
the very idea of multilateralism</a>, climate action included. This took
place along three main vectors: inertia on global financial rules, even
as long-acknowledged failings turned catastrophic; a renaissance in
industrial policy that may prove transformative for domestic fiscal
policy; and, at the intersection of both, deterioration of what we might
call geopolitics or “global solidarity.”
</p>
<p>
Evidence of this phenomenon can be found in nearly every aspect of the
global order. The
<a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/the-polycrisis-behind-a-lost-decade-of-poverty-reduction" target="_blank"><u>World
Bank in October</u></a> pointed to Covid as chief among a “polycrisis”
of “multiple and interconnected crises occurring simultaneously, where
their interactions amplify the overall impact.” Development gains have
almost slowed to a halt. Extreme poverty has <em><em>increased
</em></em>overall in low-income countries since 2014, after decades of
improvement, according to the World Bank’s analysis.
</p>
<p>
None of this, however, was an inevitable effect of Covid. Poor countries
got poorer, for the most part, because of norms and hard rules in global
finance that they have little control over — what a group of researchers
last year termed
“<a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/rripxx/v30y2023i4p1360-1386.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>financial
subordination</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
To understand why, a brief history: Developing countries during the
2010s were seeking new avenues of finance as traditional sources like
multilateral development bank loans, official development assistance,
and commercial bank loans waned. Many turned to the U.S. dollar
sovereign bond markets, and also to China; a few countries also turned
to commodity traders like Glencore and Trafigura, taking on opaque debts
to be repaid with their own oil and other commodities.
</p>
<p>
When the pandemic response shut down many kinds of economic activity in
2020, what World Bank researchers called a “fourth wave” of debt
followed. After a continuous series of debt surges from 1970 to 1989,
1990 to 2001, and 2002 to 2009, global debt markets had been relatively
stable for the preceding decade. What was different about this fourth
wave was that it was
<a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/377151575650737178-0050022019/original/DebtChapter1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largely
in developing countries</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
With Covid, the fourth wave turned into a tsunami. Countries everywhere
were paralysed by the pandemic, but the poorest ones lost critical
revenue from tourism, remittances, and some exports. On top of that,
they suffered the same lockdowns and illness that depressed local
economic activity and drained government budgets in many countries.
Unlike rich countries, developing countries had limited ability to dip
into reserves or raise money from the bond markets to keep their
citizens safe and tide over those who lost work.
</p>
<p>
Wealthy countries and lenders did little to ameliorate this stress. A
“Debt Servicing Suspension Initiative” facilitated by the G20 provided
some relief for 46 countries; China participated, too, granting
deferrals to some of its debtor countries. But private bondholders (who
were earning returns as high as 9%) and multilateral banks did not. The
debts still had to be paid, and by 2023, aggregate net capital flows
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/imf-world-bank-spring-meetings-need-to-get-four-things-right-by-lawrence-h-summers-and-n-k-singh-2024-04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>were
</u><u><em><em>negative</em></em></u></a><em> </em>for developing
countries — that is, more money flowed from poorer countries to richer
ones than the other way around.
</p>
<p>
Numerous governments defaulted on their debts in the wake of Covid,
including Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Ethiopia, and Suriname. But perhaps
just as bad, many, many more countries continued to pay their debts by
slashing their health and social welfare budgets just as they were
needed most. Low- and middle-income countries
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9944267/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spent
more</u></a> on debt servicing in 2022 than they spent on health in
2020, during the height of the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Tensions between the U.S. and China, meanwhile, became even more overt
around Covid, helped in part by accusations and recriminations over the
source of the disease. The two great powers were themselves deeply
changed. China emerged from its Covid Zero measures with
<a href="https://blogs.soas.ac.uk/china-institute/2022/12/15/chinas-zero-covid-strategy-causes-for-public-protests/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>public</u></a>

at a nearly unprecedented pitch and its engines of
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043951X23001864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>economic
growth </u></a>— domestic infrastructure and residential property —
faltering as vast local government debts

unmanageable</u></a>. The country’s central government renewed its focus
on an export-led growth model, but this time instead of cheap, low-tech
consumer goods, it was semiconductors, solar panels, and electric
vehicles.
</p>
<p>
It quickly became clear that the Biden administration would not be much
less hawkish towards China than Trump’s was. It largely focused inwards,
on tackling the disenfranchisement of formerly solid Democratic working
class constituencies that Trump had exploited and Covid deepened. These
were largely seen as an outcome of untrammelled free trade — especially
with China. But Covid lockdowns and the rush to regain normalcy in the
re-opening choked complex supply chains and logistics networks, driving
up prices around the world and helping to spark a global inflation
crisis that has yet to meaningfully abate in many parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
When Russia invaded Ukraine, energy prices shot up, particularly in
those countries reliant on imported oil and natural gas. This shook the
global fossil energy economy. Exports of liquified natural gas by the
United States to Europe skyrocketed, as European countries desperately
sought alternatives to Russian piped gas. Those same desperate Europeans
also bought LNG shipments that had been bound for countries like
Bangladesh and Pakistan,
<a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/eu-thirst-lng-puts-bangladesh-pakistan-the-dark-3140426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outbidding
</u></a>the poorer countries which then endured blackouts and further
hits to their financial reserves as they struggled to match the new EU
price.
</p>
<p>
Global energy price rises compounded the Covid supply-chain pressures
and monetary policymakers decided hiking interest rates was unavoidable.
While Russian troops tried to capture Kyiv in March of 2022, the U.S.
Federal Reserve — perhaps the most powerful U.S. entity for the rest of
the world — began hiking interest rates, taking them from just a quarter
of a percent before the invasion to more than 5% by mid-2023. This
strengthened the U.S. dollar, heaping more pressure on developing
countries trying to pay dollar-denominated debts. Meanwhile, in rich and
poor countries alike, the jump in living costs has helped drive
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/11/14/incumbents-are-losing-around-the-world-not-just-the-u-s/" target="_blank">backlashes
against incumbents</a>, and a surge in far-right populism.
</p>
<h3>
A Precarious Recovery
</h3>
<p>
Perhaps years ago, if we’d known that we’d see a spike in temperatures,
droughts, and storms alongside a flood of cheap solar panels and EVs,
technological breakthroughs in batteries, and a renewed interest in
industrial policy, it might have seemed that more urgent climate action
was assured. Instead, divisions have worsened. The agreement text from
this year’s United Nations climate conference is actually slightly
watered down from the last year’s statement on fossil fuel phaseout. A
special conference on biodiversity Cali, Colombia, finished last month
only when delegates had to catch flights home, and a desertification
conference hosted by Saudi Arabia finished this month with no group
statement.
</p>
<p>
Rachel Kyte, the UK special envoy for climate change, told an event
hosted by the Overseas Development Institute think tank that even as it
approached its 10-year anniversary, the 2015 Paris Agreement was more
fragile than it had ever been. Countries like the UK, she said, had been
inflicting “paper cuts” on developing countries for so long that the ill
will was becoming impossible to wave away.
</p>
<p>
“[W]e’ve also cherry-picked which international laws we want to stand
behind and then, which conflicts we believe the international law is
important for and not,” she added. “And you sit in the climate
negotiations and they know that you know that they know that you know.”
</p>
<p>
And yet a hopeful note sounding out of all of this has been the central
role of clean energy in many countries’ responses to the increasingly
fractious global landscape. Responses to Covid, as chaotic as they were,
demonstrated that governments can take decisive action. Although the
vast majority of Covid stimulus was climate-neutral at best; about a
trillion dollars’ worth of investments really

<p>
Renewed interest in energy security sparked by the Ukraine invasion has
been largely supportive of clean energy. Europe’s combined wind and
solar generation rose 10% in the first year after the invasion as the
bloc made its emissions reduction target more ambitious. Green
industrial policy introduced by the Biden administration has encouraged
other countries to see decarbonization as a competitive opportunity
rather than an obligation. And China’s doubling down on its
manufacturing of the

three</u></a>” — batteries, EVs, and solar panels — has created an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-china-climate" target="_self"><u>oversupply</u></a>
that spurred rapid uptake of clean energy in many countries.
</p>
<p>
Fractures, however, are rife. Too many countries have steep tariffs on
clean energy imports preventing them from taking advantage of cheap
Chinese components, adding to other barriers to clean energy generation,
such as the restrictive planning rules
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-05/japan-is-the-land-that-the-energy-transition-forgot?sref=63ZrW3mM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
Japan</u></a>, where renewable energy generation lags; even wind power,
where the country has ample potential, was
<a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/japans-missing-piece-of-clean-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtually
flat </u></a>for the decade to 2022. Tariffs on imports to the U.S.,
while helping to build a domestic industry, also slow the rate of
deployment. Globalized supply chains tend to be cheaper; a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study
in </u><u><em><em>Nature</em></em></u></a> estimated that they saved the
U.S. up to $31 billion in the 12 years leading up to 2020, while China
saved up to $45 billion, compared to a scenario in which domestic
suppliers were prioritized. Even with its rapid expansion in clean tech
manufacturing thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, it will take years
for the U.S. to catch up to China’s capabilities, while in the meantime,
tariffs will slow down installations.
</p>
<p>
For those in wealthier and more powerful countries, there’s at least a
chance of political shift. For countries under financial subordination,
there are hard limits to what can be achieved.
</p>
<p>
Geopolitical alignment is an increasingly sensitive question for
countries trying to avoid the pitfalls of appearing to be too close to
either China or the U.S. Auto manufacturing has become the site of
intense competition and tension, with the U.S. and EU putting punitive
tariffs on Chinese EV imports to compensate for “state subsidies.” The
introduction of the European carbon border adjustment mechanism this
year, which penalizes high-carbon imports so they don’t undermine the
continent’s carbon pricing regime, has introduced a new source of
tension around trade, particularly for African countries that rely on
exports to Europe and are nowhere near having their own carbon
accounting scheme that is a prerequisite to avoiding the surcharges.
</p>
<p>
We may only know in retrospect, but the supply bottlenecks and
inflationary surges associated with the Covid lockdowns and reopenings
may have been a kind of masked transition phase into a new, more
permanently supply-constrained world. Researchers at Potsdam Institute
and the European Central Bank
<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2821~f008e5cb9c.en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
new research </u></a>in March showing that climate change impacts will
raise general inflation by more than a percentage point by 2035.
</p>
<p>
The damage could be seen in the recent COP29 in Azerbaijan. Trust was
close to an all-time low over negotiations for a new target for finance
flows from wealthy to poor countries. After it ended with a
controversially low $300 billion target, Fiona Harvey of the Guardian
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/03/cop-climate-baku-talks-division" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called
it </u></a>the second worst COP of the 18 she’s attended, surpassed only
by the disastrous 2009 COP15 in Copenhagen, which ended with no
agreement at all. It can also be seen in the rebound in emissions since
2021.
</p>
<p>
While some hopeful shifts have emerged from the Covid era, the
increasingly febrile global atmosphere risks endangering our already
slim chances of protecting the habitable atmosphere. As climate impacts
worsen, pushing back on that axiom will be more difficult, but more
urgent. Combating climate change is such a monumental undertaking that
collaboration – in technology, manufacturing, knowledge, and diplomacy –
will be vital.

Jennifer Granholm has long been one of the most interesting figures in
the Democratic Party. A former federal prosecutor, she was the governor
of Michigan from 2003 to 2011, leading the state during the Great
Recession and subsequent auto bailout. Since 2021, she has been the 16th
U.S. Secretary of Energy. While there, she has overseen the department’s
transformation from an R&amp;D-focused agency to an aspiring engine of
industrial strategy.

On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob sits down with Secretary
Granholm in person in New York to conduct an exit interview, of sorts.
What climate policies is she most proud of — and what does she hope
Democrats do better next time? What does she wish that Democrats
understood about fossil fuels? And what does she think the outlook for
clean energy is in the years to come?

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And so one big question I have is like,
are we going to learn in the next few years whether these are actual
concerns to these folks and they want to preserve these programs?
Because it turns out, this is how you would try to create an EV industry
in the U.S. Or do they really just care about oil and gas and their
concerns with supply chains, with mineral supply chains, are just kind
of a tissue to cover up larger oil and gas concerns?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jennifer Granholm:</strong> I mean, obviously they’re very pro
fossil fuels. We know that. But I will say all of the rhetoric has been
about all of the above, an all of the above strategy. I mean everybody
from Doug Burgum — I mean, all of these Republicans on the Energy
Committee, they’ve all said that. So it just would be strange to turn
your back on everything that you have said all of this time.<br/> <br/>
And I don’t even think, honestly, I can — This is what I would say: I
think that the Trump administration, it seems, what do I know? I haven’t
talked to them personally, but I, it seems from all I can, they want to
reshore manufacturing. So if it’s not, if you eliminate the Inflation
Reduction Act, you got to replace it with something that’s going to
attract all of that investment. There has to be some industrial
strategy. Otherwise you’re just ceding the territory to China, which is
the thing you’re complaining about. So if you don’t like an
incentive-based strategy, which is really what the Inflation Reduction
Act is, I see he wants to put in a tariff-based strategy, if you just
want to do all sticks. I’m not sure that’s good for the economy overall,
but a blend of carrots and sticks, I’m sure most people would say are
important. And so, you know, maybe you call it something else, but you
got to get in a game, because otherwise our economic competitors are
only too happy to see that happen. Can I tell you a quick story? <br/>
<br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Yes, we have a little bit of time. This is
what this is for.<br/> <br/> <strong>Granholm:</strong> So when I was
finished being governor, I went to China to see what China was doing in
this clean energy space, because they were cornering the market on a lot
of these technologies, solar in particular. At the time, I went with
Securing America’s Future Energy, an organization that is focused on
competitiveness in this clean space. And we went to a presentation by a
bunch of mayors in China, mayors of provinces. And as we were standing
there watching the presentation, one of the mayors stands next to me,
and he says, “So when do you think the United States is going to get a
national clean energy strategy?” And I said, “Oh, I don’t know …
Congress …” And he looks at me, and he gets a big grin on his face, and
he says, “Take your time.”<br/> <br/> Because of course, they see our
passivity as their opportunity, right? So this is why what we’ve done,
what these laws have done, what the president has done, is so amazing.
So I get that you may have to put a different spin on whatever the new
administration wants to do, but ultimately, you have to have policies
like these if we’re going to be successful in reshoring manufacturing.

<p>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Secretary Granholm, welcome to Shift
Key.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jennifer Granholm: </strong>Thank you. Glad to be on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> So let’s start here. Can you just start by
setting the scene for us for what the Department of Energy has done over
the past few years, and what it has become? Because as I think about it,
and as we think about Trump again, I remember back in 2017 when, I
believe your direct predecessor, Secretary Perry, took over the office,
and he was very excited to talk about energy and to talk about fossil
fuels and to evangelize oil and gas. And then he had to learn that at
the time, DOE was really more of a national-labs-and-nuclear-weapons
type of agency. I feel like that’s less true today. So can you just set
the scene for us on how far we’ve come?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I mean, I can talk about the department,
yeah. But I’d love to also, at some point, talk about the outcomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Let’s talk about outcomes first, and then let’s
talk about the department.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>Great, great. So just at a level, I hope — I
know your listeners are savvy in this space, but just to put it in
perspective: It is astonishing what the Inflation Reduction Act and the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been able to do to build out clean
energy in the United States. It is mind-blowing. If you had told me —
I’m a former governor of Michigan, and when I was governor, we saw all
these jobs leave, all this manufacturing gone. It was just — and the
federal government just sat on its hands and did nothing, although when
the Obama-Biden administration came in, they saved the auto industry.
But every supply chain, every — and they were all going to Mexico, or
China, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
And so the hollowing out of much of the middle class and the
manufacturing, and I think this is one of the things that Trump really
picked up on. But across the nation, in industrial communities, small
towns that had a factory that left … So the Inflation Reduction Act and
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have caused now, as of today — and
this is so far, since the Inflation Reduction Act was only passed a
couple years ago — over 950 factories to come to America or expand in
America, building these products for this clean energy transition. That
is just mind-blowing to me. And those announcements are announcements.
Then there’s the groundbreakings, and then there’s the ribbon cuttings.
And so there’s been some groundbreakings and some ribbon cuttings, but
all of those are going to bear fruit over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>So during the Trump administration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>Exactly. And that’s, I mean, regardless of
who’s in the White House, this is really great for America, that we
have, now, industrial strategy that has reversed that track, that tide.
So that’s, in terms of outcomes, that is a huge outcome.
</p>
<p>
The second outcome that I think is really important is how much clean
generation that has happened. So this year, we will add 60 gigawatts of
clean electricity to the grid. That is more than double what we have
ever done — 30 Hoover Dams’ worth, is what I like for everyday folks to
understand the magnitude of what we are adding. And that trajectory is
going to continue as long as those incentives are in place, and it’s
going to be higher next year and next year. And so the goal that the
President came in with, with 100% clean electricity on the grid by 2035,
and to get to net zero by 2050, by 2030 we will have — just because of
these two laws, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act — we will have 80% clean electricity on the grid by 2030,
and we will have reduced GHG emissions by 40%. Now that doesn’t speak to
… the reduction in GHG doesn’t even speak to what the cities and states
and private sector is doing. So we’re hopeful that we can get to the
half, 50% reduction by 2030.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Do you think those trends will continue through
and despite Trump?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>Yeah, this is the question of the hour.
Here’s —
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And we can get more into this later, I just
wanted to stress test that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I’ll just say, I have hope that this will
continue, and I don’t think it’s irrational exuberance because of the
fact that those 950 factories, 85% are in red counties, red districts.
And because, you know, governors and members of Congress and, you know,
President-elect Trump will be able to oversee the fruition of people
hiring, steel going in the ground in these factories, it really would be
political malpractice to undo those incentives when it’s creating
everything that both parties have asked for, which is to reshore supply
chains, critical minerals for electric vehicles and other products. It’s
just, it’s doing the thing that America should do.
</p>
<p>
And so I am, I’m hopeful because of that, and I’m hopeful because of the
technologies that there’s bipartisan support for. So we know there’s
bipartisan support for nuclear, for example. We know there’s bipartisan
support for geothermal. We know there’s bipartisan support for
hydroelectric power. We know there’s bipartisan support for getting
critical minerals reshored, or at least the extraction and responsible
extraction and processing of them. So there’s a lot of areas that I
think there’s bipartisan support for, and therefore it will be difficult
for Congress to overturn or yank back from the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s talk about the office. In addition to
accomplishing those things — I remember in 2021, looking at the changes
that were being made the Department of Energy, some of the changes that
were in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and thinking, <em><em>DOE is
going to be a totally different agency by the end of this term, or even
just in a few years, than it was a few years ago</em></em>. Can you talk
about how the office has changed under your leadership?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> This is one of the reasons we’ve been able to
achieve those outcomes, is because we restructured the department. We
still have our national security mission, of course, and that’s very
important. And we still have the mission to clean up the legacy waste
sites from the Manhattan Project, as well. But we have completely
restructured to deploy, deploy, deploy.
</p>
<p>
We still have the labs, of course, doing all of the work that leads up
to deploying on the technologies that really are significant, and those
missions still occur. But we were given over $100 billion through these
acts, 60 new programs to restructure and focus the Department of Energy
on this clean energy transition, and that has utterly changed — we’ve
hired almost 1,000 people to be able to do that. We’ve created a whole
new vertical, a whole new Under Secretary for Infrastructure, which is
all about the infrastructure of this clean energy economy. So that
change, I think, has been significant.
</p>
<p>
We hired a bunch of people from the private sector to come in to
understand how technology — we don’t want to take a risk. For example,
through the Loan Programs Office, which I know you’re well familiar
with. You know Jigar Shah, who runs that, he doesn’t take a risk, they
don’t take a risk on the technology working. You know, the physics are
going to work, the chemistry is going to work. The niche that they
provide is great technology, do they have a business plan that is going
to ensure that they’re successful in the market? So we’ve hired a number
of people from the private sector to be the Sherpas on that and make it
work. And the results have been really quite astounding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It’s really become more of an industrial policy
department, in some ways, which is something that a lot of other
countries have. In fact, it’s something that most developed countries
have, or many of them have. Japan has one. Germany has one. But it’s
something the U.S. has historically not necessarily pursued in a
civilian agency. At least we have, we do DoD industrial policy forever.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yes, this is what’s so incredibly great about
this. You know, again, I say this with my hat as former governor of
Michigan: When we used to, you know, we were competing as states. States
had their own economic development agencies, but we didn’t have a
federal partner on any of it. It was like bringing a knife to a
gunfight, and we would see, you know, we can’t compete with the
industrial policy of China as a state, right? So the fact that we now
have a federal strategy that enables states to enhance, but that there
is a federal decision that we are going to get in the game. We’re not
going to be passive and allow other countries to eat us for lunch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> So how do we think that … how do you think that
these programs will fare under the next president?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I do think because — I think they are
durable, first of all, because one, we’re going to commit a huge amount
of the money we were given — 98% of the programs we were given, 60 new
programs under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act. We will have at least on one round of funding, 98% of
them, and we will have gotten commitments for all of these selections by
January 20. So there may be a couple that we’re not able to do because
they’re multi-year programs, etc., but we want that commitment. So that
creates one layer of durability.
</p>
<p>
And of course, the second layer of durability is that they, these
programs, are all going to stuff that Republicans have been calling for,
too. So for example, there’s been a lot of curious complaints about the
EV strategy of the administration because, it is said, all of the
critical minerals, and China produces the batteries and the critical
minerals. And that’s true. China has — but that’s why this strategy is
reversing that trend. You know, China’s cornered the market on
batteries, and now we’re make … I mean, of the 950 companies that I
talked about, over 400 of them are batteries or electric vehicle
companies that we’re building in the United States, you know, the anode,
the cathode, the separator material, the electrolyte, the critical
minerals, the processing of those minerals. That’s all coming back.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, and there is something … So have you
talked to Doug Burgum or Chris Wright? Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I hope I get a chance to talk to Chris
Wright. I’ve definitely talked to Doug Burgum in my role, and in his
role as governor. And he’s been an all-of-the-above guy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I think it’s interesting because one of the big
questions I have going into the Trump administration — in addition, I
should say, that there’s like, two buckets of questions, right? There’s
the, as you were saying, there’s a lot of durability, if you were to
look at conventional ways of assessing durability, in the department’s
programs, right? A lot of these programs are bipartisan.
</p>
<p>
Something we saw during the Trump administration was that the Office of
Management and Budget from the White House would publish these extremely
drastic budget cuts when they proposed a budget to Congress, and there’d
be all these news stories about how they wanted to cut the EPA budget by
half, and they wanted to cut the DOE budget, and they wanted to cut
NASA’s budget. And all these news stories would come out, and then six
months later, the Republican majorities in Congress would pass a budget,
and it would lightly top off all of the budgets, and all the funding
would go up, because it turns out the government largely does things
that Congress wants it to do, and there’s a lot of support in Congress.
</p>
<p>
That being said, it also seems like this administration is going to test
the limits of impoundment and what the president might be able to stop.
But once you put aside that bucket, when you hear Doug Burgum talk about
what his complaints with the Biden administration’s policies are, many
of them are not grounded in factual inaccuracy. I would say they’re …
for instance, the big point he made during the Republican primary debate
was about, if we switch to EVs, we’re going to make China more
important. We’re switching from OPEC to Sinopec, is, I think, his line.
That is exactly what the suite of policies that have been advanced in
this bill are supposed to do.
</p>
<p>
And so one big question I have is like, are we going to learn in the
next few years whether these are actual concerns to these folks and they
want to preserve these programs? Because it turns out, this is how you
would try to create an EV industry in the U.S. Or do they really just
care about oil and gas and their concerns with supply chains, with
mineral supply chains, are just kind of a tissue to cover up larger oil
and gas concerns?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I mean, obviously they’re very pro fossil
fuels. We know that. But I will say all of the rhetoric has been about
all of the above, an all of the above strategy. I mean everybody from
Doug Burgum — I mean, all of these Republicans on the Energy Committee,
they’ve all said that. So it just would be strange to turn your back on
everything that you have said all of this time.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t even think, honestly, I can — This is what I would say: I
think that the Trump administration, it seems, what do I know? I haven’t
talked to them personally, but I, it seems from all I can, they want to
reshore manufacturing. So if it’s not, if you eliminate the Inflation
Reduction Act, you got to replace it with something that’s going to
attract all of that investment. There has to be some industrial
strategy. Otherwise you’re just ceding the territory to China, which is
the thing you’re complaining about. So if you don’t like an
incentive-based strategy, which is really what the Inflation Reduction
Act is, I see he wants to put in a tariff-based strategy, if you just
want to do all sticks. I’m not sure that’s good for the economy overall,
but a blend of carrots and sticks, I’m sure most people would say are
important. And so, you know, maybe you call it something else, but you
got to get in a game, because otherwise our economic competitors are
only too happy to see that happen. Can I tell you a quick story?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yes, we have a little bit of time. This is what
this is for.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> So when I was finished being governor, I went
to China to see what China was doing in this clean energy space, because
they were cornering the market on a lot of these technologies, solar in
particular. At the time, I went with Securing America’s Future Energy,
an organization that is focused on competitiveness in this clean space.
And we went to a presentation by a bunch of mayors in China, mayors of
provinces. And as we were standing there watching the presentation, one
of the mayors stands next to me, and he says, “So when do you think the
United States is going to get a national clean energy strategy?” And I
said, “Oh, I don’t know … Congress …” And he looks at me, and he gets a
big grin on his face, and he says, “Take your time.”
</p>
<p>
Because of course, they see our passivity as their opportunity, right?
So this is why what we’ve done, what these laws have done, what the
president has done, is so amazing. So I get that you may have to put a
different spin on whatever the new administration wants to do, but
ultimately, you have to have policies like these if we’re going to be
successful in reshoring manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> What do you think is the trajectory — you
mentioned 60 gigawatts of clean generation coming online. What do you
think is the trajectory of clean energy under Trump?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well it, you know, if the Inflation Reduction
Act holds, those incentives don’t go away. The developers are going to
take advantage of it. I think it is inexorable that you will see
continued climb of clean energy generation. I, you know, I know there’s
a lot of talk about drill, baby, drill, etc. I mean, they have been
drilling, baby, drilling. There hasn’t been limits on that. They may
want to open up more auctions and more leases, but the private sector
has to be willing to actually put the capital investment into going into
those spaces. And the market is a global market, and they’re going to
respond to what is happening globally. So I think clean energy … I
believe strongly that if the Inflation Reduction Act stays, the clean
energy investments will continue to go on that upward trajectory in a
way that is astounding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s talk about fossil fuels for a minute. As
of when we’re recording this, the LNG study is not yet out. Can you give
us a sense of what we might hear when that study comes out, and what the
department has aimed to do with it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I’ll just say this. I’m going to wait
for the study to come out to speak to what its conclusions are, but know
that for everybody listening, we were looking at what the greenhouse gas
impacts are of all of the additional authorization that has been, and
the current authorization that has already been approved for export. We
have, we’re looking at what the impacts are from local communities who
bear both the economic, the jobs, as well as the adverse impacts to
that. We’re looking at what the global trajectory is of demand, and what
our allies might be needing in terms of liquefied natural gas. And
importantly, we’re looking at the impacts back home on the costs of
natural gas. We, you know, if we are producing little over 100 bcf a day
of natural gas, and you take a good chunk of that and export it, what
does that do to the prices at home for those who use it? And so we’re
looking at the costs at home.
</p>
<p>
So the study will come out soon. There will be a 60-day comment period,
so it will run into the next administration, obviously, but I think it’s
important to lay out what the study finds. Just the facts. These are,
this is done by our labs. These are just facts. And I think it’s
important for those commenters to comment on it so we have it for the
record, and potentially a future administration could make policy based
upon what the study reveals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> LNG has been such a big hot-button issue in this
administration, and to some degree it has dominated some of the
discourse around these questions. Have you been surprised by the degree
to which it’s dominated discourse, or surprised by the degree of the
backlash?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>Yeah, a bit, because of the amount that we
have already authorized for export. I mean, the pause on additional
authorizations does not impact in any way, shape, or form the amount of
exports we are doing. We have already built up and are exporting … we’re
the largest exporter in the world, 13 bcf, you know, billion cubic feet
per day. We are a powerhouse in exporting LNG, and we’ve authorized a
whole bunch more that is either under construction or seeking final
investment decisions, etc.
</p>
<p>
The amount we have approved is massive. And this is … this study was a
pause on <em><em>even more</em></em>, you know. So we’ve approved an
amount that is almost equivalent to what the U.S. the demand will be,
you know. So it doesn’t affect any of that. We didn’t pause any exports
at all. So have I been surprised? Yes, because of — But I understand
politically that some things aren’t necessarily based on the actual
facts. But people are afraid, maybe, that there will, that portends some
callback in existing authorizations or something, which it does not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> So often when you go back, and I’ve been going
back in and looking at the climate policy and energy policy from the
administration, and what the coverage of it has been at the time. And
what’s been striking — and I remember observing this when I was covering
these issues, but it has been really striking to go back and see it in
retrospect — is that the Biden administration was doing a lot at the
same time, right? It was trying to stabilize the fossil fuel industry
coming out of the Ukraine energy crisis. It was trying to help clean
energy. It was trying to reduce emissions. But there’d be this pattern
of, the Biden administration would pass the IRA, and a lot of the
coverage on the IRA focused on the fossil fuel leasing provisions in the
IRA, to the degree that I was like,<em><em> did they read the
law?</em></em> You know, are they aware of what the policies are in this
law? And then Biden would approve the Willow Project, or there’d be the
fight over the LNG, and that would dominate attention. That would get a
lot of coverage, and it would drive a lot of attention from climate
activists, too.
</p>
<p>
Did what Biden was trying to do during this administration break
through? Did what this administration was trying to do, did it break
through with the people who needed to hear it? Meaning on the renewable
side, on both sides, on the climate side and the fossil fuel side.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I would say no, it definitely didn’t break
through. But that’s more of a comment about our media environment,
right? I mean, for media, with all due respect …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> This is an interesting question. Yeah, I mean,
it ties into, like, what can the government do in terms of policy? How
much do people notice what’s happening in terms of policy?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I mean, unless there’s a massive controversy,
people are looking at, you know, TikTok and Instagram, and so the things
that get the big, you know, generate the most clicks are the ones that
have some backlash, right? So those are the things that people notice.
Do they notice the good news? No. Do people know, they have any idea
about the amount of factories that are coming to America, or expanding
in America? No clue. No clue. So that’s a question about, how do you do
that? How do you get the word out? I’ve been across the country and
almost every state you know, trumpeting this, but it still doesn’t rise
to the level of consciousness.
</p>
<p>
And maybe it’s because people aren’t so interested in it, but I think
that people want to see — I mean, the economy was the number one issue,
and if you’ve got a factory coming to your area, that should be a
positive, positive thing. But people don’t attribute it necessarily to
the Biden administration. Is that a failure on our part of not yelling
loud enough, etc.? Or is it a failure of the atomized media that we
have? It’s just it’s hard to know going forward.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, I think if it is a failure of the atomized
media, it is a rather ominous sign for politics that tries to build
things in the future. You’re the governor — you were the governor of a
state that had ties to the fossil fuel industry, not in that it was
extracting fossil fuels, but in that the main export, it uses them,
right? What do you think Democrats should understand about the fossil
fuel industry? And like, not only Democrats in government, but rank and
file Democrats?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well I think, first of all, I think it’s
important to understand the word transition. You know that we are in a
transition from a molecule-based fuel system to an electron-based fuel
system, to electrify. And that electrification, obviously, is so much
more healthy for the planet, and it creates huge job opportunities. But
the transition period, you know, we have 26 years between now and 2050,
when we need to get to net zero — and notice it says ‘net zero.’ The
fossil fuel industry is going to continue to exist. The net means that
we have to find the technologies that reduce, obviously, greenhouse gas
emissions from that fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
People, also Democrats, understand, if they live in one of these states,
that the fossil fuel industry provides a huge number of jobs, good
paying jobs, and so you can’t just come along and say, get rid of all of
that, because you’re talking about people and people’s economies and
communities and towns. So it, there has to be a vision of build, build,
build on the clean, and that market will expand, so that you can have a
reduction on the fossil side. But I don’t think that we’re going to be
fully rid of all fossil because I, and I think the technology will allow
for us to clean up the fossil fuel side of things.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Do you think that the voters, that rank and file
Democrats — even beyond Democrats, just the type of voters the Democrats
want to talk to — do you think they see this link between fossil fuels
and their livelihoods and their economies? A link that Republicans are
very eager to point to, but that I think Democrats sometimes avoid. Do
you think that people see fossil fuels and associate their economic
well-being with it?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> No, I don’t think they ,,, unless they live
in one of those communities, right? I don’t think they necessarily link
… I think people are really interested in reliable power, yeah, and
they’re interested in how much that reliable power costs. That’s, for
most people, they’re not looking, when they flip on the light switch, is
it something that’s coming from natural gas-powered? Or is it something
that’s coming from solar? People like the idea — and I can say this as a
former governor, communities love the idea of creating jobs that are
future-facing, that their kids will stay for. And the next generation,
the Gen Y, Gen Z, they’re, you know, they don’t want to work in an
industry that is polluting the planet. Many of them, I mean, some of
them — of course, I don’t want to generalize. But for the most part,
communities embrace these industries of the future. And so I think that
is something that people listen to, and they understand that this
transition is happening, and it is not just like flipping a light
switch, that there has to be a glide path so that the communities that
have powered us for the past 100 years can be part of powering us for
the next 100 years, but using clean. But that transition period has to
be one where you are sensitive to the fact that these many rural places
feel very threatened.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Democrats did a lot to help the fossil fuel
industry during this administration, to stabilize it — after the
pandemic, to stabilize it, after Ukraine, there was a Defense Production
Act in the beginning to help the fracking industry. There was the use of
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize gas prices and oil prices.
After Ukraine, the response they got from the fossil fuel industry was
nothing but vitriol, nothing but, <em><em>Biden doesn’t want us to
drill. We hate the tone coming out of this administration. We’re not
happy with this at all.</em></em> Did Democrats do too much for the
industry? Should they not have done what they did?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I don’t think Democrats … I don’t think
we did it for the industry. We did it for the people. So for example, on
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, you know, gas prices were bumping up to
$5 a gallon because of the dearth of supply globally as a result of
Russia’s fuel not being on the market. So we wanted to make sure that
people in the United States and around the world, but people in the
United States in particular, weren’t paying for Putin’s war, and so
releasing more supply obviously brought that down. I mean, today we’re
$2 under what it was during that height. So it worked. And we have
replenished the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a price that was much
more favorable to taxpayers. So it wasn’t, that wasn’t about saving the
industry. That was about saving people’s pocketbooks.
</p>
<p>
We did help our allies on liquified natural gas exports, and they were
reeling as a result, a couple of years ago, as you know, as a result of
the war and Putin weaponizing natural gas. So that had an impact on the
industry. It helped the industry. But our the strategy really is what’s
going to help people here in the United States.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> There’s two different attitudes toward the
fossil fuel industry, as — I’m going to generalize a little bit, but
when I look at climate folks, folks who work in this professionally, who
think about these issues day to day, whether they’re activists or
engineers, I think people’s attitudes break down into two camps. And one
of those camps is that the fossil fuel industry is a big enemy. They’re
a big enemy of the transition. They’re going to fight the transition at
all costs. They’re going to do everything they can to preserve fossil
fuels. And just look at their support of Donald Trump, right? What they
want from the Trump administration is shoring up demand because they
want to lock people into fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
And there’s another point of view that says, <em><em>Well, you know,
it’s not great, but the obstacles to the transition are more along the
lines of technology development and deployment. And the fossil fuel
industry, in the meantime, actually does provide a lot of energy for
people, and you can’t ignore that.</em></em> Where do you come down
between those two camps?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I definitely think that industries tend
to preserve their self-interest, right? And so the fossil fuel industry
is all about fossil fuels. And so if they view another type of energy,
cleaner energy, as a challenge, then they’re going to do everything,
which — I mean, that has proven throughout history to have been the
case.
</p>
<p>
I will say there are a couple of actors, several of the majors, who
maybe have a little more of the luxury of being able to do investments
in technologies that allow for a clean energy transition. That’s
encouraging. I mean, when I … there’s a big oil and gas conference in
Houston every year. And the first year I went, I was like, you guys, you
should transition to be diversified energy companies, not just oil and
gas. You guys have all of the resources. You’re the richest companies
around. Why don’t you being … why aren’t you investing more in
geothermal, for example, because you have the skill set. You’ve got, you
use rigs, you go, you understand about extracting energy from beneath
the surface. You’re experts in the subsurface. You got skill set. This
began the big blowback. How dare you come and tell us what we should be
doing? But it’s just realistic, and to be fair, some have, a lot have
not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Some that got into it have now backed off of it,
too, is the other thing, too. Because they’re just, the business is so …
like, even if some leaders in the company are like, well, electricity
looks like the future, we should get into it, the profit pattern’s
totally different. The margins are totally different. So they then wind
up getting back out, because fossil fuels just can be very profitable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> This is why, to me, this transition, we have
to almost overbuild on the renewable side, so that it is, so that it
were, we just have so much momentum there. And the cost, when you
overbuild, you’re scaling, your costs come down, and it becomes a game
of cost, right? Our natural gas is so cheap, and so that’s why it’s a
difficult thing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Right. This is like, in some ways, the good and
the bad, right? Is that we have all this cheap natural gas, which means
we’ve had fairly cheap electricity, right? And that means we attract a
lot of industry that is not going to Europe. For instance, China also
has cheap electricity because they subsidize it. They burn a lot of coal
at state subsidy. They do a lot of generation. I know it’s just a tricky
… it is tricky.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> The whole thing. It’s complicated. It’s not
binary. I mean, really, we have to think about it: Where do we want to
be in 2050? We want to be at net zero. How do we get there? How do we
back into that? And I think the electricity grid side of things will
come along very, very quickly. You know, it’s going to be difficult to
decarbonize heavy industry, and we’re working on strategies to do that.
You know, the building sector — really, really important to be able to
address that. So, bottom line is, it’s complicated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Clean energy and electricity, let’s move on. So
I think, as recently as 18 months ago, the word on electricity demand,
on electricity markets, and what was happening in electricity in the
U.S. was, yes, these AI companies are going to come along. They’re
building a lot of data centers, but they’re not going to slow down the
transition. I think that might have changed a little bit, that consensus
might have changed a little bit since then, or I think it’s a little
less clear, let’s say. What’s your view?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I think first of all, we know the demand is
going up, and data centers are a part of that. So is electrification of
transportation. So are all these 900 factories coming on. So there are a
number of reasons —
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Right, AI remains a relatively small percentage
…
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>— at the moment. But it’s, but there is no
doubt that it’s a growing part of it. We have managed increases in
demand in the past, and we will continue to do that going forward by
adding all of this additional power, which is why, you know, we just
need to continue to build generation. But what our conversations with
the hyperscalers on these data centers — first of all, we believe that
it’s really important to have these data centers, the AI data centers,
in the United States, for national security reasons. We need to hold on
to that. And if that’s true, and they build out these data centers, and
they need another, whatever, 20 gigawatts of power for the data centers
— bring your own power. BYOP. So bring your own clean power. Your
shareholders and your commitments to clean energy, all of them have
commitments like that.
</p>
<p>
So this is why you’re seeing these really interesting announcements
coming from Google and Meta and Amazon, etc., partnering with geothermal
companies like Sage and Fervo, partnering with small modular reactor
companies like Kairos, are turning on power. So it’s, to me, very
exciting that, not only that there may be, there’s an additive component
to this. And there’s a willingness on the part of the data centers to
actually pay a green premium for those, that addition, those additional
electrons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Do you hear that they are willing to … is the
willingness to pay that green premium durable? Because I do hear
concerns that basically, once Trump comes in, or in a year from now,
these companies are going to want to keep building AI data centers.
They’re going to be starved for power, and they’re just going to build
natural gas because it’s not coal, and they need the energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I think that there will be some temptation to
do that. And I think that while nuclear reactors, for example, are being
built, they may rely, there may be some reliance on natural gas to be
able to power — natural gas combined, perhaps with CCS, for example,
carbon capture …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah, Exxon just made this announcement. It’s
going to try to get into that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yes, exactly. But these companies themselves
have made commitments. I mean, Amazon’s commitment to clean has been
part of their ethos. So they can’t just rely upon that. They have got to
bring their own.
</p>
<p>
And let me just say one other thing, is that bringing their own and
paying a green premium for that, they recognize the backlash of adding
demand on a grid that is socialized across the rate base. They
recognize, they do not want to have protests because people’s rates are
going up because of this data center. And data centers, of course, they
are fantastic for construction jobs, but they don’t employ a huge number
of people. There are ripple effects, of course, in an industrial
cluster, but they’re worried about the backlash — as they should be, and
therefore bringing their own power and paying for it is a part of the
strategy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Thinking more broadly, the Biden administration
came in, and you came in with an interest in fixing issues in the U.S.
innovation and deployment chain, let’s say, and in the chain of
innovations, or the chain of scientific research, as it goes from the
lab and the national labs to eventually the marketplace. And one big
criticism, including from one thing that Jigar talks about the Loan
Programs Office is trying to do, is make sure that when we invent
technologies here, they don’t get then exported abroad, sold abroad, and
then made somewhere else and commercialized somewhere else. Today, in
2024, is that chain working? And what are the biggest problems with that
chain as you see them?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, there’s so many, there’s so many
opportunities for solving the biggest problem. So for example, we
launched eight Earthshots to be able to reduce the price for this
next-generation technologies like enhanced geothermal or floating
offshore wind platforms or clean hydrogen. If we can reduce the cost of
those technologies by 90% — and that’s what a lot of the labs are
working on — that makes them irresistible.
</p>
<p>
And that’s, making these advanced technologies irresistible is part of
the strategy. And that includes, you know, nuclear reactors. So we have
a whole office of technology transitions led by Vanessa Chan, who came
in from outside, and she has overseen all these liftoff reports for
these clean technologies that have, really, industry benchmarks about
where we should be and when we should be there. We feel really good
about the trajectory of these technologies as a result of that work, and
the work that’s being done by the labs.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of knotty problems, though, that are beyond those
particular technologies. One of the knottiest problems, honestly — and I
mean knotty, K-N-O-T-T-Y — is the grid getting the connection through.
And I think that that is a problem that we’re working on, using AI to
solve. But there needs to be a much greater emphasis on how to get the
RTOs and the ISOs to get more power online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> What technology in the clean energy … actually,
let me just ask one follow up, which is, do you think that those
Earthshot programs will be sustained through the next administration?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I do because, I mean, if there’s a big
support for hydrogen, for example. So how do we get the cost of hydrogen
down? I think you can cherry pick, I suppose. But you know, carbon
management is one of the Earthshots. So how do you reduce the cost of
that so a lot of the technologies have support?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Thinking across the full spectrum, full
portfolio of technologies that the DOE has supported or gotten engaged
on in the past four years, what technology are you most excited about?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, I’m certainly super excited about the
deployment of solar that has just been, just a rocket ship, which is
very, very cool. I personally love, and would love to see a greater
investment by the next — we would have done this if we had the
opportunity to serve — I think, a greater investment in geothermal,
enhanced geothermal. I think that has huge promise, to be able to do
that. And I would also want to see a greater investment, a consistent
investment in the grid. So we got, there’s $70 billion that is focused
on the grid through these laws. And we were able to do spot efforts, to
do reconductoring and get more power across existing lines, to do
grid-enhancing technologies, to do undergrounding, all of that. But a
consistent investment in the grid, kind of like what we have for the
Highway Trust Fund. If we had a, we have a national grid, it’s, you
know, the transmission and distribution miles, 7 million miles, and 75%
of the grid is over 25 years old. We need a consistent investment for
both to deal with these extreme weather events, cyber, and make, just
making sure that we are upgrading the poles on which this electricity is
carried.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It is so different, and it’s interesting
compared to highways. Because highways, it is a form of transmit, right?
I mean, yeah, we move energy around on the highways. Highways are this
big national system. The highways are also publicly owned. The grid is
not. Do you think that’s an issue?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, some of the grid, I mean, you know, it
depends, right? I think that we just need to think about it differently.
Electricity is just a fundamental human need, like transportation on a
road, or even more importantly. So I just think we have to think
differently about how we support the grid and this scattershot … and I
know it’s, obviously it’s a federalism issue, as well. But we have a
system like that for the roads, and we should take a look at that.
There’s state roads, and the money goes to the states and they do it,
and then there’s federal roads, you know, federal highways. I think we
can borrow lessons, I’ll just say that, from what we have done with
other infrastructure to support the grid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Looking back, I think one of the big promises,
one of the big claims that Biden made coming into office was that
government was going to do big things again. It was going to intervene
and help the economy in big, strategic, supply-and-demand-oriented ways,
right? It was going to bring back factories. It was going to bring back
jobs. It could, government could be a major force for good in people’s
lives, and that this would not only be good for the country in a kind of
broad way, but also help defeat Trumpism.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, Donald Trump is about to be president again. But I also think
the Biden administration did go much further in its economic policy than
maybe the Obama administration did outside of healthcare. What did you
learn from this go around? What did you learn from this outing at trying
to do economic and industrial policy at the federal level, and trying to
do big things with the government’s power?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> You know, when I was done being governor, I
wrote a book about this. It’s called <em><em>The Governor’s
Story</em></em>, where I was lamenting the fact that we didn’t have
national strategy to be able to create jobs in our states. And the fact
that the troika of laws — I would include the CHIPS and Science Act, as
well — but there are three basic laws that are the basis for this table
of industrial strategy, and that it has worked so well.
</p>
<p>
I feel like, you know, all of the folks who have in the past been total
free market, “free market” players, government shouldn’t be involved, we
shouldn’t be picking, “winners or losers,” or all of that, and allowing
all these other countries to take our jobs. I think people have now seen
this play out, the fact that you don’t have any hands on and other
countries are playing. And I have, I have learned, and I hope others see
that had, the government can play an enabling role for actually creating
jobs in this country and making us competitive. Who knew policy actually
works?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I hear that …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I hear a “but” coming.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Kamala Harris, still, though, did not win the
presidential election. So I think, to some degree, the Biden
administration has proved you can do these things, and that they elicit
a response. I think, unfortunately, what it’s also demonstrated is that
this might be somewhat disconnected from political outcomes. So what
lesson do you learn from that?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I mean, yeah. Lesson A: It works, yeah.
Lesson B: How do you, how do you communicate that in a way that people
understand that it’s working? How do we, yeah, how does that happen?
It’s that. It’s back to the question we started to talk about at the
front end. I wish I was a great communications guru and I could tell you
how to do it. It’s one of those things that you almost have to, because
it was so soon, in the results-bearing part of this strategy, meaning
that you haven’t, people haven’t been hired for all those factories yet
because they’re still under construction, or they’re still being
contracts.
</p>
<p>
I still feel like it’s not over yet. The story’s not over yet. In the
immediate, yes, there was a communications gap because people didn’t
believe it. And I think people are angry, and they don’t trust
government to begin with. And so if you’re coming in as a candidate
saying that your government’s bad and they don’t believe you, and I’m
going to fight for you, that’s a more compelling message than, yeah, we
we have all these factories that are just starting. You need to wait a
few years, but it’s gonna happen, I swear. So how do we communicate
that? You’re in the communications business — tell me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Well, do you think it was a mistake to
communicate so many of these changes, so many of these policies were
communicated through manufacturing — I mean, it’s what we’re doing right
now. Not many voters actually work in manufacturing. We have a largely
services-dominated economy. Was that a mistake?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I’m sort of manufacturing-centric.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>I was gonna say, in some ways, because of
governor of Michigan, you have an anomalous …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Totally. This, yeah, it’s not, it’s not how
everybody else sees it, for sure. And I totally, I totally hear you on
this. So here’s, you know, here’s another data point, is that — or
factor: Part of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law was to give people the ability to weatherize their
homes, to have rebates for appliances that made them pay less on their
bills. The cool thing about this was that, is that 49 out of the 50
states have said, yes, I want that program, and they’re applying for the
funding to make that happen. But it’s just happening now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I was going to say, I remember looking at the
timelines for this and being like, they’re not going to get that out by
the election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it’s just, the four-year period
of time is just such a speck on the timeline that’s necessary to
actually see it to fruition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> What do Democrats need the government to do that
it cannot do, or that it has not been able to do?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Besides communicating these, the successes,
and making sure that we can move more quickly on …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Communicating, or, yeah, maybe it’s that these
were great rebate programs, and also, the law passed in August 2022, and
we’re just getting them out now, right? Like, it took two years to get
through that whole process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yeah, and that is a, that’s an issue, I
think, that government has to deal with. In general, when you have a new
program, you’ve got — rightfully so — all of the oversight, and making
sure. And then the states have — if you push something through to the
states, this is the same thing with the NEVI program, the vehicle
program went to the states.
</p>
<p>
We have oversight on the federal level. States have oversight on the
state level. It’s a new program. So, for example, for electric vehicle
chargers, the NEVI program was to get these chargers to the hardest
spaces, the spaces where no private sector entity would go, where there
was no electricity. So the contracts took a while to figure out, and how
to get them, and the states had to figure out their own processes. So
they’re starting, we have 24,000 coming online from the NEVI program.
But again, they will come online over the next couple of years — years.
So the slowness of the systems, that is an inherent challenge.
</p>
<p>
If you move too fast, though, then you end up making mistakes. You don’t
want to see some wrongful spending. So it is, I mean, government takes,
the government, wheels of government, eventually they’ll get it right.
There’s a lot of oversight. You want to make sure there’s no waste,
fraud, and abuse, but it may not happen on the convenient timelines of a
four-year term.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I understand how, you go slow, and it avoids
mistakes, and you get your one shot to do things, I will say, looking
back, the times when the government has been able to pass policies that
resulted in political wins — and specifically, when Democrats were able
to expand the government’s powers in ways that result in political wins,
to build things, do big things, they did them pretty fast. The 1930s,
like, the New Deal was a program, right? Yeah, all the LBJ programs were
relatively fast.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yes, I totally agree. And in history, there
was less concern about a lot of the stuff that, yeah, that there have
been embedded processes. I mean, it’s, I think, immediately, of the DOGE
efforts to try to reduce bureaucracy. And honestly, there is truth to
that. There should be some reduction of the steps it takes to get
something accomplished. And there needs to be sort of a value-stream
mapping of the bureaucratic systems. This is true.
</p>
<p>
We need to speed up permitting. We know we need to do that. And you
know, the friction, the litigation, the NIMBY issues, in addition to the
the government’s internal processes, it’s just too much. So can there be
streamlining to make things move more quickly? There can be, and I think
that should be a focus, as well, for Democrats, not just Republicans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> After four years at the nerve center of
decarbonization in the government, what do you think is the biggest
obstacle to decarbonization, and to doing the energy transition?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I think right now, I mean, I would say the
most immediate big obstacle is that we have 3.7 terawatts of clean
energy waiting to get into the queue, to be, build out that generation
from the transmission point of view. If I could tackle one thing, one
thing quickly, it would be the interconnection queues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Wow. And so you would be willing to pay, you
would be willing to make other concessions to handle transmission?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I would be. And then the, I would, there’s
one other thing I would say, is, I would want to invest much more in
baseload power, baseload clean power. So bigger investment in
geothermal, bigger investment in hydroelectric — even distributed
hydroelectric, you know, making dams where they don’t already exist,
stuff like that that really are … you know, I believe nuclear is a
really important part of the clean energy future. And those nuclear
reactors, small modular reactors, I think are really important. I’d
continue to invest in them. I would also continue to invest in fusion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> There’s a big tradeoff that the administration
has kept dealing with, I think, or that it has kept running up against
during the past four years, and to some degree, is really inherent in
the design of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is, when you
decarbonize, when you seek to make this transition happen, do you
optimize for deployment and commercialization, or do you optimize for
reducing emissions?
</p>
<p>
I think the clearest version of this tradeoff is with the hydrogen tax
credit, where there is a tradeoff between getting as many electrolyzers
out there as possible, trying to build as much electrolyte electrolysis
capacity on the grid as you can, versus making sure that those
electrolyzers don’t indirectly increase emissions across the national
economy. In that case, but even more broadly, how do you come down? If
there’s a tradeoff between deployment and reducing emissions, where do
you come down?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I don’t like the binary choice. I will say
this: I’m very big on actual deployment, knowing that there will be
continuous improvement on the technologies that are being deployed,
including GHG emissions. I just think that people need to get used to, I
mean, you know, when you put out a product for the first time, there’s
always going to be things that you want to improve on, and because the
overall goal is to reduce emissions, that’s got to be a primary thing of
the product that is being put to market. So I think both have to happen,
but the deployment is is utterly priority for me. Get it out, and then
improve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Do you think … are the technologies ready, at
this point, to think about reducing emissions? Or do we just need to
deploy a lot?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Well, if you’re talking about electrolyzers,
we still have to get these hubs up and running. And this is another
thing, waiting for guidance on the tax credit associated with hydrogen
is, is a whole ’nother thing. But, but the bottom line is, once they’re,
I mean, the whole point about doing hubs, for example, in hydrogen, and
using fuels that are either renewable or natural gas with carbon capture
or nuclear — the bottom line is, we’ve got to get these hubs, are the
places where we’re going to experiment about what works and what doesn’t
work. We’ve got to get the products in the hands of those who are going
to be using them so that we can learn from them. New technology requires
deployment in order to learn, in order to improve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Looking back on the IRA — and to some degree,
this troika of laws, but really the IRA — what is your biggest regret
about how they played out?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> My biggest regret is that there wasn’t, we
weren’t able to get consistent investment in the grid through the IRA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>From the, from the point of view of the law
being designed …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>Yeah, from the design of it. That could be
something that that is worked on in the years to come.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> What’s your biggest regret on implementation of
the law? Speed, clearly,
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Speed, yeah. Trying to get through all of the
hoops that you need to get through to do it, right? Why was it so slow?
Again, because of all of — let me just say, I’m super proud of the work
that our team has done, and the fact that we will have 98% of the
funding out from these rounds of funding. That is amazing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>I’m going to ask you what you’re proudest of.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> But it is, I regret we weren’t given the
opportunity to serve in a second term to make sure that we were able to
carry this forward, and that people can see that the benefits of these
laws actually create an industrial strategy that reshores manufacturing,
and it generates clean electricity and creates opportunity for
communities all across the country.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Ultimately, the IRA did a ton of industrial
policy through the tax code, and then it did a ton of grants and loans
through DOE. And I think there could be criticisms of the speed of DOE
getting loans out, let’s say.
</p>
<p>
I mean, something I’ve heard from companies is like, look, LPO is — $400
billion of loan authority, they only got out $54 billion. That number
might go up a little bit in the next few days. But I’ve also heard
criticism that we tried to do all this stuff through the tax code, and
it just took a long time to get that tax guidance out, and we were
trying to jam a lot through a relatively small tax policy office. What
would you change … if there were to be another attempt at industrial
policy, be it on climate or anything else, right? Because we want to do
… like, Democrats do want to have goals for other sectors of the
economy. What would you change about that implementation, or that way of
writing the law, to make sure that industrial policy is effective in the
U.S. government as it exists?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> It’s hard for me to sa,y this is a process
that I would remove from the system, because it, we have so many
technologies, so many agencies involved, and I think that there needs to
be a comprehensive look at it. I do think that in a next iteration,
incentivizing or removing waste streams from permitting has got to be a
priority to get this stuff deployed. As I say, incentivizing investment
in the grid has got to be a priority. Incentivizing investment,
specifically, in baseload clean technologies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> How would you incentivize those things without
just winding up in another slow process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> So tax code’s a little more efficient, yeah.
So the tax code, I think, gets the private sector to sit up and take
notice, and move, yeah. And so doing it through the tax code, as opposed
to grants or loans, that happens, assuming that folks are but the
guidance —
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>This time it did take long, a long time for the
guidance to come.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Yeah, for some. I mean, for like, solar stuff
that we’ve, you were used to, instead of being incentivized in the tax
code, that all obviously went very quickly and will continue to move.
But it’s just, it’s the startup of these things where we haven’t written
guidance before, where it’s a technology that has subsets of supply
chains, what’s involved that, you know, and you have a small office. So
I’d invest in the office to be able to expand the ability to get these
through a little more quickly. But I think that ultimately, even though
it takes a little bit of time, it works, and it will work, and we will
see the benefits of this over the next few years, and I hope people
recognize the incredible courage that it took for Joe Biden to act,
create industrial policy in America where we had not done it before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> What are you proudest of?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I’m proud to work for this administration,
for this president. And I’m really proud of our team, that we have been
able to do so much in so short of amount of time, with all new programs.
It is an amazing, amazing thing to have been in this position at this
time. I feel so utterly lucky, and I hope the next guy sees it for the
jewel that it is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>I think you’re in this role for another 35, 36
days.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I think it’s like 26 working days.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> After that, what sort of problems are you
thinking of next?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> Oh, I’m still thinking of all of these
problems. I’ll still be active in this space in some way, shape, or
form.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Is there a particular set of problems you’re
eager to tackle?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> I don’t know what’s going to … I have no idea
what I’m going to be doing next, but it’s got to be in this basic work.
In the clean space is where I will be.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> So at the end of every episode, we ask — Jesse
and I, my co-host, do an upshift or a downshift. You just pick one. And
an upshift, you pick something from the news or something that you’ve
encountered recently that either is making you feel more upbeat about
the energy transition, or more downbeat about the energy transition,
about our ability to make it happen, about its ability to, our ability
to decarbonize the economy. And so to conclude, I wanted to ask you, do
you have an upshift or a downshift to share with us?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm:</strong> My upshift is that I am optimistic about the
durability of these programs that I think, regardless of who’s in the
White House, it is inexorable, this clean energy transition — because,
because the Inflation Reduction Act has made investing in America
irresistible, because there’s bipartisan support, and because of all of
the mayors and the governors and the members of the, members of the
private sector who have raised their hand and said, We got this. We’re
taking the baton.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Secretary Granholm, thank you so much for
joining us today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Granholm: </strong>I appreciate it. Thank you, Rob.

members wrestle with grief in aftermath of Wisconsin school
shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MADISON, Wis. — Community members in Wisconsin continued to wrestle
with grief and called for change in the aftermath of a school shooting
that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six others. </p>
<p>Several hundred people gathered outside the Wisconsin State Capitol
for a vigil Tuesday night to honor those slain at Abundant Life
Christian School in Madison the day before, with some passing candles to
each other and standing close against the winter chill. </p>
<p>Among those in attendance was Naomi Allen, 16, who was in a nearby
classroom Monday when a 15-year-old girl attacked people in a study hall
before fatally shooting herself. </p>
<p>“It’s doesn’t matter who you are or where you are, something like
this could happen. There’s nothing that is going to exempt someone,”
Allen said at the vigil. </p>
<p>Allen’s father, Jay Allen, reflected on the dangers students face
these days. </p>
<p>“When I was in school these things never happened,” he said. “This
country at some point needs to take mental health seriously and we need
to pour resources into it. We really need some changes in the way we
handle that issue.” </p>
<p>The motive for the shooting appears to be a “combination of factors,”
Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said Tuesday as he appealed to the
public to call in to a tip line and share what they might know about the
shooter. </p>
<p>He offered no details about what that motive might be, though he said
bullying at Abundant Life Christian School would be investigated. He
also said police are investigating writings that may have been penned by
the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, and could shed light on her actions. </p>
<p>“Identifying a motive is our top priority, but at this time it
appears that the motive is a combination of factors,” Barnes told
reporters. </p>
<p>Two students among the six people wounded Monday remain in critical
condition. Officials have declined to disclose the names of the
victims. </p>
<p>“Leave them alone,” Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said. </p>
<p>The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in
recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut;
Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. </p>
<p>The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and
frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to
doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings
have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. </p>
<p>School shootings by teenage females have been extremely rare in U.S.
history, with males in their teens and 20s carrying out the majority of
them, said David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting
Database. </p>
<p>Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school —
prekindergarten through high school — with approximately 420 students.
Barbara Wiers, the school’s director of elementary and school relations,
said the school does not have metal detectors but uses cameras and other
security measures. </p>
<p>Barnes said police were talking with the shooter’s father and other
family members, who were cooperating, and searching the shooter’s
home. </p>
<p>The shooter’s parents, who are divorced, jointly shared custody of
their child, but the shooter primarily lived with her 42-year-old
father, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law
enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on
the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss
the ongoing investigation. </p>
<p>Madison resident Cristian Cuahutepitzi said he attended Tuesday’s
vigil to let the families of the victims know “we’re thinking of them.”
He said his uncle’s two daughters go to the school. </p>
<p>“They’re still a little bit shook,” he said. </p>
<p>Joe Gothard, the superintendent of the Madison Metropolitan School
District, said at the vigil that the tragedy happened less than two
blocks away from his childhood home. He said it wasn’t enough to say the
district would work on safety. </p>
<p>“We need to connect like we are tonight, each and every day and make
a commitment that we know we’re there for one another, hopefully to
avoid preventable tragedies like yesterday,” he said. </p>
<p>A prayer service was also held Tuesday night at City Church Madison,
which is affiliated with the school. </p>
<p>Several teachers from the school prayed aloud one by one during the
service, speaking into a microphone and standing in a line. One middle
school teacher asked for courage, while another sought help quieting her
own soul. </p>
<p>“God, this isn’t a Abundant Life Christian School tragedy,” said
Derrick Wright, the youth pastor at the church. “This is a community
tragedy. This is a nation tragedy.”</p>

to Earth for 2 stuck NASA astronauts delayed until March</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, florida — NASA’s two stuck astronauts just got their
space mission extended again. That means they won’t be back on Earth
until spring, 10 months after rocketing into orbit on Boeing’s Starliner
capsule. </p>
<p>NASA on Tuesday announced the latest delay in the homecoming for
Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. </p>
<p>The two test pilots planned on being away just a week or so when they
blasted off June 5 on Boeing’s first astronaut flight to the
International Space Station. Their mission grew from eight days to eight
months after NASA decided to send the company’s problem-plagued
Starliner capsule back empty in September. </p>
<p>Now the pair won’t return until the end of March or even April
because of a delay in launching their replacements, according to
NASA. </p>
<p>A fresh crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return,
and the next mission has been bumped more than a month, according to the
space agency. </p>
<p>NASA’s next crew of four was supposed to launch in February, followed
by Wilmore’s and Williams’ return home by the end of that month
alongside two other astronauts. But SpaceX needs more time to prepare
the new capsule for liftoff. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier
than late March. </p>
<p>NASA said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up
the replacement crew in order to keep the flights on schedule. But it
decided the best option was to wait for the new capsule to transport the
next crew. </p>
<p>NASA prefers to have overlapping crews at the space station for a
smoother transition, according to officials. </p>
<p>Most space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a
full year.</p>

<h2 id="police-look-for-motive-in-latest-us-school-shooting">Police look
for motive in latest US school shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Police in Madison, Wisconsin, said Tuesday that they were working to
establish a motive for the shooting at a small, private Christian school
that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six other people.</p>
<p>“Identifying a motive is our top priority,” Police Chief Shon Barnes
said of the shooting Monday that he called a “hurting and haunting
situation.”</p>
<p>Police were trying to verify a document posted online by the
15-year-old shooter, who apparently died of a self-inflicted wound. </p>
<p>Authorities said the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, was a student at the
Abundant Life Christian School, which has an enrollment of just over 400
students from kindergarten to high school. She opened fire in a study
hall late Monday morning.  </p>
<p>“We don’t know nearly enough yet,” Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told
reporters Tuesday about the shooting.  </p>
<p>Rhodes-Conway also said it was too early to determine whether the
shooter’s parents, who were cooperating with the police investigation,
would face criminal charges. </p>
<p>“We have to allow law enforcement the time and space for a careful
and methodical examination,” she said. </p>
<p>Barnes said Tuesday that several schools across the Madison
metropolitan area “were targeted by false threats, often known as
swatting.” He said police and the school district were working together
to determine who initiated the scheme. </p>
<p>The mayor lashed out at reporters’ requests Tuesday for more
information about the victims. </p>
<p>“I’m going to say this and then we’re done,” she said. “It is
absolutely none of y’all’s business who was harmed in this incident.
Please have some human decency and respect for the people who have lost
loved ones or were injured themselves or whose children were injured.
Just have some human decency, folks.” </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking in Maryland, said, “Our nation
mourns for those who were killed, and we pray for the recovery of those
who were injured.” </p>
<p>The vice president said stronger gun controls were needed.  </p>
<p>“Solutions are in hand,” she said, “but we need elected leaders to
have the courage to step up and do the right thing.” </p>
<p>President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that the shooting was
“shocking and unconscionable.” </p>
<p>“Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom,” he said.
“Students across our country should be learning how to read and write,
not having to learn how to duck and cover.” </p>
<p>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers ordered flags to be flown at half-staff
to honor the shooting victims.  </p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

Senate to vote on bill that fuels possibility of Chinese drone ban</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The 2025 defense spending authorization bill is coming
up to a final vote in the U.S. Senate. As the American Northeast buzzes
with drone sightings and fears of foreign surveillance, the bill moves
to ban products from the world’s largest drone-maker: China.</p>
<p>In a procedural vote on Monday, senators voted 83-12 in favor of
moving to a full vote on the National Defense Authorization Act, a
massive piece of annual legislation that sets priorities and authorizes
funding for the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>A provision within the 2025 NDAA aims to create mechanisms for
further oversight and prohibition of the use of Chinese drones while
working to increase drone supply chain resilience within the U.S. and
partner countries.</p>
<p>The bill mandates an investigation into two Chinese drone
manufacturers, DJI and Autel Robotics, with the aim of placing them on
the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) “Covered List.” This would
prevent their use in telecommunications industries. Another section
calls for the Department of Defense to regularly disassemble and analyze
the components of DJI drones.</p>
<p>The provision on drones draws in part from earlier anti-Chinese drone
legislation introduced by Republican Representative Elise Stefanik and
Senator Rick Scott. These bills received bipartisan support, showing how
concerns over the risk that Chinese drones pose to U.S. national
security have united a politically divided Congress.</p>
<p>“DJI drones pose the national security threat of TikTok, but with
wings,” Stefanik said. “This Chinese-controlled company cannot be
allowed to continue to operate in the U.S.”</p>
<p>During an interview on Fox News, Democratic Representative Raja
Krishnamoorthi described how he collaborated with Stefanik to draft
legislation on Chinese drones to be included in the NDAA.</p>
<p>“These Chinese-manufactured drones allow for the CCP, the Chinese
Communist Party, to access data in a backdoor manner and ultimately
surveil Americans,” Krishnamoorthi said.</p>
<p>China’s DJI dominates the production and sale of household drones,
with 2021 estimates suggesting that the company accounts for 76% of the
worldwide consumer market and about 90% of the U.S. market. While more
companies have emerged in past years, DJI still controls the largest
share of the market.</p>
<p>This gives the U.S. an increased imperative to diversify the domestic
drone economy, Carlos Gimenez, chairman of the House Homeland Security
Committee’s Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“We have to go a little cold turkey on this one. To say, ‘No, we
can’t buy that anymore,’” Gimenez said. “You have to look for other
suppliers, which then will slowly incentivize American companies to
start building them.”</p>
<p>While the Chinese drone ban has bipartisan support within Congress,
it faces pushback from drone enthusiasts and nongovernmental
organizations that oppose a blanket ban on Chinese drone products.</p>
<p>Brandon Karr, spokesperson for the nonprofit Law Enforcement Drone
Association (LEDA), supports the development of stricter and more
rigorous data security regulations for drones rather than an all-out
ban, which could pose problems for American law enforcement and safety
agencies.</p>
<p>Karr has written to Congress, advocating for agencies to develop
their own protocol and oversight for drone data security and to maintain
their right to use Chinese drones while minimizing their risk.</p>
<p>LEDA leads training on drone operation and best practices for public
safety and law enforcement. All 30 of the drones the group uses for
training are made by Chinese companies.</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, over 90% of public safety agencies in the nation
and worldwide today are utilizing Chinese aircraft,” Karr said. “So in
the event that a bill like this would go fully through and would
potentially ban the use of Chinese drones for public safety, it’d be
catastrophic for the public safety drone industry.”</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of Chinese drones is their low cost, especially
when compared with American models. Karr told VOA that he’d rather use
American products, but that domestically produced drones were double the
price of those made in China and included more maintenance fees.</p>
<p>“There’s not a law enforcement entity across the United States that
would rather fly a Chinese aircraft over an American if they were
competitively priced,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to LEDA, the California Fire Chiefs Association, the Air
Public Safety Association and other groups have written to Congress
saying the bill will harm them, with most citing concerns over cost.</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA in August, Republican Senator Marco Rubio
called Chinese drones “a huge vulnerability,” and said that data
security regulations would not address the security risks of Chinese
drones given their frequent software updates.</p>
<p>People “just want drones, and these are the cheapest ones they can
find,” said Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of
state in the next administration. “We need to help incentivize the
development of alternative manufacturers that are cost effective for law
enforcement, for utility companies, for others.”</p>
<p>DJI has not yet responded to VOA’s request for comment on the latest
version of the NDAA, which could ban the company’s drones.</p>
<p>However, when votes were taken to include a ban of DJI drones in the
NDAA in the House of Representatives earlier this year, DJI
representatives told VOA that the moves “suggest protectionism and
undermine the principles of fair competition and an open market.”</p>
<p>“Our drones have enabled the growth of entire industries, empowering
small businesses in sectors such as agriculture, real estate, and
transportation. These businesses depend on the accessibility of DJI’s
drone technology to thrive. We believe that innovation, security, and
privacy can coexist and are essential to advancing the drone industry
and the interests of all stakeholders,” wrote DJI representatives.</p>
<p>DJI has consistently denied claims that it sends drone data to the
Chinese government.</p>

Congress lines up stopgap bill to avert partial government shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress
unveiled a stopgap measure on Tuesday to keep federal agencies funded
through March 14, which would avert a partial government shutdown that
would otherwise begin Saturday. </p>
<p>The measure would likely keep the roughly $6.2 trillion federal
budget running at its current level, funding such programs and
activities as military operations, air traffic controllers, and federal
regulators for areas ranging from drug safety to securities
markets. </p>
<p>Rank-and-file members of Congress will now review the measure’s
details, with some hard-line Republicans in the House of Representatives
already signaling opposition to some elements, meaning that some
Democratic votes will likely be necessary for passage. </p>
<p>It was unclear when the Republican-controlled House would vote, but
if successful, the Democratic-majority Senate would aim to take up the
legislation before Friday’s midnight deadline and send it to President
Joe Biden to sign it into law. </p>
<p>The package includes $100.4 billion in new emergency funding to help
states including North Carolina and Florida recover from devastating
hurricanes, as well as Western wildfires and other recent
disasters. </p>
<p>That money would include $29 billion for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency’s disaster relief fund; $21 billion for aid to farmers
hit by flooding and other losses; and $10 billion in economic assistance
for them, according to the legislative text. </p>
<p>State and local communities would receive $12 billion in block
grants, and $8 billion would be earmarked for the Transportation
Department’s highway and road disaster relief. </p>
<p>Nearly $5.7 billion in new funding would go to the Pentagon’s
Virginia-class submarine building by General Dynamics Corp. and
Huntington Ingalls Industries, and about $2.9 billion would go to the
Columbia-class model. </p>
<p>The spending package would include more than $2 billion to help small
businesses bounce back after natural disasters, and approximately $740
million to repair National Aeronautics and Space Administration
facilities after recent hurricanes. </p>
<p>Also tucked into the legislation is a green light for year-round
sales of gasoline with a higher ethanol blend, known as E15, and more
than $13 million for security for U.S. Supreme Court justices at their
residences. </p>
<p>Should lawmakers fail to act in time, federal agencies would enter a
partial shutdown beginning Saturday. </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson leads a narrow and restive 219-211
Republican majority and has repeatedly over the past year had to rely on
Democratic support to pass major legislation. </p>
<p>Representative Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, said in a statement she supported the
“responsible and necessary” spending package. </p>
<p>Rising debt </p>
<p>The stopgap measure is needed because Congress failed to pass its one
dozen annual appropriations bills in time for the current fiscal year,
which began October 1. The government’s “mandatory” programs, which
include Social Security and Medicare retirement and health care benefits
and represent about two-thirds of the budget, renew automatically. </p>
<p>That has contributed to the rising federal debt, which exceeds $36
trillion. Congress will have to address that again early next year, when
a 2023 deal to extend the nation’s debt ceiling expires. Failure could
shock bond markets with potentially severe economic consequences. </p>
<p>Democrats had pushed for a longer bill funding the government through
the end of its current fiscal year ending September 30, but Republicans
wanted to wait for final agreement until after President-elect Donald
Trump is sworn in on January 20 and their party takes its majorities in
both the Senate and the House of Representatives. </p>
<p>Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned all year on a promise
of significantly cutting the number of federal workers and proposing
deep cuts to many of the government’s programs. </p>
<p>Trump has created an advisory committee called the Department of
Government Efficiency, headed by Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world’s
richest person, and former presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek
Ramaswamy. Neither has any government experience. </p>
<p>Riding along in this spending bill is a one-year extension of federal
farm programs, including commodity subsidies and food and nutrition
benefits for low-income people. Without such an extension, prices for
milk, cheese and other dairy products would skyrocket after December
31.</p>

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-propose-bills-to-hit-china-over-fentanyl-trade">US
lawmakers propose bills to hit China over fentanyl trade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday proposed
three bills aimed at cracking down on China’s role in the U.S. fentanyl
crisis, with measures that would set up a U.S. task force to disrupt
narcotics trafficking and pave the way for sanctions on Chinese
entities.</p>
<p>China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican
cartels to produce fentanyl, while Chinese money launderers have become
key players in the international drug trade, U.S. authorities say.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would help hold China’s ruling Communist
Party (CCP) accountable for “directly fueling the fentanyl crisis
through its state subsidies of precursors,” said the House of
Representatives’ Select Committee on China, on which all of the sponsors
of the bills sit.</p>
<p>One bill, The CCP Fentanyl Sanctions Act, introduced by Democratic
Representative Jake Auchincloss, would codify authorities for the U.S.
to cut off Chinese companies from the U.S. banking system, including
vessels, ports and online marketplaces that “knowingly or recklessly”
facilitate shipment of illicit synthetic narcotics.</p>
<p>“This is state-sponsored poisoning of the American people,”
Auchincloss said at an event introducing the legislation. “The genesis
of this is squarely on the mainland of the People’s Republic of
China.”</p>
<p>Two other bills would create a task force of U.S. agencies to conduct
joint operations to disrupt trafficking networks and allow for the
imposition of civil penalties on Chinese entities that fail to properly
manifest or follow formal entry channels when shipping precursors to the
U.S., the committee said.</p>
<p>There is growing consensus in Republican circles close to
President-elect Donald Trump that Beijing has exploited, even
engineered, the synthetic opioid epidemic to harm Americans, something
Beijing denies.</p>
<p>China says it has some of the strictest drug laws in the world, and
that the U.S. needs to curb narcotics demand at home.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a
request for comment on the bills.</p>
<p>With little time remaining in the current congressional term, the
bills would likely need to be reintroduced next year after the new
Congress is sworn in on January 3.</p>
<p>Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the committee, wrote in an
article this month that it was “time to get tough” on Beijing over
fentanyl.</p>

id="trump-sues-des-moines-register-pollster-for-election-interference-after-inaccurate-poll">Trump
sues Des Moines Register, pollster for ‘election interference’ after
inaccurate poll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump sued the Des Moines Register and its
pollster for “brazen election interference” in publishing a survey the
weekend before the election that showed Democrat Kamala Harris with a
surprising lead of 3 percentage points in the state.</p>
<p>The Register’s parent Gannett Co. on Tuesday dismissed the lawsuit as
meritless and said it would vigorously defend its First Amendment
rights.</p>
<p>The lawsuit continues the president-elect’s campaign against media
outlets he feels have wronged him. ABC this past weekend agreed to pay
$15 million toward a Trump presidential library in order to settle a
defamation lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos for inaccurately saying
Trump had been found civilly liable for rape.</p>
<p>The Des Moines survey, done by since-retired pollster J. Ann Selzer,
was considered shocking for indicating that an earlier Trump lead in the
Republican-leaning Midwestern state had been erased. In the actual
election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points.</p>
<p>“There was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a
three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,” the
lawsuit said. “It was election-interfering fiction.”</p>
<p>The poll increased enthusiasm among Democrats, compelled Republicans
to divert campaign time and money to areas in which they were ahead, and
deceived the public into thinking Democrats were doing better than they
actually were, Trump charged.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed late Monday in Polk County district court in
Iowa. It cites Iowa consumer fraud law, and doesn’t ask for specific
monetary damages, but rather wants a trial jury to award triple the
amount of what it determines actual damages to be.</p>
<p>Whatever happens legally, the case could have a chilling effect
beyond Iowa. Trump said in legal papers that he wanted it to deter
“radicals from continuing to act with corrupt intent in releasing polls
manufactured for the purpose of skewing election results in favor of
Democrats.”</p>
<p>Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said the newspaper
acknowledged the pre-election poll did not reflect actual results and
released technical information to explain the data and what went
wrong.</p>
<p>“We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would
be without merit,” she said.</p>
<p>Selzer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on
Tuesday. But she told PBS in Iowa last week that “it’s not my ethic” to
set up a poll to deliver a specific response. She said she was mystified
about what motivation people would think she had.</p>
<p>“To suggest without a single shred of evidence that I was in cahoots
with somebody, I was being paid by somebody, it’s all just kind of, it’s
hard to pay too much attention to it except that they are accusing me of
a crime,” she said.</p>

id="archivist-equal-rights-amendment-cant-be-certified-as-democrats-push-biden-to-recognize-it">Archivist:
Equal Rights Amendment can’t be certified as Democrats push Biden to
recognize it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In a rare joint statement, the archivist and deputy
archivist of the United States said Tuesday that the 1970s-era Equal
Rights Amendment cannot be certified without further action by Congress
or the courts, as Democrats press President Joe Biden to act
unilaterally on its ratification before he leaves office next month.</p>
<p>The five-decade push to amend the Constitution to prohibit
discrimination based on sex remains stalled. Congress sent the
amendment, which guarantees men and women equal rights under the law, to
the states in 1972 and gave states seven years to ratify it, later
extending the deadline to 1982. But the amendment wasn’t ratified by the
required three-quarters of states before the deadline.</p>
<p>Four years ago, however, Virginia lawmakers voted to ratify the
amendment, becoming the 38th and final state needed — albeit nearly four
decades after the congressionally mandated deadline for
ratification.</p>
<p>More than 120 House Democrats, led by Representatives Cori Bush and
Ayanna Pressley, called on Biden on Sunday to direct the archivist to
certify and publish the amendment despite the missed deadline.</p>
<p>“Solidifying your legacy on equal rights with a final action on the
ERA would be a defining moment for the historic Biden-Harris
administration and your presidency,” they wrote to Biden.</p>
<p>But the archivist, Colleen Shogan, and her deputy, William J.
Bosanko, who are responsible for certifying and publishing new
amendments once they meet the required ratification threshold, say
neither they nor Biden can act without Congress or the courts lifting
the deadline.</p>
<p>“In 2020 and again in 2022, the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S.
Department of Justice affirmed that the ratification deadline
established by Congress for the ERA is valid and enforceable,” they said
in a joint statement. “The OLC concluded that extending or removing the
deadline requires new action by Congress or the courts. Court decisions
at both the District and Circuit levels have affirmed that the
ratification deadlines established by Congress for the ERA are
valid.”</p>
<p>They added: “Therefore, the Archivist of the United States cannot
legally publish the Equal Rights Amendment. As the leaders of the
National Archives, we will abide by these legal precedents and support
the constitutional framework in which we operate.”</p>
<p>Congress tried last year in the latest push to lift the deadline to
allow for the amendment’s ratification, but the measure didn’t reach the
required 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p>
<p>Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is leading the effort among Democrats in
the Senate, insisted in a statement that the archivist’s analysis was
flawed and said she was “wrongfully inserting herself into a clear
constitutional process, despite the fact that her role is purely
ministerial.”</p>
<p>She encouraged Biden to ignore the OLC memo and certify the ERA
anyway. “OLC memos are advisory in nature and can easily be disregarded
by the current administration,” she said.</p>
<p>The Biden White House has been discussing the possibility with
lawmakers and in internal meetings, according to a person familiar with
the matter, but believes the best path forward is for Congress to lift
the deadline and thereby eliminate the risk of a legal challenge to the
amendment.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said: “President Biden has been
clear that he wants to see the Equal Rights Amendment definitively
enshrined in the Constitution.”</p>
<p>“Senior administration officials have and will continue to engage
with key Congressional leaders and other stakeholders on this issue in
the weeks ahead,” she added. “It is long past time that we recognize the
clear will of the American people.”</p>

id="suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-charged-with-murder-as-act-of-terrorism">Suspect
in killing of US insurance CEO charged with murder as act of
terrorism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare’s CEO has been
charged with murder as an act of terrorism, prosecutors said Tuesday as
they worked to bring him to a New York court from a Pennsylvania
jail.</p>
<p>Luigi Mangione already was charged with murder in the Dec. 4 killing
of Brian Thompson, but the terror allegation is new.</p>
<p>Under New York law, such a charge can be brought when an alleged
crime is “intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population,
influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or
coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder,
assassination or kidnapping.”</p>
<p>Mangione’s New York lawyer has not commented on the case.</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was shot dead as he walked to a Manhattan hotel where
Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare — the United States’ biggest medical
insurer — was holding an investor conference.</p>
<p>“This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was
intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,” Manhattan
District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at a news conference Tuesday. “It
occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatened the
safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and
businesspeople just starting out on their day.”</p>
<p>After days of intense police searches and publicity, Mangione was
spotted at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and arrested. New York
police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill
Thompson, a passport and various fake IDs, including one that the
suspected shooter presented to check into a New York hostel.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old was charged with Pennsylvania gun and forgery
offenses and locked up there without bail. His Pennsylvania lawyer has
questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal grounding
for the gun charge. The attorney also has said Mangione would fight
extradition to New York.</p>
<p>Mangione has two court hearings scheduled for Thursday in
Pennsylvania, including an extradition hearing, Bragg said.</p>
<p>Hours after his arrest, the Manhattan district attorney’s office
filed paperwork charging him with murder and other offenses. The
indictment builds on that paperwork.</p>
<p>Investigators’ working theory is that Mangione, an Ivy League
computer science grad from a prominent Maryland family, was propelled by
anger at the U.S. health care system. A law enforcement bulletin
obtained by The Associated Press said that when arrested, he was
carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies
“parasitic” and complained about corporate greed.</p>
<p>Mangione repeatedly posted on social media about how spinal surgery
last year had eased his chronic back pain, encouraging people with
similar conditions to speak up for themselves if told they just had to
live with it.</p>
<p>In a Reddit post in late April, he advised someone with a back
problem to seek additional opinions from surgeons and, if necessary, say
the pain made it impossible to work.</p>
<p>“We live in a capitalist society,” Mangione wrote. “I’ve found that
the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than
you describing unbearable pain and how it’s impacting your quality of
life.”</p>
<p>He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer.</p>
<p>Mangione apparently cut himself off from his family and close friends
in recent months. His family reported him missing to San Francisco
authorities in November.</p>
<p>Thompson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, was trained as an
accountant. A married father of two high-schoolers, he had worked at the
giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance
arm in 2021.</p>
<p>His killing kindled a fiery outpouring of resentment toward U.S.
health insurance companies, as Americans swapped stories online and
elsewhere of being denied coverage, left in limbo as doctors and
insurers disagreed, and stuck with sizeable bills.</p>

id="voa-interview-us-urges-europe-to-end-energy-dependency-on-russia">VOA
interview: US urges Europe to end energy dependency on Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden plans in its
final weeks to “continue tightening the noose” around Russia’s key
energy exports with new sanctions to deprive Moscow of revenue for its
war on Ukraine, according to Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey
Pyatt. </p>
<p>Pyatt over the past two weeks has traveled in Europe and Asia to
discuss energy security with allies and the G7+Ukraine energy resilience
group. </p>
<p>In an interview with VOA Ukrainian’s Oksana Bedratenko, Pyatt said
Europe should use the Dec. 31 expiration of a gas transit contract
between Ukraine and Russia to decisively end its dependency on Russian
energy. </p>
<p>He said he is encouraged that Europe sees American liquid natural gas
(LNG) as part of its energy solution, noting that countries in Europe
and even Japan — which imports 10% of its gas from Russia — understand
the need to find alternative energy suppliers. </p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. </p>
<p>VOA: Over recent weeks Russia staged several massive attacks on the
Ukrainian energy sector. With all of the preparations, with all of the
help from Ukraine’s allies before winter, what is your assessment of
Ukrainian energy sector resilience?  </p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey Pyatt: We knew coming into this
winter that this was going to be a very fragile period, but I think the
good news is support for Ukraine, support for Ukrainian energy workers,
is as strong as it’s ever been. We saw another brutal attack on Friday,
especially in western Ukraine, in Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk. … And
this is the bitterest part of the winter. So we know we need to continue
to work together. I’ve just returned from two weeks of travel. I was in
Tokyo and before that I was in Paris and London. The message I heard
consistently from all of our G7 partners was a very clear focus on doing
everything we can to help ensure that Russia’s attempt to weaponize the
winter is a failure.   </p>
<p>VOA: The gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine expires at
the end of this year. Do you think Europe is ready for it? There has
already been some pressure on Ukraine to continue the gas transit. Do
you think this will actually be the end of Europe’s dependency on
Russian gas?  </p>
<p>Pyatt: I certainly hope so. And importantly, the pressure that I see
is only coming from one or two countries. I was very glad to see the
statements over the weekend from the new [EU] Energy Commissioner [Dan]
Jorgensen making very clear the need to make progress on gas phaseout,
on nuclear, on all forms of dependency on Russian energy, in line with
the EU goal of getting to zero by 2027. Obviously, Brussels and Kyiv
need to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks. But I think
long-term it is very clear that the energy and gas trade in particular
has been the principal vector of Russian influence on the Ukrainian
economy since independence. So why on earth would anybody be interested
in extending that relationship?   </p>
<p>VOA:  Europe has been buying more LNG from Russia. Are there any
plans to have more sanctions on Russian LNG projects? </p>
<p>Pyatt: We welcome Europe’s steps. Just today [Dec. 15], the 15th
sanctions package, which is quite substantial. I have said publicly on a
couple of occasions recently that there will be more coming from the
Biden administration. I’m very confident of that. And we’re working very
hard to maintain alignment between Washington, Brussels, London. That’s
part of what I was doing in Europe two weeks ago. Everybody’s pace of
operations is slightly different. … I was glad to see Commissioner
Jorgensen also talk about the important role of American LNG as part of
Europe’s energy solution. So, I’m very confident that we are going to
continue to tighten the noose. We’re going to do everything that we can
to drive down [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s energy revenues,
which go to pay for the North Korean missiles and the Russian drones
that are destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure every day of the
week. </p>
<p>VOA: When we look into the next year, the U.S. support for Ukraine
might go down. Do you think that Europe and other allies are ready to
step up and continue supporting Ukrainian energy? </p>
<p>Pyatt: Everybody is already stepping up. As I think you saw Secretary
[of State Antony] Blinken just signed with [Ukrainian] Foreign Minister
[Andrii] Sybiha a second energy [Memorandum of Understanding]. This is
for the implementation of $825 million in additional energy sector
assistance just from the United States. … That very high level of U.S.
assistance is exceeded by the assistance that has come from the other
G7-plus partners. This is a really important point that it’s not just
the United States that’s providing this assistance, and in fact, the
majority of assistance in the energy sector has come from the other
G7-plus countries.  </p>
<p>VOA: In the MOU there’s a lot of attention going to the protection of
Ukrainian companies from political influence. How important are reforms
in Ukraine even during the war? </p>
<p>Pyatt: Well, as you know, I’ve been working on these reform issues
for 10 years now. So I can appreciate the progress that has been
achieved, and that progress is real. Look for instance at the improved
production numbers at Naftogaz. Maybe that improved production is
because of better management; maybe it’s because production that was
previously skimmed off is now being declared transparently. But either
way, it’s a positive outcome. There’s more that needs to be done. …
Ukraine will not become a member of the European Union in one day, but I
think fulfilling the aspirations that the Ukrainian people expressed
during the revolution of dignity, when I was ambassador in Kyiv, is as
important today as it’s ever been, and aligning Ukraine’s energy sector
with the highest European and OECD (Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development) standards is very much part and parcel of
that larger process of becoming a member of the EU.</p>

World’s First Commercial Fusion Plant Will Be in Virginia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM1ODU5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzQ2NjEyMn0.Xzh976mS-1h-2r1kOCO0jg21Ha4piy17QZDRDzLm2Eo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the buzziest and most well-funded company
in the increasingly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"><u>buzzy
and well-funded fusion sector</u></a>, announced today that it will
build a commercial fusion power plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia —
a first for both the company and the world. CFS will independently
finance, build, own, and operate the 400-megawatt plant, which will
produce enough energy to power about 150,000 homes sometime “in the
early 2030s.”
</p>
<p>
All this will happen in collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia,
which serves electricity to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses.
While Dominion isn’t contributing monetarily, it is providing CFS with
the leasing rights for the proposed site, which it owns, as well as
development and technical expertise. The plant itself will cost billions
to develop and build.
</p>
<p>
“While a utility partnership is not a requirement for this type of
project, we ultimately see utilities playing a critical role as key
customers and future owners of fusion power plants,” a CFS spokesperson
told me via email. “Collaborating and sharing expertise allows CFS to
accelerate its development efforts while equipping Dominion with
valuable insights to inform future commercial decisions and strategies.”
</p>
<p>
The company told me that after a global search, the decision to site the
plant in Virginia came down to factors such as access to infrastructure,
site readiness, the local workforce, potential partnerships, state
support for the clean energy transition, and customer interest. Virginia
is also the world’s biggest market for data centers,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_self"><u>a
booming industry</u></a> in dire need of clean, firm energy to power it
given the growing energy demands of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/google-exxon-gas" target="_self"><u>artificial
intelligence</u></a>. The spokesperson wrote, however, that data center
power demand was “only a part of the decision criteria for CFS.”
</p>
<p>
Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised over $2 billion in funding to
date, including a historically huge $1.8 billion Series B in 2021, which
cemented the company as the industry leader in the race to commercialize
fusion. The spokesperson told me that construction of the grid-connected
commercial plant, known as ARC (an acronym for “affordable, robust,
compact”), isn’t expected to begin until the “late 2020s,” once the
necessary permits are in place. Prior to building and operating ARC, CFS
will demonstrate the technology’s potential via a smaller, noncommercial
pilot plant known as SPARC (“smallest possible ARC”), which is scheduled
to be turned on in 2026 and to produce more energy than it consumes,
a.k.a. demonstrate net energy gain, in 2027. (SPARC will be built at the
company’s headquarters outside Boston, Massachusetts.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, producing electricity from a first-of-its-kind fusion plant
will not come cheap, though the company assured me that Virginia
customers will not see this higher price reflected in their utility
bills. That’s because while CFS plans to sell the electricity ARC
generates into the wholesale energy market, the company is also in
discussions with large corporate buyers interested in procuring the
environmental benefits of this clean energy via long-term, virtual power
purchase agreements. That means that while these potential customers
wouldn’t receive the literal fusion electrons themselves, they would
earn renewable energy credits by essentially covering the cost of the
more expensive fusion power. “The intention is that these customers will
pay for the power such that other Virginia customers will not be
impacted,” the spokesperson told me.
</p>
<p>
CFS claims that when the time comes, connecting a fusion power plant to
the grid should be relatively straightforward. “From the perspective of
grid operators, it will operate similarly to natural gas power plants
already integrated into the grid today,” the spokesperson wrote. That
sets fusion apart from other clean energy sources such as solar and
wind, which often languish in seemingly endless interconnection queues
as they await the buildout of expensive and contentious transmission
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, CFS is not the only player in the increasingly crowded fusion
space
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717332/microsoft-nuclear-fusion-power-plant-helion-purchase-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aiming
to commercialize</u></a> as soon as possible. If fusion is to play a
significant role in the future energy mix, as many experts think it
will, there will almost certainly be multiple companies with a variety
of technical approaches getting grid-connected. But there’s got to be a
first. As Ally Yost, senior vice president of corporate development at
CFS, put it to me when I interviewed her this summer, “One of the things
that’s most exciting about working here and working in this space is
that we are simultaneously building an industry while building a
company.”

<h2 id="the-long-awaited-lng-study-is-out">The Long-Awaited LNG Study Is
Out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI0MzgxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTgxMzc2MX0.AJYDfuf_JIY-cUaHawgmDqYSVGPFoNnzFTd5T976xeE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Department of Energy on Tuesday published the results of its
long-awaited analysis of the economic and environmental implications of
expanding U.S. exports of liquified natural gas. The study was the
culmination of a year-long process after President Biden paused
approvals of new LNG export terminals in January so that the agency
could update the underlying assumptions it uses to determine whether new
facilities are in the “public interest.”
</p>
<p>
Though the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/LNGUpdate_SummaryReport_Dec2024_12pm.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resulting
assessment</u></a> stops short of advising against approving new
projects, it finds that additional U.S. LNG export terminals beyond what
has already been approved would likely raise natural gas prices for U.S.
consumers and increase global greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
The main takeaway, according to an accompanying letter penned by the
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, is that “a business-as-usual
approach is neither sustainable nor advisable.”
</p>
<p>
Among its other key findings:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
LNG projects that have already been approved are likely to produce more
than enough natural gas to meet global demand. New facilities that are
under construction will nearly double exports by 2030, and exports could
double again after that if all the facilities that have been approved,
but have not yet reached a final investment decision, end up getting
built.
</li>
<li>
Supporting that is the fact that demand for U.S. LNG has flattened in
Europe and peaked in Japan, while South Korea’s demand is expected to
plateau by 2030. The DOE’s analysis projects that China will be the
largest LNG importer through 2050, and notes that entities there have
already signed contracts with U.S. LNG export projects.
</li>
<li>
While new LNG terminals will create jobs and revenues, increased exports
could also raise wholesale domestic natural gas prices by more than 30%
by 2050.
</li>
<li>
In all five scenarios the DOE studied, U.S. LNG exports would increase
global net emissions.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Environmental groups celebrated the outcome. “DOE’s analysis confirms
the facts we’ve known for years,” Moneen Nasmith, a senior attorney at
Earthjustice said in a statement. “Rampant LNG exports drive up energy
prices, contribute to the catastrophic effects of climate change, and
delay the global transition to truly clean energy.”
</p>
<p>
But the gas industry was quick to criticize the findings. In a
statement, Karen Harbert, the president and CEO of the American Gas
Association, accused the Biden administration of attempting to “justify”
the president’s earlier pause on approvals. “The contribution of U.S.
natural gas to driving down emissions in this country and the potential
for lowering global emissions is unquestioned,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The transition from coal-fired power plants to natural gas was a major
driver of emission reductions in the United States over the last decade.
But renewable energy is increasingly a competitive alternative. An
analysis of the climate impacts from expanding LNG exports must look not
just at whether the fuel would displace dirtier options like coal and
Russian natural gas, but also at whether it would displace cleaner
options like renewables. The answer depends on which countries end up
buying it, and how their climate commitments evolve.
</p>
<p>
As such, any estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from LNG exports is
based on assumptions. Under the Department of Energy’s “defined
policies” scenario, it found that additional U.S. LNG exports could end
up displacing more renewable energy in other countries than coal,
without even factoring in countries’ stated commitments to decarbonize.
Overall in this scenario, additional exports would lead to an increase
of 711 million metric tons of carbon dioxide between now and 2050.
</p>
<p>
The rapid acceleration of U.S. LNG exports has not had a discernible
effect on U.S. natural gas prices to date. But the Department of Energy
finds that “unfettered” LNG exports in the future would put upward
pressure on domestic natural gas prices and potentially increase energy
costs for U.S. consumers by more than $100 per year by 2050.
</p>
<p>
Biden’s pause on new LNG approvals was technically overturned in July,
when a federal judge found that the administration had overstepped its
authority. But two major projects still hang in the balance, the
Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG Terminal and the Commonwealth LNG Terminal, both of
which would be built in coastal Louisiana. Both projects
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/following-ferc-notices-us-department-energy-provides-clarity-status-lng-export" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>require
approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</u></a> before
the Department of Energy can issue a public interest determination.
</p>
<p>
Although the report published Tuesday is “final,” the administration is
opening it up for public comment for 60 days, starting today, to ensure
that alternative analyses are captured in the public record and can
inform decisionmaking going forward.
</p>
<p>
In that, the gas industry sees an opening. “We look forward to working
with the incoming administration to rectify the glaring issues with this
study during the public comment period,” Harbert said in her statement.
</p>
<p>
During the call on Tuesday, Granholm acknowledged that the future is in
the next administration’s hands. “We hope that they’ll take these facts
into account to determine whether additional LNG exports are truly in
the best interest of the American people and economy,” she said.
</p>

information from the finished report as well as the DOE’s Tuesday call

consultant found guilty in San Francisco stabbing death of Cash App
founder</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A San Francisco jury on Tuesday found a
tech consultant guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of
Cash App founder Bob Lee, which carries a sentence of 16 years to
life.</p>
<p>Jurors took seven days to deliver their verdict against Nima Momeni
in the April 4, 2023, death of Lee, a beloved tech mogul who was found
staggering on a deserted downtown street, dripping a trail of blood and
calling for help. Lee, 43, later died at a hospital.</p>
<p>“We think justice was done here today,” the victim’s brother, Tim
Oliver Lee, told reporters. “What matters today is that we had a guilty
verdict and Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an
isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times with a
knife he took from his sister’s kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with
Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave
her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked
him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about
spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club
that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and
said he didn’t realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even
hurt.</p>
<p>The case has drawn national attention, partly given Lee’s status in
the tech world.</p>
<p>Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023, when
he was charged with murder in the first degree. Jurors received the
case, which started Oct. 14, on Dec. 4.</p>
<p>Lee had created mobile payment service Cash App and was the chief
product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin when he died. He had
moved to Miami from the San Francisco Bay Area, where his ex-wife Krista
Lee lives with their two children.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two
people and one entity based in the United Arab Emirates, accusing them
of being involved in a network that launders millions of dollars
generated by IT workers and cybercrimes to support the North Korean
government. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the two people
hit with sanctions worked through a UAE-based front company to
facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion services that
funneled the illicit proceeds back to Pyongyang. </p>
<p>North Korea’s mission to the United Nations didn’t immediately return
a message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s action comes as Washington seeks to cut off funding for
North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile
programs, the Treasury said.  </p>
<p>“As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its
WMD and ballistic missile programs — including through the exploitation
of digital assets — Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks
that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime,” Treasury Acting Under
Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in
the statement. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s move targeted UAE-based Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and
Zhang Jian as well as UAE-based Green Alpine Trading LLC. It freezes any
of their U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with
them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk
being hit with sanctions. </p>
<p>The Emirati embassy in Washington didn’t immediately return a message
seeking comment. Reuters could not immediately locate contact details
for Green Alpine Trading, Lu or Zhang.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-put-solar-panels-on-evs">Why Not Put Solar Panels on
EVs?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM1ODMxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzUyNTkzNX0.GkxFLKZxjX5xgjjHKOV28pEuCbDdIz2zl7f0a-hlYvk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Here’s something to chew on over the holiday break: The top of a car is
wasted space. Sure, you can put a sunroof there to let in a little light
and breeze or install a roof rack to take your surfboard to the beach.
But for the most part, the roof is just a field of metal to keep the
elements out of the cabin.
</p>
<p>
In an electric vehicle, that square footage could have a job. What if
solar panels embedded in the roof generated juice to recharge the
battery as the car flies down the highway or sits in the middle of a
parking lot, blasted by the summertime sun? It’s an idea that’s starting
to get more traction. It’s about time.
</p>
<p>
The idea of a car slathered in solar panels is well-worn territory. For
decades, engineers have staged solar car races such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Solar_Challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>World
Solar Challenge</u></a>, contested by vehicles running solely on sun
power. It takes a lot of real estate to generate enough solar energy to
move something as heavy as a car, though. That is why solar challenge
competitors are often stripped-down, super-lightweight pods.
</p>
<p>
The question for a commercial car is, can embedded solar produce enough
energy to make it worth the trouble and expense? A few, like the
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2023-lightyear-one-first-look-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lightyear
One</u></a> concept vehicle, have dared to try.
<a href="https://invest.aptera.us/?utm_campaign=AMM_2024&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=search_investment&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP-6BhDyARIsAJ3uv7bwYmWJ0tnJHB4LUMWzrBOlCCFkxBP3Hk7lqUg0GTguhcH_fjFMIPEaAqoKEALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Aptera</u></a>
keeps trying to sell the solar car. Among real production EVs, the
doomed Fisker Ocean offered a solar roof on its most expensive version.
Toyota’s Prius Prime plug-in hybrid offers a solar roof as an add-on. In
some places around the world, the popular Hyundai Ioniq 5 comes with
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/electric-cars-with-solar-panels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enough</u></a>
solar capability to add 3 miles of range per day.
</p>
<p>
EV solar hasn’t caught on in the mainstream, however. The world’s top EV
maker, Tesla, has long been standoffish about the idea. When CEO Elon
Musk is asked about EVs with solar,
<a href="https://www.slashgear.com/1435368/elon-musk-explains-electric-car-solar-panels/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
he was</u></a> on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2023, he typically
dismisses the idea. After Rogan pressed him, Musk estimated that a
square meter of PV would be exposed to just 1 kilowatt of energy and
could probably only harvest 25% of that, a tiny contribution that’s
nowhere near what you’d need to push a Tesla down the road. (Modern DC
fast-chargers discharge energy in the hundreds of kilowatts.)
</p>
<p>
In other words, what solar panels on a car could harvest amounts to a
drop in the bucket. But if you leave out enough buckets for long enough,
those drops eventually add up to something. For example: At the same
time he was pooh-poohing car solar, Musk acknowledged the promise of a
kind of fold-out system, something that unfurled like a satellite to
expose a large surface area of PV. Imagine those

<p>
Los Angeles-based
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744228/dartsolar-ev-solar-panels-range/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DartSolar</u></a>
is trying to sell just that. The startup has begun offering a package of
solar panels that can sit on the roof of an EV just like that big Thule
roof box riding on the top racks of so many Subarus. When closed, just
two of the six available solar panels are exposed, gathering up to 320
watts of energy as the car drives or sits in an outdoor parking stall.
Find yourself at a campground, the beach, or anywhere else there’s room
for the package to expand, then all six panels can start generating
electricity at a maximum of 960 watts, or nearly a kilowatt.
</p>
<p>
The company claims that you could add 10 to 20 miles of driving range
per day this way, which is nothing to sneeze at. It’s like a green range
extender that just lives on top of your car and, at 87 pounds, doesn’t
weigh so much that it’s killing your mileage. But it’s not exactly
cheap: DartSolar says the package will ultimately cost around $3,500,
meaning it would take quite a while to recoup the upfront from free
solar energy, even if the system does qualify for some incentives.
</p>
<p>
Another startup,
<a href="https://gosun.co/pages/ev-solar-charger?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21397996718&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP-6BhDyARIsAJ3uv7Y7do1t-r3kvUiRpJSPCiRTr65XWUrt8fbdVGVqmNbyyiUZYTByq0caAr22EALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GoSun</u></a>,
offers a slightly different take on the same idea. Instead of expanding
into a flat plane of PV, its panels cascade from the roof down the front
and back to gather up to 30 miles of range per day. GoSun promises to
deliver in 2025 for about $3,000.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the smartest way to power your EV with solar is to put PV on
the roof of your home, a place with much fewer square footage and weight
constraints than the surface of a vehicle. But as solar continues to get
more efficient, it will make less and less sense to ignore the real
estate on a car. After all, every watt of extra energy from the sun is
one you don’t have to get somewhere else.

woman doing well after latest experimental pig kidney transplant</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney
transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the
latest effort to save human lives with animal organs. </p>
<p>Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ —
and notably, she isn’t as sick as prior recipients who died within two
months of receiving a pig kidney or heart. </p>
<p>“It’s like a new beginning,” Looney, 53, told The Associated Press.
Right away, “the energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney —
and to feel it — is unbelievable.” </p>
<p>Looney’s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for
formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said
Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly
experimental procedure. </p>
<p>Looney is recuperating well after her transplant, which was announced
Tuesday. She was discharged from the hospital 11 days after surgery to
continue recovery in a nearby apartment although temporarily readmitted
this week while her medications are adjusted. Doctors expect her to
return home to Alabama in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail,
she could begin dialysis again. </p>
<p>“To see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,” said
Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney’s original surgeon who secured Food and Drug
Administration permission for the Nov. 25 transplant. </p>
<p>More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who
need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant
never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are
genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike. </p>
<p>Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later a complication
during pregnancy caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining
kidney, which eventually failed. It’s incredibly rare for living donors
to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority
on the transplant list. </p>
<p>But Looney couldn’t get a match — she had developed antibodies
abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she’d
reject every kidney donors have offered. </p>
<p>Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant
surgeon, she’d like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA
application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like
Looney who are out of options. </p>
<p>The FDA didn’t agree right away. Instead, the world’s first
gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last
spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious
heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a
month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to
the pig kidney. NYU’s patient had heart complications that damaged her
pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died. </p>
<p>Those disappointing outcomes didn’t dissuade Looney, who was starting
to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn’t developed heart
disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her
transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery. </p>
<p>Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told
the AP: “You don’t know if it’s going to work or not until you
try.” </p>
<p>Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney’s new kidney
from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Moments after Montgomery sewed it
into place, the kidney turned a healthy pink and began producing
urine. </p>
<p>Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track
her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning
to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission.
Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to
prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early
warning if problems crop up. </p>
<p>“A lot of what we’re seeing, we’re seeing for the first time,”
Montgomery said. </p>
<p>During a visit last week with Locke, who now works for the federal
government, Looney hugged her longtime doctor, saying, “Thank you for
not giving up on me.” </p>
<p>“Never,” Locke responded.</p>

<li>What to expect from the looming LNG report

<p>
The Department of Energy’s study on liquefied natural gas exports could
drop as soon as today, but we might already know what’s in it thanks to
an accompanying letter written by Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and

by <em>The New York Times</em>. The key takeaways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Continued U.S. LNG exports at recent levels would have negative impacts
on both the economy and the environment.
</li>
<li>
“Unfettered exports” would drive up wholesale domestic gas prices by
30%, hurting consumers and industry alike.
</li>
<li>
Increasing exports could generate 1.5 gigatons of direct

id="us-hits-north-korea-and-russia-with-new-sanctions-treasury-says">US
hits North Korea and Russia with new sanctions, Treasury says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States hit North Korea and Russia on Monday
with new sanctions targeting Pyongyang’s financial and military support
to Moscow as well as its ballistic missile program.</p>
<p>The sanctions, which list North Korean banks, generals and other
officials, as well as Russian oil shipping companies, are the latest
U.S. measure aimed at disrupting North Korea’s support to Russia’s war
in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The North Korean banks targeted include Golden Triangle Bank, one of
the biggest banks in the northeastern Rason Special Economic Zone, and
Pyongyang-based Korea Mandal Credit Bank, which has representatives
throughout China, the Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>South Korea’s foreign ministry separately said on Tuesday that it has
blacklisted 11 individuals and 15 entities linked to illicit military
cooperation between North Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>The responses came as 10 countries, including the U.S., South Korea,
Australia, Britain, France and Japan, as well as the European Union,
issued a joint statement on Tuesday condemning Pyongyang and Moscow’s
military ties “in the strongest possible terms.”</p>
<p>The statement said North Korea’s support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine was a “dangerous expansion of the conflict” and a “flagrant
violation” of United Nations’ sanctions. It urged the country to
withdraw its troops from Russia.</p>
<p>Pyongyang and Moscow have ramped up diplomatic and economic ties in
recent years, culminating in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to
North Korea in June when the countries’ leaders agreed a mutual defense
pact.</p>
<p>Military cooperation between the two countries has been met by
international alarm, with Washington, Kyiv and Seoul condemning North
Korea for sending military equipment and more than 10,000 troops to
support Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February
2022.</p>
<p>North Korea’s actions, including its most recent test of a long-range
ballistic missile and its deepening military support to Russia,
undermine the stability of the region and sustain Putin’s war in
Ukraine, said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury
for terrorism and financial intelligence.</p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to disrupting the illicit
procurement and facilitation networks that enable these destabilizing
activities,” he said.</p>
<p>The officials sanctioned by both Washington and Seoul include North
Korean generals leading tens of thousands of North Korean troops in
Russia, including Kim Yong Bok, who has appeared at seven events with
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, including special forces
exercises.</p>
<p>South Korea separately blacklisted the North’s special forces unit
known as the Storm Corps, also in Russia fighting against Ukraine, and
its chief, Ri Pong Chun.</p>
<p>Ukraine said on Monday that at least 30 North Korean soldiers had
been killed or injured in combat in Russia’s Kursk region over the
weekend.</p>
<p>It said that Moscow began deploying them in the southern region in
significant numbers last week to conduct assaults on Ukrainian
forces.</p>
<p>Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August.</p>
<p>Kyiv estimates there are 11,000 North Koreans in total, adding to a
force of tens of thousands of Russians.</p>
<p>Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Koreans
on its side.</p>
<p>Oil and gas to the North </p>
<p>The Treasury sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of the designated
entities, ban their trade with Americans, and block them from
transactions with the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>The Treasury blacklisted Russia-based foreign trade companies that it
said were shipping oil and gas to North Korea. The companies include
Vostok Trading, DV Ink, and Novosibirskoblgaz. Treasury said they began
shipping “thousands of tons of oil and gas” to North Korea beginning in
2022 and continuing through at least April 2024.</p>
<p>North Korea has likely received more than 1 million barrels of oil
from Russia over an eight-month period this year in breach of U.N.
sanctions, according to an analysis of satellite imagery published in
November by the British-based Open Source Centre and the BBC.</p>
<p>North Korean oil tankers have made more than 40 visits to Russia’s
Far Eastern port of Vostochny since March, the report on the research
group Open Source Centre’s website said.</p>
<p>The sanctions also targeted Sibregiongaz, AO, the Russia-based parent
company and 100% owner of Novosibirskoblgaz. They also hit Okryu Trading
Company, or Okryu, a North Korea-based foreign trade company that
Treasury said has received thousands of tons of oil shipments from
Russia.</p>

id="judge-rejects-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-hush-money-conviction-because-of-supreme-court-immunity-ruling">Judge
rejects Trump’s bid to dismiss hush money conviction because of Supreme
Court immunity ruling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A judge Monday rejected President-elect Donald Trump’s bid
to have his hush money conviction dismissed because of the U.S. Supreme
Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity. But the case’s overall
future remains unclear.</p>
<p>Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan’s decision eliminates one potential
off-ramp from the case ahead of Trump’s return to office next month. His
lawyers have raised other arguments for dismissal, however.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said there should be some accommodation for his
upcoming presidency, but they insist the conviction should stand.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>A jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business
records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy
Daniels in 2016. Trump denies wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The allegations involved a scheme to hide the payout to Daniels
during the final days of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to keep her
from publicizing — and keep voters from hearing — her claim of a sexual
encounter with the married then-businessman years earlier. He says
nothing sexual happened between them.</p>
<p>A month after the verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that ex-presidents
can’t be prosecuted for official acts — things they did in the course of
running the country — and that prosecutors can’t cite those actions to
bolster a case centered on purely personal, unofficial conduct.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers then cited the Supreme Court opinion to argue that
the hush money jury got some improper evidence, such as Trump’s
presidential financial disclosure form, testimony from some White House
aides and social media posts made while he was in office.</p>
<p>In Monday’s ruling, Merchan denied the bulk of Trump’s claims that
some of prosecutors’ evidence related to official acts and implicated
immunity protections.</p>
<p>The judge said that even if he found that some evidence related to
official conduct, he’d still find that prosecutors’ decision to use
“these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying
business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and
function of the Executive Branch.”</p>
<p>Even if prosecutors had erroneously introduced evidence that could be
challenged under an immunity claim, Merchan continued, “such error was
harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors had said the evidence in question was only “a sliver” of
their case.</p>
<p>Trump communications director Steven Cheung on Monday called
Merchan’s decision a “direct violation of the Supreme Court’s decision
on immunity, and other longstanding jurisprudence.”</p>
<p>“This lawless case should have never been brought, and the
Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,” Cheung said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case,
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Trump takes office January 20.</p>

<h2 id="trump-softbank-ceo-announce-100-billion-investment-in-us">Trump,
SoftBank CEO announce $100 billion investment in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a joint appearance Monday morning, President-elect Donald Trump
and Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of the Japanese technology
conglomerate SoftBank Group, announced that the company would invest
$100 billion in U.S. companies over the coming four years, saying that
the infusion of cash would create 100,000 jobs in fields such as
artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Son attributed the decision to make the investment directly to
Trump’s win in last month’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President
Trump,” Son said. “My confidence level [in] the economy of the United
States has tremendously increased with his victory. So, because of that,
I’m now excited to commit this 100 billion dollars and 100,000 jobs into
the United States.”</p>
<p>In introducing Son, Trump pointed out that eight years ago, after
Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, SoftBank had made a similar
pledge, promising $50 billion in U.S. investments and 50,000 new
jobs.</p>
<p>“And they did,” Trump said. “They kept that promise in every way,
shape and form.”</p>
<p>The president-elect then went on to press Son to double his pledge,
saying “I’m going to ask him right now. Would you make it $200
billion?”</p>
<p>Son reiterated his promise of $100 billion, but said he would “try”
to get to $200 billion.</p>
<p>“All right. $200 billion,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Son burst into laughter, telling the crowd Trump is “a great
negotiator.”</p>
<p>‘Trump effect’</p>
<p>After the announcement Monday, Trump’s rapid response director, Jake
Schneider, sent media outlets an email attributing the announcement to
what he called the “Trump Effect.”</p>
<p>“President Trump is already delivering on his commitment to re-make
America into the world’s manufacturing superpower once again — and he
hasn’t even taken office yet,” Schneider wrote. “It’s all centered
around his Made in America agenda, which incentivizes companies that
make their products in America with American workers.”</p>
<p>He added, “In January, President Trump will immediately begin
implementing bold reforms to restore the nation to full prosperity and
make sure AI, emerging technologies, and the other industries of
tomorrow are created, built, and grown in the United States.”</p>
<p>Hits and misses</p>
<p>Since founding SoftBank in 1981 at age 24, Son has become one of the
most storied — and controversial — technology investors in the world.
The company has several investment funds and owns significant shares of
hundreds of companies across multiple fields, including
telecommunication, robotics, internet services, e-commerce, artificial
intelligence and much more.</p>
<p>Throughout his decades-long career, Son has made headlines for
spectacular victories as well as disastrous failures. For a time, at the
beginning of 2000, he claimed to be the world’s richest man, with a
fortune worth an estimated $78 billion amassed by buying up internet
startups. However, the collapse of the dotcom bubble just months later
wiped out more than 90% of his wealth.</p>
<p>Son started rebuilding his business that same year, and a $20 million
investment that bought SoftBank a 34% ownership share in a little-known
Chinese e-commerce startup known as Alibaba would prove key to his
fortunes. In 2014, Alibaba went public at a price that valued SoftBank’s
shares at $58 billion, some 2,900 times its initial investment.</p>
<p>Along the way, Son successfully managed to merge mobile
telecommunications firms T-Mobile and Sprint, creating one of the
largest U.S. service providers in 2020. Just two years later, though,
SoftBank suffered disastrous losses with the collapse of the
office-sharing startup WeWork, in which it had invested heavily, as well
as other failed investments by in-house venture and hedge funds.</p>
<p>At the time, Son announced that he was retiring from public life.
However, by 2023, he was back in the headlines when ARM Holdings, a
British computer chip design firm that SoftBank bought at a valuation of
$30.8 billion in 2016, went public in the U.S. at a valuation of $54.5
billion.</p>
<p>Choosing the West over China</p>
<p>Lionel Barber, the former editor-in-chief of the Financial Times,
told VOA that he believes Son’s appearance at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort
Monday signals more than just an international investor seeking to get
on the good side of an incoming U.S. president.</p>
<p>Barber is the author of Gambling Man: The Wild Ride of Masayoshi Son,
the first biography of the investor by a Western author, which will be
published in the U.S. next month. He said that when Son made his pledge
of $50 billion in 2016, he and Trump had clearly aligned interests.</p>
<p>“Trump wanted a big signal about business confidence in the Trump
agenda and Masayoshi Son and SoftBank wanted to get in with the new
Republican administration with an eye to getting [a] blessing for his
big project, which was Sprint merging with T-Mobile,” Barber told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Now, though, he sees something larger at play.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the world looks very different. Eight years on, we’ve got
wars around the world, and we’ve also got de-risking and decoupling
between China and the West,” Barber said.</p>
<p>In his last interview with him, Barber told VOA, Son said that he had
realized that it was necessary for SoftBank to make a choice between
China and the West.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Son, Barber said, “He basically said, ‘We understand the
world’s changed. We’ve been a global investor. We’ve been the biggest
investor in China and the biggest investor in America. But now we have
to choose. We’ve chosen the West.’”</p>
<p>“So, I see his getting into Mar-a-Lago as [saying], ‘I’ve chosen the
West. I’ve chosen America, and I’m going with Trump.’”</p>
<p>Investment details unclear</p>
<p>The announcement at Mar-a-Lago did not include any details about
specific investments that SoftBank intends to make, and not all foreign
investments touted by Trump over the years have come to pass.</p>
<p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2017 promised a $10
billion investment in a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin that was
later dramatically scaled back.</p>
<p>Even SoftBank’s 2016 pledge is difficult to consider truly fulfilled
unless the more than $20 billion the company poured into Sprint in 2013
— three years before making the pledge — is included in the total.</p>
<p>Barber, Son’s biographer, said he has some doubts about SoftBank’s
ability to identify $100 billion in U.S. investments over the course of
four years.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I haven’t figured out how he
gets to 100 billion, yet,” Barber said.</p>
<p>However, he said, it’s also important not to underestimate Son’s
ability to achieve unexpected successes.</p>
<p>“You can’t write him off,” Barber said. “That’s what he does. He’s a
bloody genius in that respect.”</p>

id="tices-mother-asks-netanyahu-to-pause-syria-strikes-to-locate-journalist">Tice’s
mother asks Netanyahu to pause Syria strikes to locate journalist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who has
been detained in Syria for more than 12 years, reiterated her call
Monday for the Israeli military to pause strikes in a part of Syria
where her son may be held.  </p>
<p>“I think it would be polite, to say the least, that perhaps they’re
not bombing while people are trying to clear the prisons,” Debra Tice
told reporters Monday afternoon outside the Syrian Embassy in
Washington.  </p>
<p>That call comes days after she made the same appeal in a letter to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  </p>
<p>In a letter dated Dec. 14, Debra Tice told the Israeli leader her
family has “credible information” that her son may be held in a prison
outside the Syrian capital, Damascus, and urged the Israeli military to
pause strikes in the area to allow rescuers to search the site.  </p>
<p>“We are aware that your military has an active campaign in the area,
preventing rescuers from approaching and accessing the prison facility,”
she wrote in the letter, which The New York Times published Monday. </p>
<p>The Israeli military has been bombing weapons depots and air defenses
in Syria. Israel says it wants to keep military equipment away from
extremists.  </p>
<p>In the letter, Debra Tice said her son may be held in a prison under
a Syrian military museum in the mountainous Mount Qasioun area. The
prison was connected by a tunnel to a neighborhood and a government
palace, she added in the letter. </p>
<p>“We have no way of knowing if the prisoners there have food and
water. We urgently request you pause strikes on this area and deploy
Israeli assets to search for Austin Tice and other prisoners. Time is of
the essence,” she said. </p>
<p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment. </p>
<p>But Gal Hirsch, the Israeli government’s lead envoy for hostage
affairs, told The Times that he had received the letter and was
coordinating with U.S. officials. </p>
<p>“We will do everything possible in assisting the United States of
America to bring the hostages and missing persons back home,” Hirsch
said. </p>
<p>A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Austin Tice has been held in
Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus.
Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or
seen of him since. </p>
<p>Earlier in December, before the Bashar al-Assad government fell, the
Tice family revealed it had obtained information vetted by the U.S.
government that confirmed Austin Tice was still alive and detained in
the Damascus area.  </p>
<p>Since Syrian rebels, led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham (HTS), took Damascus and toppled Assad’s government on December
8, thousands of prisoners have been released from prisons run by the
now-deposed government.  </p>
<p>The release of those prisoners has raised hope in the Tice family
that Austin will be among them.  </p>
<p>“I feel like we’re standing in line, and we’re not the only ones that
are still standing in line,” Debra Tice told reporters Monday. “It’s
going to take a while.”  </p>
<p>Austin Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer
who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and
McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad. </p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters
Monday that the  </p>
<p>United States has communicated with HTS on the importance of locating
Austin Tice, but that there are no U.S. government personnel on the
ground in Syria looking for the journalist.  </p>
<p>“We have a number of people engaged on trying to find Austin Tice and
bring him home, and we communicated directly to HTS that anything that
they could do to help us find him, we would greatly appreciate,” Miller
said.  </p>
<p>Syria’s transitional government said last week that the search for
Austin Tice is ongoing, and that it would cooperate with the U.S.
government in finding Americans who were disappeared by the former Assad
government.  </p>
<p>Outside the Syrian Embassy in Washington, which the U.S. government
forced to close in 2014 but may now reopen soon, Debra Tice told
reporters she has never lost hope that her son will return home. </p>
<p>“I’ve always had hope. I’ve never had even a millisecond of
hopelessness,” she said. “We just need to get all those prisons opened,
get all those families reunited, including us.”</p>

id="man-sentenced-for-helping-pregnant-chinese-women-in-us-birthing-scheme">Man
sentenced for helping pregnant Chinese women in ‘US birthing
scheme’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — A California man was sentenced Monday to nearly 3½
years in prison for running an extensive business that helped pregnant
Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who would
automatically have American citizenship.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities had sought a more than five-year prison term for
Michael Wei Yueh Liu, 59, who was convicted in September of conspiracy
and money laundering for running a company known as USA Happy Baby.
Phoebe Dong, Liu’s wife — though the couple have since separated — was
also convicted in connection with the scheme and is expected to be
sentenced early next year.</p>
<p>After receiving a 41-month sentence, Liu was led out of the courtroom
by authorities and taken into custody. He gave his attorney his belt and
a folder and held Dong’s hand briefly while she sobbed.</p>
<p>In court, Liu had pleaded for leniency to care for his elderly
parents and 13-year-old son, all of whom depend on him, while about a
dozen supporters, many from his church, attended to provide moral
support. Liu said his family has suffered deeply for nearly a decade
since a 2015 raid on his business.</p>
<p>“My intent was always to uphold the values of integrity and
responsibility, so I regret any actions or decisions that may have
brought us to this moment of judgment,” Liu told the court during his
sentencing hearing. “I have tried my best to remain a source of
stability for my family, but my incarceration will place them in a more
vulnerable position.”</p>
<p>“I am not here to deflect responsibility, but to seek mercy,” he
said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner said defendants’ family members
are often the ones who suffer, but it is the defendant’s actions, not
the court’s, that caused the harm. Nevertheless, Klausner said he was
reducing the sentence due to Liu’s family situation.</p>
<p>“These are choices you make, not that the court makes,” Klausner
said.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities said USA Happy Baby helped several hundred women
travel from China to give birth to U.S.-citizen babies between 2012 and
2015. The tourists paid as much as $40,000 for services including
apartment rentals during their stays in Southern California and worked
with overseas entities that coached women on what to say during visa
interviews and upon arriving in U.S. airports, advising them to wear
loose clothing to hide their pregnancies.</p>
<p>“For tens of thousands of dollars each, [the] defendant helped his
numerous customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for
their children,” federal prosecutors wrote in court papers. “This
criminal conduct is serious and requires a meaningful sentence to
promote respect for the law and hold [the] defendant accountable.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to comment immediately after the sentencing.</p>
<p>Kevin Cole, Liu’s attorney, had asked that his client face no more
than 26 months and requested he be allowed to serve his sentence from
home. On Monday, Cole asked the judge to consider his client’s critical
role as the caretaker for his 95-year-old father and 82-year-old mother,
shuttling them to medical appointments, bathing them and cooking their
food, and his otherwise upstanding life growing up in Taiwan — serving
in its military and attending to his family.</p>
<p>“He’s somebody that has lived an honorable life,” Cole told the
court. “There’d be no benefit to him or the public for an extensive
prison sentence in this case.”</p>
<p>The case against Liu and Dong dates back years. Federal authorities
searched more than a dozen homes across Southern California in a 2015
crackdown on operators of businesses catering to Chinese women seeking
to deliver their babies in the United States and four years later
charged the pair and more than a dozen others, including a woman who
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for running a
company known as You Win USA.</p>
<p>Such businesses have long operated in California and other states and
have catered to people not only from China, but also from Russia,
Nigeria and elsewhere. It isn’t illegal to visit the United States while
pregnant but lying to U.S. consular and immigration officials about the
reasons for travel on government documents is not permitted.</p>
<p>The key draw for travelers has been that the United States has
birthright citizenship, which many believe could help their children
secure a U.S. college education and provide a sort of future insurance
policy — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for
permanent residency once their American child turns 21.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has promised to end birthright
citizenship once in office, but any such effort would face steep legal
hurdles.</p>

<h2 id="us-census-bureau-adding-refugees-to-immigrant-count">US Census
Bureau adding refugees to immigrant count</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts immigrants in annual
estimates by including more people who were admitted for humanitarian,
and often temporary, reasons. </p>
<p>The change is being made in an effort to better reflect population
shifts this decade, officials said Monday. Population estimates,
including immigration, are due to be released Thursday showing how the
populations of the United States and the 50 states changed this year.
However, the new approach to counting immigrants will only be reflected
nationally. </p>
<p>The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign born rose to its
highest level in more than a century in 2023. It could be even higher
under the new methodology. Census Bureau officials wouldn’t say Monday
how much larger they expected the immigration figures to be in
Thursday’s release because of the change. </p>
<p>Capturing the number of new immigrants is the most difficult part of
the annual U.S. population estimates. Although the newly announced
change in methodology is unrelated, the timing comes a month before a
return to the White House of President-elect Donald Trump, who has
promised mass deportations of people in the United States
illegally. </p>
<p>“We feel confident that this was a good approach in order to make our
estimates more current and reflect recent trends that we’ve seen,” said
Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>The bureau’s annual calculation of how many migrants entered the
United States in the 2020s has been much lower than the numbers cited by
other federal agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The
Census Bureau estimated 1.1 million immigrants entered the United States
in 2023, while the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate was 3.3
million people. </p>
<p>The group of people being included in the international migration
estimates are those who enter the country through humanitarian parole,
which has been granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic
presidential administrations to people unable to use standard
immigration routes because of time pressure or their government’s poor
relations with the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, said last week that more than
5.8 million people were admitted under various humanitarian policies
from 2021 to 2024. </p>
<p>Trump appears certain to dismantle humanitarian parole, saying during
his campaign that he would end the “outrageous abuse of parole.” The
annual population estimates released by the Census Bureau each year are
calculated from births, deaths, migration to the United States and
migration between states. The population estimates provide the official
population counts each year between the once-a-decade census for the
United States, the 50 states, counties and metro areas. The figures are
used for distributing trillions of dollars in federal funding.</p>

<h2 id="trump-discusses-drone-sightings-along-us-east-coast">Trump
discusses drone sightings along US East Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump contended Monday that the country’s
military “for some reason” was keeping details secret about unexplained
drones flying across the nighttime skies above the eastern United
States, but the White House later minimized the drone sightings.</p>
<p>“Our military knows … something strange is going on,” Trump told
reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in his first wide-ranging
news conference since his election to a new four-year term in the White
House starting next month.</p>
<p>For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders
New York City, and other states to the north and south along the
Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed
drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated.</p>
<p>They say that most of the alleged unmanned drones are manned
aircraft, and that fewer than 100 of the sightings need to be
investigated further.</p>
<p>All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the
unexplained sightings, including the dispatching of drones by foreign
countries and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership
positioned off U.S. eastern coastal waters.</p>
<p>At the White House, National Security spokesperson John Kirby told
reporters, “Our assessment at this stage is that the activity represents
commercial, hobbyist, law enforcement drones, all operating legally and
lawfully, and/or civilian aviation aircraft.”</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing before Trump’s news conference began, Air
Force Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters
there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings
pose a national security or public safety threat, or have a foreign
nexus.”</p>
<p>Ryder added, “We are sensitive to the fact that there are public
concerns and many questions. … We are also committed to providing as
much information as possible as quickly as possible on this.”</p>
<p>The military has a rationale for not shooting them down, Ryder said,
offering a “loose analogy” to unexplained cars traveling near military
bases.</p>
<p>“On any given day, an unauthorized car or truck may approach one of
the base gates, usually on accident,” Ryder said, and “99% of the time
those cars are turned away without incident.”</p>
<p>“The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,” Ryder said.
“There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis.
It’s not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication
of malicious activity or any public safety threat.”</p>
<p>In recent days, Republican and Democratic officials alike have called
on officials in the administration of President Joe Biden to be more
forthcoming in saying what they know about the drones.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, who is set to
become Trump’s national security adviser when he takes office January
20, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We need to get to the bottom
of it.”</p>
<p>In his hourlong news conference, Trump touched on a wide range of
topics five weeks before assuming power again and becoming the second
president after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s to take over the White
House for a second nonconsecutive term.</p>
<p>He said his reception from world leaders this time is sharply more
favorable than it was in 2017 after his first presidential victory.</p>
<p>“It’s really the opposite of hostile. They’re calling me,” he said.
“I’ve spoken to over 100 countries.”</p>
<p>Trump said he would not end the use of the long-accepted polio
vaccine in the U.S. but questioned the mandates in many U.S. states for
a range of childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>“I’m not really a big mandate guy,” he said, and asked rhetorically,
“Why is the autism rate so high” in the United States, although any link
between autism and vaccines has long been scientifically debunked.</p>
<p>He also questioned why Americans “are paying so much more than people
in other countries” for medicines.</p>
<p>Trump said that he was doing his best to stop Russia’s nearly
three-year war on Ukraine, and that he would have ongoing conversations
with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy about a halt to the fighting.</p>
<p>He called much of Ukraine “a demolition site” because of Russian
attacks. “People can’t go back there.”</p>
<p>Trump called the U.S. media “very corrupt” after winning a $15
million defamation settlement against ABC News over the weekend. He said
he is planning lawsuits against other news outlets and individual
journalists for what he considers to be false reporting, even as he lost
other media-related suits.</p>
<p>The president-elect reiterated his plan to impose tariffs against
imports from some of the U.S.’ biggest trading partners.</p>
<p>“Tariffs will make our country rich,” he contended, although
individual importers pay the fees and often pass on their costs to
customers buying the goods.</p>

Age of Electrons Has Arrived, but Maybe Not for the Right Reasons</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTMxNDg3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDI4MDE3OX0.ZypzORFj-Dlpz7PzR4bSL7JMOCXn4t8tIzyBahde8BU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The transition to clean energy is largely a shift from molecules to
electrons — gasoline in the tank is out, electricity stored in a battery
cell is in. It follows, then, that as the transition progresses, the
balance of power in the energy industry will shift from oil and gas
production to electricity generation.
</p>
<p>
We may look back on 2024 as the year the scales tipped. Among the top
260 publicly listed energy companies, utilities’ capital expenditures
around the globe were slightly higher this year than oil and gas
spending, according to a
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bcg-on-energy_north-america-utilities-data-center-demand-activity-7265316389505118208-_MST/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
analysis from Boston Consulting Group</u></a>, and the authors expect
the trend to grow through the end of the decade. But it wasn’t a sudden
spike in EV adoption or home electrification or some other climate
solution that put utility spending in the lead. It was the rise in data
centers.
</p>
<p>
“When we went through all the data, all the 260 companies, it was the
data centers that were having the biggest impact, most definitely,”
Rebecca Fitz, a partner and director at Boston Consulting Group and lead
author of the report, told me. “I’ve been in this sector for a long
time, and to have such a rapid change in demand outlook, coupled with
quick changes to capex, is a big story.”
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="6e7dc09050a5eee95851e3853886c6b1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="3b1df" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM1MTcyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NDExOTU3M30.b2Hd8XNclWXLRjA9pqf3HGAaZpnF9wvMthwU6jUp2V4/image.jpg?width=980"/>

</p>
<p>
The finding was the surprise headline of an annual report that Fitz’
group has completed for the past three years called “Follow the
Capital,” an analysis of what’s driving changes in capital supply and
demand in the energy sector using data culled from publicly available
sources. Data for prior years comes from regulatory and investor
fillings. Future years are modeled using public announcements, plans
filed with regulators, and a few conservative assumptions, Fitz told me.
</p>
<p>
Surging demand for electricity from data centers was perhaps the biggest
energy story of 2024, and the trend seemed to accelerate as the year
went on. In just the past few months, almost every major tech company
has signed an agreement to buy power from a nuclear plant, either
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear" target="_self"><u>reviving
formerly shuttered reactors</u></a> or
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helping
to build new ones</u></a>. GE Vernova, which manufactures energy
generation equipment,
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_investor_update_transcript_12102024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported
last week</u></a> that it had secured contracts for 9 gigawatts’ worth
of new gas turbines since its previous quarterly report in October,
“tied to both load growth in the U.S and … serving the hyperscaler
demand associated with AI.” As the “Follow the Capital” authors were
wrapping up this year’s edition in November, they found that U.S.
utilities had added $50 billion in planned capex during the third
quarter alone, mostly due to data center demand growth.
</p>
<p>
Data center demand isn’t the only factor playing into the above chart.
Though utility spending is definitely up, oil and gas companies are also
reining in capex growth in favor of shareholder returns, Fitz told me.
But oil and gas also sees the winds changing and is making moves to get
into the power business. Two weeks ago,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/bbWeRY9jK5c?t=1800s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>during
a panel hosted by the Atlantic Council</u></a>, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth
said the company was “looking at possible solutions to build large-scale
power generation” that would serve data centers directly, rather than
feed into the grid, so that regular electricity ratepayers would not
shoulder the costs. “There’s sensitivity to increasing electricity rates
for the average person just for the benefit of a few of these tech
companies,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Beating Chevron to the punch, last week ExxonMobil
<a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/what-we-do/delivering-industrial-solutions/carbon-capture-and-storage/steel-ammonia-ai-what-cant-ccs-help-decarbonize" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
that it was “moving fast” on this exact type of project, designing a
natural gas plant that would “use carbon capture to remove more than 90%
of the associated CO2 emissions” and directly power data centers without
connecting to the grid.
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt that most of the oil and gas sector is looking at
opportunities in this area,” said Fitz.
</p>
<p>
Though the report covers global companies and spending, the data center
demand signal is hyperlocal. Among the 30 largest North American
utilities, 65% of demand growth is concentrated within just six of them,
the report says. Though the report does not name the companies, Fitz
told me that Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio were seeing the
most aggressive plans.
</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence boosters often argue that this demand pull is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>boon
for the energy transition</u></a>. By ushering in the age of electrons,
the logic goes, tech companies with deep pockets can drive the first
deployments of new clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear and
geothermal power plants. These early deployments would then help lower
costs and give rise to cheaper, cleaner electricity for the rest of us
average energy consumers and our future electric cars, stoves, and water
heaters.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not the only potential outcome. “Follow the Capital” found
that when the six utilities most affected by demand growth recently
revised their integrated resource plans, they increased the amount of
natural gas generation they planned to add from 26% of total new
generation to 31%. As GE Vernova reported, orders for gas generators are
skyrocketing. “I can’t think of a time that the gas business has had
more fun than they’re having right now,” the company’s CEO Scott Strazik
said during a recent investor update.
</p>
<p>
As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>,
the industry is turning to natural gas plants because they can run 24/7
and they are not as dependent on transmission lines as renewables are,
so they can be built faster and more cheaply. Renewables paired with
energy storage are only competitive with gas if there’s infrastructure
to support it, sources told him.
</p>
<p>
The age of electrons may be nigh, but whether it helps to stop climate
change is a separate question altogether.

<h2 id="us-expands-reach-against-islamic-state-in-syria">US expands
reach against Islamic State in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The United States is moving to fill the power vacuum in
central Syria, worried the Islamic State terror group is looking to
exploit the victory of Syrian rebels over forces loyal to former
President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>U.S. warplanes Monday targeted IS camps and operatives in central
Syria, marking at least the second time the U.S. has hit the terror
group in areas formerly patrolled by Assad’s forces that had backing
from Russian troops and airpower.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle
East, said the latest round of airstrikes targeted leaders, operatives
and camps “in former regime and Russian-controlled areas.”</p>
<p>The goal, CENTCOM said, is to ensure “pressure is maintained” against
IS.</p>
<p>CENTCOM and Pentagon officials said Monday initial assessments
indicated the strikes killed12 IS members and that no civilians were
killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Neither CENTCOM nor the Pentagon offered additional details about the
targets of Monday’s airstrikes or their operational value.</p>
<p>The new strikes come just over a week after CENTCOM launched more
than a dozen strikes against 75 IS targets in five locations across
central Syria.</p>
<p>Officials at the time said the targets included “a significant
gathering of ISIS fighters and leaders.”</p>
<p>Pentagon officials on Monday said the U.S. would carry out additional
strikes as needed.</p>
<p>“In as much as CENTCOM sees a potential threat posed by ISIS, and to
mitigate their ability to be able to resurge, you’re going to see these
strikes,” said Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder, using
another acronym for the terror group.</p>
<p>Until the collapse of the Assad regime, however, much of central
Syria was a no-go zone for U.S. forces and their Syrian allies.</p>
<p>“One of the big factors that has changed in Syria is the airspace,”
Ryder told reporters Monday. “It previously had Syrian regime and
Russian air defenses, which would preclude in many cases our ability to
or desirability to go into those areas.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials and independent analysts have long warned of a growing
IS threat in areas of Syria under Assad’s control.</p>
<p>A United Nations report issued earlier this year, based on
intelligence from member states, warned the central Syria desert had
become “a logistics and operations hub with 500 to 600 fighters.”</p>
<p>More recently, U.S. officials warned that IS had been exploiting the
lack of pressure from Syrian and Russian forces to plan attacks across
the West.</p>
<p>IS has “used a base of operations in central Syria to drive external
plotting, turning this desert location into the current locus of
plotting against the West, including the United States,” Brett Holmgren,
acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said last
month.</p>

id="former-fbi-informant-pleads-guilty-to-lying-about-bribery-scheme-involving-bidens">Former
FBI informant pleads guilty to lying about bribery scheme involving
Bidens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — A former FBI informant pleaded guilty Monday to lying
about a phony bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden and his son
Hunter that became central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in
Congress. </p>
<p>Alexander Smirnov entered his plea to a felony charge in connection
with the bogus story, along with a tax evasion charge stemming from a
separate indictment accusing him of concealing millions of dollars of
income. </p>
<p>An attorney for Smirnov declined to comment after the hearing in Los
Angeles federal court. </p>
<p>Prosecutors and the defense have agreed to recommend a sentence of
between four and six years in prison when he’s sentenced next
month. </p>
<p>Smirnov will get credit for the time he has served since his February
arrest on charges that he told his FBI handler that executives from the
Ukrainian energy company Burisma had paid President Biden and Hunter
Biden $5 million each around 2015. </p>
<p>Smirnov had been an informant for more than a decade when he made the
explosive allegations about the Bidens in June 2020, after “expressing
bias” about Joe Biden as a presidential candidate, prosecutors
said. </p>
<p>But Smirnov had only routine business dealings with Burisma starting
in 2017, according to court documents. An FBI field office investigated
the allegations and recommended the case be closed in August 2020,
according to charging documents. </p>
<p>No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden acted corruptly or accepted
bribes as president or in his previous office as vice president. </p>
<p>While Smirnov’s identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment,
his claims played a major part in the Republican effort in Congress to
investigate the president and his family, and helped spark a House
impeachment inquiry into Biden. Before Smirnov’s arrest, Republicans had
demanded the FBI release the unredacted form documenting the unverified
allegations, though they acknowledged they couldn’t confirm if they were
true. </p>
<p>During a September 2023 conversation with investigators, Smirnov also
claimed the Russians probably had recordings of Hunter Biden because a
hotel in Ukraine’s capital where he had stayed was “wired” and under
their control — information he said was passed along to him by four
high-level Russian officials. </p>
<p>But Hunter Biden had never traveled to Ukraine, according to
Smirnov’s indictment. </p>
<p>Smirnov claimed to have contacts with Russian intelligence-affiliated
officials, and told authorities after his arrest this year that
“officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing
a story” about Hunter Biden. </p>
<p>The case against Smirnov was brought by special counsel David Weiss,
who also prosecuted Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. Hunter Biden
was supposed to be sentenced this month after being convicted at a trial
in the gun case and pleading guilty to federal charges in the tax case.
But he was pardoned this month by his father, who said he believed “raw
politics has infected this process, and it led to a miscarriage of
justice.”</p>

id="teacher-teenage-student-fatally-shot-at-christian-school-in-wisconsin">Teacher,
teenage student fatally shot at Christian school in Wisconsin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A teenage student opened fire with a handgun Monday at a Christian
school in Wisconsin, killing a teacher and another teenager during the
final week before Christmas break. The shooter also died, police
said. </p>
<p>The shooter also wounded six others at Abundant Life Christian
School, including two students, who were in critical condition, Madison
Police Chief Shon Barnes said. A teacher and three students were taken
to a hospital with less serious injuries, and two of them had been
released by Monday evening. </p>
<p>“Every child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a
victim forever. … We need to figure out and try to piece together what
exactly happened,” Barnes said. </p>
<p>Barbara Wiers, director of elementary and school relations for
Abundant Life Christian School, said students “handled themselves
magnificently.” </p>
<p>She said when the school practices safety routines, which it had done
just before the school year, leaders always announce that it is a drill.
That didn’t happen Monday. </p>
<p>“When they heard, ‘Lockdown, lockdown,’ they knew it was real,” she
said. </p>
<p>The shooter was a 17-year-old female student, a law enforcement
official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to
discuss the investigation and spoke to the AP on the condition of
anonymity. </p>
<p>Police said the shooter was dead by apparent suicide when officers
arrived. Barnes declined to give details about the shooter, partly out
of respect for the family. With a few rare exceptions, a 17-year-old
can’t legally possess a gun in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Barnes said investigators might have enough information to release
more details about the shooter in another press conference later
Monday. </p>
<p>He also warned people against sharing unconfirmed reports on social
media about the shooter’s identity. </p>
<p>“What that does is it helps erode the trust in this process,” he
said. </p>
<p>Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school —
prekindergarten through high school — with approximately 420 students in
Madison, the state capital. </p>
<p>Wiers said the school does not have metal detectors but uses other
security measures, including cameras. </p>
<p>Children and families were reunited at a medical building about a
mile away from the school. Parents pressed children against their chests
while others squeezed hands and shoulders as they walked side by side.
One girl was comforted with an adult-size coat around her shoulders as
she moved to a parking lot teeming with police vehicles. </p>
<p>A motive for the shooting was not immediately known, but Barnes said
officials were talking with the parents of the suspected shooter and
they were cooperating. He also said he didn’t know if the people shot
had been targeted. </p>
<p>“I don’t know why, and I feel like if we did know why, we could stop
these things from happening,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>A search warrant was issued Monday to a Madison home, he said. </p>
<p>Rapid response</p>
<p>Someone from the school called 911 to report an active shooter
shortly before 11 a.m. First responders who were in training just 3
miles (5 kilometers) away dashed to the school for an actual emergency,
Barnes said. They arrived 3 minutes after the initial call and went into
the building immediately. </p>
<p>Classes had been taking place when the shooting happened, Barnes
said. He declined to say where exactly in the school it happened. </p>
<p>Investigators believe the shooter used a 9 mm pistol, a law
enforcement official told the AP on the condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Police blocked off roads around the school, and federal agents were
at the scene to assist local law enforcement. No shots were fired by
police. </p>
<p>Abundant Life asked for prayers in a brief Facebook post. </p>
<p>Wiers said the school’s goal is to have staff get together early in
the week and have community opportunities for students to reconnect
before the winter break, but it’s still to be decided whether they will
resume classes this week. </p>
<p>Bethany Highman, the mother of a student, rushed to the school and
learned over FaceTime that her daughter was OK. </p>
<p>“As soon as it happened, your world stops for a minute. Nothing else
matters,” Highman said. “There’s nobody around you. You just bolt for
the door and try to do everything you can as a parent to be with your
kids.” </p>
<p>In a statement, President Joe Biden cited the tragedy in calling on
Congress to pass universal background checks, a national red flag law
and certain gun restrictions. </p>
<p>“We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children,
their families, and tears entire communities apart,” Biden said. </p>
<p>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said it’s “unthinkable” that a child or
teacher would go to school and never return home. </p>
<p>The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in
recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut;
Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. </p>
<p>The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and
frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to
doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings
have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. </p>
<p>Firearms were the leading cause of death among children in 2020 and
2021, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care
issues. </p>
<p>Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said the country needs to do more
to prevent gun violence. </p>
<p>“I hoped that this day would never come to Madison,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="taiwan-receives-first-batch-of-us-made-abrams-tanks">Taiwan
receives first batch of US-made Abrams tanks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan has received 38 advanced Abrams battle tanks
from the United States, the defense ministry said Monday, reportedly the
island’s first new tanks in 30 years.</p>
<p>Washington has long been Taipei’s most important ally and biggest
arms supplier — angering Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its own
territory.</p>
<p>The M1A2 tanks — the first batch of 108 ordered in 2019 — arrived in
Taiwan late Sunday and were transferred to an army training base in
Hsinchu, south of the capital Taipei, the defense ministry said.</p>
<p>The M1A2s are the first new tanks to be delivered to Taiwan in 30
years, the semi-official Central News Agency said.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s current tank force consists of around 1,000 Taiwan-made CM
11 Brave Tiger and U.S.-made M60A3 tanks, technology that is
increasingly obsolete.</p>
<p>Abrams tanks, which are among the heaviest in the world, are a
mainstay of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Taiwan faces the constant threat of an invasion by China, which has
refused to rule out using force to bring the self-ruled island under its
control.</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry on Monday urged the United States to “stop
arming Taiwan… and supporting Taiwan independence forces.”</p>
<p>“The Taiwan authorities’ attempt to seek independence through force
and foreign help is doomed to fail,” ministry spokesman Lin Jian
said.</p>
<p>“China will firmly defend its national sovereignty, security and
territorial integrity.”</p>
<p>While it has a home-grown defense industry and has been upgrading its
equipment, Taiwan relies heavily on U.S. arms sales to bolster its
security capabilities.</p>
<p>Taiwan requested the state-of-the-art M1A2 tanks in 2019, allocating
the equivalent of more than $1.2 billion for them. The rest of the order
is expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, an army official told
AFP.</p>
<p>While U.S. arms supplies to Taiwan are enshrined into law, a massive
backlog caused by Covid-19 supply chain disruptions and U.S. weapons
shipments to Ukraine and Israel have slowed deliveries to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The backlog now exceeds $21 billion, according to Washington think
tank Cato Institute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiwan would be massively outgunned in terms of troop numbers and
firepower in any war with China and in recent years has increased
spending on its military.</p>
<p>Taipei allocated a record $19 billion for 2024 and next year’s budget
is set to hit a new high as it seeks to bolster its defense
approach.</p>
<p>China has increased military pressure on Taiwan in recent years,
regularly deploying fighter jets and warships around the island.</p>
<p>Taiwanese authorities said last week that China had held its biggest
maritime drills in years, with around 90 ships deployed from near the
southern islands of Japan to the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The vessels simulated attacks on foreign ships and practiced
blockading sea routes, a Taiwan security official said previously.</p>
<p>Beijing did not confirm the drills and its defense ministry did not
say whether the maneuvers had taken place when asked at a press
conference on Friday.</p>

Thousands of people could be dead in the small island region of Mayotte
after Tropical Cyclone Chido swept through on Saturday. The islands,
home to some 300,000, are French territory but located in the Indian
Ocean between Madagascar and the east coast of Africa. Sources have
reported apocalyptic scenes of destruction, with entire neighborhoods
gone and essential infrastructure wiped out. “There is nothing left,” a

CNN. “It’s as if an atomic bomb fell.” The cyclone struck as a Category
4 storm, with 136-mph winds, making it the strongest storm to hit the
islands in nearly 100 years. So far 14 people are confirmed to have
perished, but that death toll is expected to rise. According to CNN, the
worst damage is in slum regions where thousands of undocumented migrants
reside.

</h3>
<p>
With the end of President Biden’s term rapidly approaching, his
administration is racing to finalize some key environmental decisions
and finance deals. For example, the Energy Department’s Loan Programs
Office has a handful of “conditional” commitments for clean tech (like a
$6.6 billion loan to Rivian, and a $7.5 billion loan for a battery plant
built by the Stellantis and Samsung joint venture) that are in limbo and
could be nixed by the Trump administration. Officials are “working hard
to make the loan guarantees and loan agreements as airtight as
possible,” a former policy adviser for the LPO

the coming weeks:

soon as this week</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency on
whether California can ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.
Reports suggest the agency will grant its approval, which would also
apply to about a dozen other states. Trump is expected to reverse the
rule, likely setting up a long legal battle.

<p class="drop-caps">
Donald Trump hasn’t taken office yet, but the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/politics/elon-musk-trump-campaign-finance-filings/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quarter
of a billion dollars</u></a> Elon Musk invested in Trump’s victory is
already paying off in ways large and small. On Friday, Reuters
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-recommends-scrapping-car-crash-reporting-requirement-opposed-by-2024-12-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that the Trump transition team is looking to scrap a National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration crash-reporting requirement, “a move that
could cripple the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the
safety of vehicles with automated-driving systems.” Tesla finds this
requirement irksome, and lo, it may soon disappear.
</p>
<p>
In the scope of Musk’s emerging sway over the Trump administration and
the course of federal policy in the coming years, it’s a relatively
minor story of potentially corrupt influence and the subversion of the
public interest. But an even more disturbing picture of Musk’s full
priority set is coming into focus.
</p>
<p>
Musk, the richest human being in history (his net worth
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/business/elon-musk-400-billion-net-worth/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
tops</u></a> $400 billion), may soon exercise a control over government
policy unprecedented for a private citizen, which as recently as a year
or so ago might have seemed like a net positive for the fight against
climate change. Until the relatively immediate present, Musk was rightly
counted as a hero of that battle. Whether or not you accept
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h4ZoGASM8bI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
claim</u></a> that “I’ve done more for the environment than any single
human on Earth,” Musk has certainly done more than anyone to promote the
adoption of electric vehicles. And no public figure could — if he wanted
— have more ability to convince conservatives in general, and Donald
Trump in particular, to accept the reality of climate change and commit
to doing something about it than he does.
</p>
<p>
But that is not what Elon Musk wants. It is becoming clear that in
pursuit of his own objectives — money, power, domination over others,
personal aggrandizement, and the realization of
<a href="https://www.spacex.com/media/making_life_multiplanetary_transcript_2017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
dream</u></a> of making humanity a “multi-planet species” — Musk is
content not just to set aside the fight against climate change, but to
actively undermine it.
</p>
<p>
While Musk has not made any grand announcement declaring that he no
longer cares about climate, there is considerable evidence to suggest he
does not. In
<a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
rambling interview</u></a> with Trump this August, Musk said that his
views on the fossil fuel industry are “probably different from what most
people would assume.” He explained that “I don’t think we should vilify
the oil and gas industry,” and although over time we should move toward
sustainable energy, “we still have quite a bit of time … we don’t need
to rush and we don’t need to stop farmers from farming or prevent people
from having steaks.”
</p>
<p>
Which is almost exactly what any
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis" target="_self"><u>fossil
fuel CEO</u></a> would say.
</p>
<p>
It certainly marks a rhetorical shift for someone who once
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/Elon-Musk-thinks-we-need-a-popular-uprising-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry/articleshow/55233184.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated</u></a>
a “popular uprising” against fossil fuel companies. One might object
that whatever he says in interviews, he’s still the CEO of America’s
largest EV manufacturer. And Tesla no doubt remains a company filled
with people committed to combating climate change who see their work as
a key part of that effort.
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/Tesla-Master-Plan-Part-3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
third iteration</u></a> of the company’s “Master Plan,” released last
year, describes what it believes is necessary to “fully electrify the
economy and eliminate fossil fuel use.”
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t seem to reflect the CEO’s own thinking. The
<em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/elon-musk-climate-change-worldview-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that earlier this year, Musk killed plans to create an affordable Tesla
that could have greatly expanded the reach of EVs in the U.S., opting
instead to make further investments in luxury cars and artificial
intelligence. (To add insult to injury, Reuters first reported in April
that the car had been canceled, but Musk said that the outlet was
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2#:~:text=Tesla%20has%20denied%20the%20reporting.%20In%20a%20post%20on%20the%20social%20network%20X%2C%20Elon%20Musk%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20lying%20(again).%E2%80%9D%20He%20later%20added%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20dying.%E2%80%9D" target="_self"><u>lying</u></a>.”)
“The internal deliberations over the so-called Tesla Model 2,” said the
<em><em>Post</em></em>, “reflect what sources close to Musk describe as
a significant shift in the billionaire’s attitude toward climate
change.”
</p>
<p>
That’s apparent in what may be the single most important decision Trump
and congressional Republicans will have to make with regard to EVs:
whether to kill the $7,500 EV subsidy revived and expanded by the
Inflation Reduction Act. If Musk wanted to, he could almost certainly
convince Trump that the subsidies ought to remain in place. But he
doesn’t; this summer he said on an earnings call that while eliminating
the subsidies might cost Tesla some sales, “long term, it probably
actually helps” because it would be “devastating for our competitors.”
Or as he said in
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813112958157005259" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
tweet</u></a>, “Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, Musk favors a policy change that will reduce overall
adoption of EVs, because it will hurt his competition, perhaps driving
some of his competitors out of the EV market entirely. Bad for the
climate, but good for Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>
Then we have the rest of the Trump administration’s agenda to roll back
climate progress. To date there is zero evidence that Musk has suggested
that Trump dial back his “drill, baby, drill” agenda or appoint
administration figures who are anything less than fossil fuel
enthusiasts. Quite the opposite: When Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-expedited-permitting" target="_blank">posted
on Truth Social</a> that “Any person or company investing ONE BILLION
DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of America, will receive fully
expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to,
all Environmental approvals,” Musk responded by
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1866571568266219998" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tweeting</u></a>,
“This is awesome.”
</p>
<p>
That it isn’t in Trump’s power to single-handedly waive “all
Environmental approvals” isn’t the point, so much as the fact that Musk
thrills to the idea of the government no longer bothering to enforce
environmental laws. While the “Department of Government Efficiency”
Trump has tasked Musk with creating is neither a department, nor part of
the government, nor devoted to efficiency, it nonetheless stands as a
symbol of Musk’s close relationship with Trump and his ability to
influence Trump’s decisions, particularly given how little Trump
actually cares about policy areas other than immigration and foreign
trade. It has become hard to envision Musk acting as anything other than
an accelerant on Trump’s worst environmental instincts.
</p>
<p>
Musk’s shift to the right will continue to have serious national
consequences in both government policy and public debate. He bought
Twitter in 2022 with the stated intention of removing much of its
content moderation in the name of “free speech,” with the predictable
result that the renamed X quickly became a sewer of far-right extremism
and misinformation of all kinds. As multiple
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10122024/todays-climate-climate-misinformation-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analyses</u></a>
have
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-science-social-media-a7e2e3214abb4470dcb6e2837aa39c2e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shown</u></a>,
climate denialism and deceit have proliferated on X, making it one of
the premier vectors of influence for those who would thwart efforts to
address the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
There is no reason to believe that this concerns Musk in any way. The
man who once had the key insight that the way to fight climate change
was to make EVs cool now thinks nothing is cooler than getting retweets
and likes from the right-wing trolls who consider him their king.
</p>
<p>
At this point, one might even question whether Musk
<em><em>ever</em></em> cared about climate change, or if concern about
warming was just an engine that he realized could make him rich and feed
his grandiose dreams of world domination. The answer to that question
is: It doesn’t matter. Whatever he might once have thought, Musk has
been transformed. He is no longer a force for good in the climate fight;
instead, he’ll be one more obstacle to ensuring the future of the
planet. If only he didn’t have the ability to do so much damage.

Harris thank donors, urge them to stay engaged after tough loss to
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on
Sunday thanked deep-pocketed Democratic donors who raised record sums in
last month’s election loss to President-elect Donald Trump and urged
them not to lose hope and to remain politically engaged.</p>
<p>Biden and Harris, along with their spouses, in remarks at the
Democratic National Committee holiday reception sought to buck up key
donors who the Democratic Party needs to stay committed as it tries to
pick up the pieces. Republicans scored a decisive victory taking the
White House and Senate while maintaining control of the House in an
election where donors of all political stripes spent about $4.7
billion.</p>
<p>“We all get knocked down. My dad would say when you get knocked down,
you just got to get up,” Biden said. “The measure of a person or a party
is how fast they get back up.”</p>
<p>Harris, who stepped in as the party’s presidential nominee after
Biden ended his campaign in July following his disastrous debate
performance, praised donors for putting their time — and checkbooks —
into backing her and Democrats that they believed in.</p>
<p>Democrats, their allied super PACs and other groups raised about $2.9
billion, compared to about $1.8 billion for the Republicans. Harris
noted that Democrats raised a whopping $700 million over just 700 events
organized by the Democratic finance committee.</p>
<p>“You rallied, you opened your homes, you reached out to your friends
and your family,” said Harris, who will soon begin weighing in earnest
her own future and whether to make another White House run. “You put
your personal capital — and by that I mean your relationships — at stake
to talk with people because you care so deeply, and you connected with
people and took the time to remind them of what is at stake and what was
at stake.”</p>
<p>While Biden acknowledged the sting that Democrats continue to feel
about last month’s loss, he said they should take pride in what they
accomplished.</p>
<p>The administration’s signature achievements include a $1 trillion
bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost
semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., and a surge in federal
environmental spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden
signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic

across US bring heavy snow, dangerous ice, tornado in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Omaha, Nebraska — A tornado near a mall in central California swept
up cars, uprooted trees and sent several people to the hospital. In San
Francisco, authorities issued the first-ever tornado warning.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, inclement weather plagued areas of the U.S., with
dangerous conditions including heavy snow in upstate New York, a major
ice storm in Midwest states and severe weather warnings around Lake
Tahoe. </p>
<p>The ice storm beginning Friday evening created treacherous driving
conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska Friday and into Saturday and
prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and
trucks slid off the road. In upstate New York, more than 33 inches (84
centimeters) was reported near Orchard Park, which is often a landing
point for lake-effect snow.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a tornado touched down near a shopping mall in Scotts
Valley, California, about 110 kilometers south of San Francisco, around
1:40 p.m. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility
poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police
Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, some trees toppled onto cars and streets and
damaged roofs. The  </p>
<p>damage was due to 129-kph straight-line winds, not a tornado, weather
 </p>
<p>service meteorologist Dalton Behringer said Sunday.</p>
<p>Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the weather service’s office in
Monterey, California, said the warning of a possible tornado in San
Francisco was a first for the city, noting an advanced alert did not go
out before the last tornado struck nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a warning
in 2005,” said Gass, who was not there at the time.</p>
<p>The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take
shelter, but few people have basements in the area.</p>
<p>More than 30 centimeters of snow fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts,
and 181-kph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort
south of Yosemite National Park, according to the weather service’s
office in Reno, Nevada. Up to 90 centimeters of snow was forecast for
the Sierra Nevada mountaintops.</p>
<p>The weekend Tahoe Live music festival at Palisades Tahoe ski resort
in California went ahead as planned in spite of a snowstorm Saturday.
Lil Wayne and Diplo were scheduled to perform Sunday, the festival’s
website said. An avalanche warning was in effect at least until Monday
morning in the area.</p>
<p>Interstate 80 was closed along a 130-kilometer stretch from
Applegate, California, to the Nevada line just west of Reno on Saturday.
The California Highway Patrol reopened the road in the afternoon for
passenger vehicles with chains or four-wheel drive and snow tires.</p>
<p>The severe weather in the Midwest resulted in at least one death. The
Washington County Sheriff’s office in Nebraska said a 57-year-old woman
died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington
and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor
injuries.</p>
<p>Businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as temperatures rose
high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places.</p>
<p>“Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it
temporary,” said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people in western Washington state lost
electricity Saturday as the system delivered rain and gusty winds, local
news outlets reported.</p>

Pole’ flight takes kids to Santa in transformed Denver airport
hangar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado — Dozens of kids cheered on a festively decked-out
plane in Denver on Saturday when the pilot announced their destination
for the day: the North Pole.</p>
<p>More than 100 children, some of whom have serious health issues, were
then taken on a roughly 45-minute flight near the city before landing
back at Denver International Airport and being towed to a hangar
transformed by United Airlines employees and volunteers into the North
Pole.</p>
<p>Streamers, paper snowflakes and tufts of cotton resembling feathery
snow dotted the plane and seats. Flight personnel paraded a bubble
machine up and down the aisle to shouts of “bubbles, bubbles, bubbles”
from the excited children. Holiday songs played in the background and
there were apple snacks and juice for all.</p>
<p>Before landing, the children were asked to close their window shades.
When they opened, the kids were met by the sight of a waiting Santa and
Mrs. Claus and a host of elves. An ice cream truck was on hand and the
children received gifts.</p>
<p>Bryce Bosley, 6, was tickled to see Santa and all the North Pole had
to offer.</p>
<p>“The North Pole is fun because there’s games, food, and all the
activities are really fun,” he said.</p>
<p>United Capt. Bob Zimmermann, the holiday flight’s pilot, was struck
by the joy and wonder of the youngsters.</p>
<p>“Throughout the year I’ll think of the fantasy flight,” he said.
“When life seems to get tough or I want to complain about something, I
remember these kids and the joy and the love and what this feels like,
and it just keeps my life in perspective.”</p>
<p>United partnered with Make-A-Wish Colorado, Girls Inc., Children’s
Hospital Colorado and Rocky Mountain Down Syndrome Association to invite
Denver-area kids ages 3 to 10 years on the flight.</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, United has staged its annual “fantasy
flights” to fictional North Poles at airports around the world to bring
holiday cheer to children and their families.</p>
<p>This year they took place in 13 cities, starting Dec. 5 in Honolulu
and then in Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San
Francisco, Tokyo, Cleveland and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the
island of Guam. Newark, New Jersey, also had a flight Saturday.</p>
<p>Jonna McGrath, United’s vice president for operations at its Denver
hub, has participated in 29 flights and said it is one of her favorite
days of the year.</p>
<p>“It gives them a day where they are away from some of the challenges
they face in their day-to-day life,” said McGrath, who was dressed as an
elf. “Bringing a little magic and some gifts to their holiday season is
something they’ll never forget.”</p>

id="tis-the-season-for-roasting-chestnuts.-but-in-us-native-ones-are-almost-gone">’Tis
the season for roasting chestnuts. But in US, native ones are almost
gone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut
on city sidewalks. It’s no longer the variety whose smell some people
associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it’s
virtually extinct. </p>
<p>But memories of the American chestnut’s legacy keep resurfacing for
the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that
paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the
photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags
of nuts cooked on charcoal. </p>
<p>“You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to
utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in
virtually every aspect of the lives of people,” said Sara Fern
Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut
Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once
did. </p>
<p>Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many
chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with
attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the
invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If
and when they do find the right variety, they’ll need to figure out how
to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from
climate change, globalization and development. </p>
<p>Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American
chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems
underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal
blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties,
like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to
the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter
snacking. </p>
<p>Still, American chestnut trees are better-suited for timber, they’re
culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an
important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a
reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans
alike. “It was really a pretty significant species to lose,” said Amy
Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree’s
genetics. “The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest
ecosystem is.” </p>
<p>The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for
decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with
the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said
breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance
involves several different genes, and it has proven hard to separate
them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. </p>
<p>To speed the process, some scientists have been working on
genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their
immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up
involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that
scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through
the regulatory process as soon as this year. </p>
<p>“It kind of stinks that it happened because now it’s taking a little
bit longer than we had hoped,” said Linda McGuigan, a research support
specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are
continuing to pursue many avenues. </p>
<p>“I don’t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,”
Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic
modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity
for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she
thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight
resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another
big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful
tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to
New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a
warming planet is changing habitat around the world? </p>
<p>A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to
answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared
them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance
that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset
warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while
keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s hyperbolic to say it’s revolutionary” for teams
at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed
data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure
out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across
the country. </p>
<p>Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of
Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American
chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it
“robust and well supported” and “critically important to the success of
the chestnut.” </p>
<p>Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the
findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with
real-world experiments. “I think with advancements in genetics, they can
probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all
of that takes time and effort, right?” </p>
<p>For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their
lifetimes. It’s a lesson that became clear for the community when
pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard
both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their
research for years as lab manager at SUNY’s college of environmental
science and forestry. </p>
<p>“The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,” McGuigan
said. “I want to do something good for the future, for my children.”</p>

id="kraven-the-hunter-flops-while-moana-2-tops-the-box-office-again">‘Kraven
the Hunter’ flops while ‘Moana 2’ tops the box office again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Spider-Man spinoff “Kraven the Hunter” got off to a disastrous
start in North American theaters this weekend. </p>
<p>The movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson earned only $11 million,
according to studio estimates Sunday, making it one of the worst
openings for a Marvel-adjacent property. Its box office take was even
less than the film “Madame Web.” </p>
<p>The weekend’s other major studio release was Warner Bros.’ animated
“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” which made $4.6
million. Made for about $30 million, the movie is set 183 years before
the events of “The Lord of the Rings” films and was fast-tracked to
ensure New Line did not lose the rights to Tolkien’s novels. Peter
Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have been working on future
live-action films for the franchise. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the top of the charts again belonged to “Moana 2” and
“Wicked.” </p>
<p>“Moana” added $26.6 million to its domestic total in its third
weekend and $57.2 million internationally, bringing its global tally to
$717 million. It’s now the fourth highest grossing film of the year,
surpassing “Dune: Part Two.” </p>
<p>“Wicked,” which is in its fourth weekend, brought in another $22.5
million to take second place. The Universal musical has made over $359
million domestically and over $500 million worldwide. </p>
<p>“Gladiator II” also made $7.8 million, bringing its domestic total to
$145.9 million in four weeks. </p>
<p>“Kraven the Hunter” is the latest misfire from Sony in its attempt to
mine the Spider-Man universe for spin-off franchises without the
lucrative web slinger himself. “Kraven” joins “Madame Web” and “Morbius”
in franchise additions that fell flat with both audiences and critics.
The one exception on this rollercoaster journey has been the “Venom”
trilogy, which has made over $1.8 billion worldwide. </p>
<p>The R-rated “Kraven the Hunter” was directed by J.C. Chandor and
faced a number of delays, partly due to the Hollywood strikes. It was
shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in
January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was
co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its
potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15%
“fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from
opening weekend audiences. </p>
<p>“It’s not always a guarantee that you’ll be able to connect with
audiences when you have a spinoff character,” said Paul Dergarabedian,
the senior media analyst for Comscore. “General audiences seem to want
to know exactly what they’re getting.” </p>
<p>Several awards contenders opened in limited release over the weekend,
including Paramount’s “September 5” about ABC’s coverage of the Munich
Olympics hostage crisis. Amazon MGM and Orion’s “Nickel Boys,” based on
Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-winner about an abusive reform school in
Florida, opened in two theaters in New York. It averaged $30,422 per
screen and will be expanding to Los Angeles before going nationwide in
the coming weeks. </p>
<p>Some big hitters are on the way in the home stretch of the 2024 box
office. “Mufasa” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” will hit in the coming weeks
along with a bevy of arthouse and adult releases like “Babygirl,”
“Nosferatu” and “A Complete Unknown.” </p>
<p>The box office has seen a dramatic recovery since June, when it was
down nearly 28% from the previous year. The deficit now stands at
4.8%. </p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Moana 2,” $26.6 million. </p></li>
<li><p>“Wicked,” $22.5 million. </p></li>

id="incoming-national-security-adviser-calls-for-explanation-of-us-drone-sightings">Incoming
national security adviser calls for explanation of US drone
sightings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security
adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones
flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill
intent is involved.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join
Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January
20, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We need to get to the
bottom of it.”</p>
<p>For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders
New York City, and other states to the north and south along the
Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed
drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated.</p>
<p>All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the
unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the
deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern
coastal waters.</p>
<p>Waltz called them “long-loitering, could-be dangerous” drones. He
credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying
to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no
explanation himself.</p>
<p>“We need more transparency,” Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a
Democrat, told the CBS show. “This can’t be the future.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of
Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that
most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state
with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and
posed no national security threat.</p>
<p>An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50
local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100
of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit
further investigation.</p>
<p>“The combination of efforts so far … to include technical equipment,
tip line information and noted consults has … not found any evidence to
support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities,” the official
said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight
paths.</p>
<p>The official said more investigations are under way to look at the
remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence.</p>
<p>“We can’t ignore the sightings that have been there,” the official
said. “We’re doing our best to find the origin of those drone
activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction” in the
number of claimed drone sightings.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military
bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence
that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security
officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been
operating the unexplained drones.</p>
<p>State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed
concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media
Friday that he had seen “what appeared to be dozens of large drones in
the sky” above his residence in the state. “The public is growing
increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of
transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.”</p>
<p>President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden
administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and
that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative
Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the
White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been “dismissive.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey
officials radar technology with an “electro-optical infrared camera
system” to track the devices.</p>
<p>Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said
an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal
activity.</p>
<p>“To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that
many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are
being operated lawfully,” Kirby said.</p>

drone sightings keep happening in New Jersey - What we know… and don’t
know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over
parts of New Jersey and the East Coast in recent weeks, sparking
speculation and concern over who sent them and why.</p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for
answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a
drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.</p>
<p>Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones
don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and
municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who
can fly the unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked
residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have
about the drones.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with the drones in New Jersey?</p>
<p>Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting
in November.</p>
<p>At first they were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River,
which feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state’s largest aquifer,
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.</p>
<p>But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the
Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and
over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.</p>
<p>The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding
officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Guard lifeboat near
Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Federal officials offer assurances that drones don’t pose a
threat</p>
<p>The growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden
administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing
with the matter more aggressively.</p>
<p>In a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White
House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies
sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or
public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor.</p>
<p>An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground
rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable
but added, “I think there has been a slight overreaction.”</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the
military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of
Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones
are not of foreign origin — remained unchanged.</p>
<p>New Jersey congressman wants the military to take action</p>
<p>A New Jersey congressman has urged the Pentagon to authorize the use
of force to bring down one or more drones to try to figure out who
deployed them.</p>
<p>The objects could be downed over the ocean or in an unpopulated area
on land, Smith said Saturday at a news conference.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we bag at least one of these drones and get to the bottom
of it?” Smith said.</p>
<p>Rep. Jeff Van Drew, another Republican Jersey Shore-area congressman,
has also called for the military to shoot down the drones.</p>
<p>Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said people should not take it
into their own hands to shoot down drones, which would break state and
federal laws.</p>
<p>Drones have been spotted over New York City</p>
<p>Drone sightings have now been reported in New York, where a permit is
required, and Mayor Eric Adams said the city was investigating and
collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.</p>
<p>The runways at Stewart International Airport — about 60 miles (100
kilometers) north of the city — were shut down for about one hour Friday
night because of drone activity in the airspace, Gov. Kathy Hochul
said.</p>
<p>“This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>The governor called on Congress to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of
drones and give more investigative authority to state and local law
enforcement.</p>
<p>“Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is
essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local
officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional
federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure
the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”</p>
<p>Are these drones dangerous?</p>
<p>The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings
shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown
lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.</p>
<p>The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint
statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national
security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of
Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8
meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off.
This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists, and
she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as
helicopter and radio.</p>
<p>Who sent the drones?</p>
<p>Authorities say they do not know.</p>
<p>The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the
sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has
been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in
a coordinated effort.</p>
<p>Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the
drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents.</p>
<p>Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have
found no evidence to support those concerns, but Rep. Smith on Saturday
echoed such speculation.</p>
<p>“The elusive maneuvering of these drones suggests a major military
power sophistication that begs the question whether they have been
deployed to test our defense capabilities — or worse — by violent
dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea,”
he said.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft
are not U.S. military drones.</p>
<p>What have officials said about the sightings?</p>
<p>Trump has said he believes the government knows more than it’s
saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he
posted on his social media site.</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday that the drones
should be “shot down, if necessary.”</p>
<p>“We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take
them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or
military bases,” Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.</p>
<p>Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round
Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she
doesn’t believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public
safety.</p>
<p>“How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it
is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”</p>
<p>Are drones allowed in New Jersey?</p>
<p>The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in
the state, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation
Administration regulations and flight restrictions.</p>
<p>In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an
unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>Operators must be FAA-certified.</p>
<p>Have drones been spotted anywhere else?</p>
<p>Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia
Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.</p>
<p>The object was over the ocean, and they watched as it slowly moved
over an Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The
Virginian-Pilot.</p>
<p>“It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what
he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.</p>
<p>“It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.</p>
<p>The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in
the area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton”
Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under
investigation.</p>
<p>Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana
Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia
Beach, is aware of recent reports of sightings in the area and is
coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its
personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said
Friday by email.</p>
<p>Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, 10 to 15 drones were reported hovering over a home
Thursday night in Harwich on Cape Cod. A resident told police they were
bright and she observed them for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Earlier that evening, an off-duty police officer in the same town
noticed similar activity near a public safety complex, police said. The
information was forwarded to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.</p>
<p>Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force
said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military
bases in England that are used by American forces.</p>

id="hackers-demand-ransom-from-rhode-islanders-after-data-breach">Hackers
demand ransom from Rhode Islanders after data breach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Rhode Island residents’ personal and bank
information, including Social Security numbers, were likely hacked by an
international cybercriminal group asking for a ransom, state officials
said on Saturday. </p>
<p>In what Rhode Island officials described as extortion, the hackers
threatened to release the stolen information unless they were paid an
undisclosed amount of money. </p>
<p>The breached data affects people who use the state’s government
assistance programs and includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, or SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and healthcare
purchased through the state’s HealthSource RI, Governor Dan McKee
announced on Friday. </p>
<p>Hackers gained access to RIBridges, the state’s online portal for
obtaining social services earlier this month, the governor’s office said
in a statement, but the breach was not confirmed by its vendor,
Deloitte, until Friday. </p>
<p>“Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a
cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable
information from RIBridges,” the governor’s office said in a statement
on Saturday. </p>
<p>A representative from McKee’s office was not immediately available to
Reuters for comment. </p>
<p>Anyone who has applied for or received benefits through those
programs since 2016 could be affected. </p>
<p>The state directed Deloitte to shut down RIBridges to remediate the
threat, and for the time being, anyone applying for new benefits will
have to do so on paper applications until the system is back up. </p>
<p>Households believed to have been affected will receive a letter from
the state notifying them of the problem and explaining steps to be taken
to help protect their data and bank accounts.</p>

encase Iowa, eastern Nebraska in ice; trigger tornado warning in
California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OMAHA, NEBRASKA — A major ice storm created treacherous driving
conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska this weekend and prompted
temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid
off the road. </p>
<p>Many events were canceled across the region when the storm hit Friday
evening, and businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as
officials urged people to stay home if possible. Temperatures rose high
enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places, however. </p>
<p>“Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it
temporary,” said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa. </p>
<p>At least one person died in a crash caused by the icy roads in
eastern Nebraska. The Washington County Sheriff’s office said a
57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway
30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained
minor injuries. </p>
<p>Trees topple</p>
<p>Elsewhere a storm and wind gusts of up to 96 kilometers per hour
prompted the first tornado warning in San Francisco, California, and
caused some damage. Parts of neighboring San Mateo County were also
included in the warning, which went out at 5:51 a.m. to about 1 million
people in the area. It was lifted by 6:15 a.m. </p>
<p>The storm toppled trees onto cars and streets and damaged some roofs
in San Francisco, which has not seen a tornado since 2005, according to
the Weather Service. The damage was being assessed to determine if there
was indeed a tornado. </p>
<p>“This was the first-ever warning for a possible tornado in San
Francisco. I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a
warning in 2005,” said Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the Weather
Service’s Monterey, California. He said he was not there in 2005. </p>
<p>The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take
shelter, but few people have basements in the area. </p>
<p>“The biggest thing that we tell people in the city is to put as many
walls between you and the outside as possible,” meteorologist Dalton
Behringer said. </p>
<p>Snow falls at ski resorts</p>
<p>In upstate New York, people were digging out after heavy snow fell.
More than 84 centimeters was reported near Orchard Park, where residents
are used to dealing with lake-effect snow this time of year. </p>
<p>And in Nevada, up to 91 centimeters of snow was forecast for Sierra
Nevada mountaintops, with a winter storm warning in effect through 10
p.m. More than one-third of a meter fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts,
according to the National Weather Service’s Reno office. </p>
<p>Interstate 80 was closed for about an 130-kilometer stretch from
Applegate, California, to the Nevada state line just west of Reno, where
rain was falling and a winter weather advisory remained in effect
through the afternoon. </p>
<p>In western Washington, tens of thousands of people lost electricity
Saturday, local news outlets reported, amid a system that brought rain
and gusty winds.</p>
