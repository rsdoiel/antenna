<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Most of us can only wonder what goes on in U.S. national security
leaders’ group chats, but The Atlantic’s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey
Goldberg doesn’t have to. Last week, Goldberg was accidentally included
in a Signal group chat with high-ranking members of the Donald Trump
administration, in which they discussed imminent war operations. Yes,
this actually happened. Plus, the whopping $2.1 billion verdict you
might’ve missed over Roundup weed killer. And, we smile over what’s
happened since congestion pricing went into effect in Manhattan — all
while dropping some Latin vocab.
