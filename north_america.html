      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing a special bonus episode from “How We Survive.” It’s a conversation between host Amy Scott, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Elizabeth Kolbert. Together, they dig into how the climate crisis is triggering economic disruption.

      <h1>On the brink of a shutdown, markets don't care</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump and congressional leaders are meeting at the White House on Monday to try and avoid a government shutdown. But both sides are digging their heels in. This brinksmanship is happening the same week we are set to get some pretty important government data. Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, and a professor at the University of Texas-Austin, joins us to talk about it. Plus, has Canada lost its trade dispute with the U.S.?</p>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Texas oil and gas firms are feeling pessimistic about the upcoming year. In the latest Dallas Fed survey, energy firms reported lower production, increased costs and heightened uncertainty. Oil is a good chunk of the Texas economy, and the Texas economy is a good chunk of the U.S. economy — around 9%. Also on the show: auto parts manufacturer First Brands files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the USDA revives its farm-to-school grant program.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The decision at Toyota in Brazil comes after intense storms halted production at its factories in the state of Sao Paulo, and many of the workers will be paid in full during the closed period. Hackers have attempted to recruit the BBC's cyber correspondent into helping them infiltrate the broadcaster's systems. And has Canada lost in the trade war with the U.S.? Over the past month, it’s removed billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on American goods.</p>

      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row.

      President Trump has ordered steep new tariffs on imported drugs, home furnishings, and trucks. The president's import taxes are pushing inflation higher. But that's not slowing consumer spending.

      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more. And later, we'll learn why so much foreign investment is still flowing to the U.S.</p>

That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more.

      <p>A lunch out may give you sticker shock, but a popping boba won't pop the budget, right? While some consumers are trying to be more money-conscious, many are still spending big on eating and drinking out. Chains like Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are all trying to cash in — in part by offering fancier, pricier, non-alcoholic drinks. Also on the program, we'll check in on New England's economy.</p>

Thing is, station groups Nexstar and Sinclair — which control ABC affiliates that reach about 20% of the country — opted out. Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners.

      <h1>Can the bull market last?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>Stocks are on a winning streak. The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on Friday. Now, everything that goes up can go down, but there are some reasons to think the bulls may stick around for a while. We'll hear more. And later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is pushing for stricter regulations on drug advertising. What could change?</p>

      <p>Here’s cautionary tale for you, out of China, about a young woman who says she fell in love with an artificial intelligence chatbot. There have been well-publicized instances of people seeking companionship from chatbots and it leading to tragedy. In this instance, it caused heartbreak. The story involves the Chinese AI firm Deepseek which, earlier this year, launched a chatbot that's almost as good as its American rivals. Soon after the launch, a young woman began a conversation with that chatbot. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak takes the story from there.</p>

      <h1>Who pays for tariffs?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p>The import price index, which keeps track of the price of imports before tariffs are applied, comes out tomorrow. You can tell by looking at it who exactly is paying for tariffs. Prices in certain categories have fallen in recent months — a sign that some foreign exporters are trying to offset the cost of tariffs. But first: The U.S. and China are talking trade, and consumers continue to spend despite economic anxieties.</p>

      <h1>Is TikTok’s time up in the U.S.?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> As U.S. and Chinese officials hold trade talks in Spain’s capital, the deadline approaches for TikTok, which U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban over security worries. Then, the U.S. and U.K. have lined up a string of deals aimed at speeding up nuclear power projects. And, Ghana is the world’s largest importer of used clothing, but about 40% is too damaged to resell. How can the problem be addressed?</p>

      <p>Borders may be invisible to most shoppers, but for businesses, they often mean delays, extra costs, and reams of paperwork. And amid Trump’s trade war, global trade is now faster and more complex than ever. Those new pressures have sparked a boom in new "customs tech" companies promising to speed things up.

      <h1>Why have some prices stayed put?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-10)
      <p>
      <p>Consumer prices have been overall slow to reflect the Trump administration’s new tariffs. So we called up some retailers to understand why they haven’t raised their prices, even though their costs are higher. It turns out, bumping up prices isn’t as easy as pushing a button — and can come with consequences. Also in this episode: Bond yields tell us where the economy’s headed, volatile categories can have an outsize impact on the PPI, and a new book investigates the “double tax” Black women face.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

(date: 2025-09-10)
      <p>
      <p>Wealthier foreigners are driving up rental prices and driving out long-term residents in Mexico City. There have been demonstrations there this summer, with some protesters damaging shops and restaurants that cater to tourists. In the popular neighborhood of La Condesa, activists say that as many as one in five homes is now for shorter-term rentals. We'll hear how residents are feeling and learn how the government is responding. But first: good news on wholesale inflation.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction barring President Donald Trump from ousting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, which means she can stay in her job while she fights her dismissal. The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services. Why is that not the case with electricity providers?</p>
