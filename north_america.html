<h2 id="trump-wants-to-eliminate-daylight-saving-time-in-us">Trump wants
to eliminate daylight saving time in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump wants to turn the lights out
on daylight saving time. </p>
<p>In a post on his social media site Friday, Trump said his party would
try to end the practice when he returns to office. </p>
<p>“The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight
Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t!
Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation,” he
wrote. </p>
<p>Setting clocks forward one hour in the spring and back an hour in the
fall is intended to maximize daylight during summer months but has long
been subject to scrutiny. Daylight saving time was first adopted as a
wartime measure in 1942. </p>
<p>Lawmakers have occasionally proposed getting rid of the time change
altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan
bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, had proposed making daylight
saving time permanent. </p>
<p>The measure was sponsored by Florida Senator Marco Rubio, whom Trump
has tapped to helm the State Department. </p>
<p>“Changing the clock twice a year is outdated and unnecessary,”
Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said as the Senate voted in
favor of the measure. </p>
<p>Health experts have said that lawmakers have it backward and that
standard time should be made permanent. </p>
<p>Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and
American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said that it’s time to do away
with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better
with the sun — and human biology. </p>
<p>Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that
do, the date that clocks are changed varies, creating a complicated
tapestry of changing time differences. </p>
<p>The U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii don’t change their clocks at
all.</p>

are loved,’ Jill Biden tells military children at toy drive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Less than 10 minutes was all it took for a large pile of
toys donated by the White House staff to disappear as Jill Biden and
children from military families sorted them into boxes as part of the
annual Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots campaign for the less
fortunate.</p>
<p>The White House is a longtime supporter of the program, which has
been helping families for 77 years, said Lieutenant General Leonard
Anderson IV, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
<p>“We’re making a significant impact right here in the nation’s
capital, where these toys will go to kids in need,” he said at a White
House event hosted by the first lady.</p>
<p>Last year, the program delivered over 25 million toys to more than 10
million children nationwide, he said. “This year we think we’re going to
set another record, so we’re really excited,” he said.</p>
<p>Jill Biden, whose father and late son served in the military, spoke
with  several dozen military children who sat in front of her on the
floor of the East Room facing two large glittering Christmas trees
flanking the doorway.</p>
<p>“If you only remember one thing for the holidays, after all the
wrapping paper is cleaned up, let it be this: You are loved,” she said.
“There are so many people who care about you, from your family and your
friends, from your teachers and your classmates, to the president and
me.</p>
<p>“And the best thing that we can do with that love is to let it
overflow, to share it with others who might really need it,” she
added.</p>
<p>After her brief remarks, the first lady asked the children: “Are you
guys ready to get sorting?” And off they went toward the large pile of
dolls, stuffed animals, sports gear, vehicles, books, puzzles and other
items, including a copy of “Delaware Opoly” — a Monopoly-style board
game themed after President Joe Biden’s home state.</p>

<h2 id="why-utah-is-at-the-epicenter-of-americas-land-use-fights">Why
Utah Is at the Epicenter of America’s Land Use Fights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI5MDI4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjU4NTM4OH0.AGReYjNHQfrKAf6GJpO20nlHuyRwibhCsI66aHcI8KE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Every state would like to think itself singular but, truly, there is no
place like Utah. The Beehive State has long fascinated outsiders; today,
that attention is largely trained on Netflix exposés about the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ballerina farmers, and Crumbl
cookies, but historically, the obsession has been with its land. Utah
has the nation’s highest density of National Parks; its rivers, canyons,
mountains, and deserts have stirred Mark Twain, John Wesley Powell, John
Muir, and Edward Abbey. To
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/post-malone-confessions-of-a-hip-hop-rock-star-116218/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quote</u></a>
a more contemporary literary conduit, Post Malone: “It’s a free country
out there. You can buy suppressors in Utah. You can … walk into the
grocery store with a handgun on your hip. Cowboy shit.”
</p>
<p>
More recently, Utah has sought out a different source of outsider
attention — that of the United States Supreme Court. Two lawsuits that
originated in the state are currently under consideration by the
justices. The first, <em><em>Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v.
Eagle County, Colorado</em></em>, concerns the scope of the National
Environmental Policy Act with regard to the construction of a railroad
spur that would link Utah’s oil fields to the national rail lines.
(Though the tracks would be in Utah, the connection would ultimately
<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/09/utah-colorado-oil-train-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase</u></a>
hazardous waxy crude oil shipments through the Colorado county in the
case citation.) The second lawsuit, <em><em>Utah v. the United
States</em></em> — which the court has yet to decide whether or not it
will hear — involves the state suing the federal government over its
allegedly unconstitutional control of “unused” lands by the Bureau of
Land Management. If Utah prevails in the case, it could mean the vast
reshaping of the American West, about 47% of which is federal land.
</p>
<p>
“Utah is all crazy, all the time right now,” Stephen Bloch, the legal
director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a conservation
nonprofit opposing <em><em>Utah v. the U.S.</em></em>, told me.
</p>
<p>
While not immediately apparent, there is nevertheless a strange logic to
the two lawsuits that otherwise appear to have little to do with one
another beyond the fact of their geography. At their core, both cases
are ultimately about <em><em>who </em></em>gets to decide to do
<em><em>what </em></em>with Utah’s land.
</p>
<p>
To anyone familiar with land use issues in the Mountain West, all of
this is fairly routine. A strain of libertarianism and anti-government
individualism runs through the more conservative inland Western states,
coloring everything from the gun ownership policies so colorfully
observed by Post Malone to whom the states back for president. Yet in
the extent to which it is willing to pursue this common ideal, Utah is
still an outlier.
</p>
<p>
“Westerners <em><em>revere</em></em> their public lands,” Betsy Gaines
Quammen, a historian and author of
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781948814140" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>American
Zion: Cliven Bundy, God &amp; Public Lands in the
West</em></em></u></a>, told me. “This is what makes the West the West —
that you can come out and just go hiking, and you’re not trespassing.”
Take the recent Montana Senate race, in which incumbent Democrat Jon
Tester wielded his opponent Tim Sheehy’s
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/29/jon-tester/in-montana-senate-race-public-lands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comparatively
mild</u></a> comments about privatizing public lands
<a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/in-final-days-of-election-tester-hammers-sheehy-on-public-lands-at-bozeman-event/article_64b2954a-955a-11ef-a820-97c3b1e1da1e.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
a cudgel</u></a> in a deep red state. (Tester, it must be added, lost
his reelection bid.) But in Utah, instead of celebrating federal land as
the embodiment of this Western inheritance, its politicians are trying
to eliminate them.
</p>
<p>
In the case of <em><em>Utah</em></em>, this goal is immediate and
obvious. State officials claim that the 18.5 million acres of
“unappropriated” BLM land in the state — that is, public lands not
already designated as national parks, monuments, wilderness areas,
national forests and conservation areas, or Tribal lands — are held in
violation of the U.S. Constitution, which
<a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Press-Release_-Utah-files-landmark-lawsuit-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>doesn’t
explicitly authorize</u></a> the federal government to hold land
indefinitely. “Utah deserves priority when it comes to managing this
land,” the state’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox
<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2024/08/20/utah-sues-over-federal-ownership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
at a news conference in August, adding, “Utah is in the best position to
understand and respond to the unique needs of our environment and
communities.”
</p>
<p>
While Utah’s crown jewel, its “Mighty Five” National Parks, would remain
under federal management, the state of Wyoming — which has backed Utah’s
lawsuit in an amicus brief along with Idaho, Alaska, and the Arizona
legislature —
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O160/328964/20241022142509821_UT%20v.%20US%20Wyo.%20Leg.%20AC.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wants
even more</u></a>. “In Wyoming’s filing, they’re like, ’Oh no, we’re in
for <em><em>everything</em></em>,” Bloch said. “‘There shouldn’t be
<em><em>any</em></em> federal land in Wyoming’ — including national
parks.” More than 95% of Yellowstone National Park — the nation’s
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
national park</u></a>, designated in 1872 — sits within Wyoming’s
borders.
</p>
<p>
It seems doubtful that the Supreme Court will take up this case. For one
thing, Utah is attempting to leapfrog the lower courts by taking its
complaints directly to SCOTUS, a shortcut it says is
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O160/322867/20240820100439497_Utah%20Bill%20of%20Complaint%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>justified
by</u></a> its concerns being “of profound importance not just to Utah,
but to all the States in the Nation.” For another, President Biden’s
Department of Justice has
<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2024/12/02/utah-public-lands-lawsuit-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
out</u></a> that what Utah seeks is outside the powers vested in the
judicial branch; only Congress has decision-making authority over public
lands. On the other hand, “Anyone right now, I think, would hesitate to
say definitively, ‘Here’s what the Supreme Court will do,’” Aaron Weiss,
the deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan
conservation advocacy group, told me.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Seven County Infrastructure Coalition </em></em>is a different
story. Opponents of the railway claim that the government’s
environmental review took into account the remote economic benefits of
the railway — including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct,_indirect,_and_induced_employment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>induced
employment</u></a>, a notoriously inexact projection — while not equally
weighing the indirect health impacts of the rail line, such as the
pollution of additional fracking wells in the Uinta Basin or frontline
communities near the refineries on the Gulf, where the crude oil is
ultimately headed. The Supreme Court (minus Neil Gorsuch, who
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/us/politics/justice-gorsuch-recusal-philip-anschutz.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recused</u></a>
himself at the 11th hour) heard oral arguments in the case this week,
however, and
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/supreme-court-seeks-middle-ground-on-nepa-limits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>appears
on track</u></a> to rule that the government’s NEPA review for the
railroad was sufficient. That would ultimately be a win for the Uinta
Basin Railway and the business coalition that brought the suit after the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled there
were flaws in the upstream and downstream analyses.
</p>
<p>
“I’m really worried that the court could end up inadvertently blessing
this fundamentally arbitrary, imbalanced result, where an agency is
allowed to talk about all the indirect benefits that they want — to go
as far down the line, as far upstream, to the ends of the Earth chasing
these indirect benefits — but not bother talking about the corresponding
costs,” Jason Schwartz, the legal director at the Institute for Policy
Integrity at New York University’s School of Law, told me. “That
undermines the very purpose of NEPA, which was to present the public and
decision-makers with a full and balanced view of both the economic and
environmental perspectives.” (Schwartz authored an amicus brief for the
Institute of Policy Integrity against the government’s NEPA review.)
</p>
<p>
A ruling that reaffirms the current scope of NEPA wouldn’t be a shock —
the court has always sided with the government in such cases,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/supreme-court-seeks-middle-ground-on-nepa-limits/#:~:text=in%20which%20the%20high%20court%20has%20always%20sided%20with%20the%20government%2C%20often%20by%20a%20unanimous%20vote." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>E&amp;E
News</em></em></u><u> notes</u></a>. What’s different this time is that
the plaintiffs presented the court with a third option, an avenue that
would
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/12/11/supreme-court-offers-clues-on-new-nepa-test-ew-00193600" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>severely
limit the scope</u></a> of the NEPA’s environmental review process going
forward by restraining agency considerations
<a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/reasonably-foreseeable-effects-seven-county-infrastructure-coalition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only
to what falls under</u></a> their immediate purview. Chief Justice John
Roberts has
<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/11/supreme-court-colorado-challenge-utah-oil-railroad/#:~:text=Most%20controversially%2C%20the%20argument%20put,law%20relating%20to%20legal%20liability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sounded
skeptical</u></a> of this pitch so far; it’s this third path, however,
that the oil and gas producer Anschutz submitted an amicus brief to the
court to support, drawing attention to the fact that “far more is at
stake … than the 88-mile rail line in rural Utah.” (The company’s owner,
Philip Anchutz, has close ties to Gorsuch.)
</p>
<p>
“There are so many ways to make NEPA more efficient without arbitrarily
decreasing the sometimes crucial information related to indirect effects
that NEPA currently provides,” Schwartz told me. Sam Sankar, the senior
vice president for programs at Earthjustice, which is supporting the
defense, added to me that his read on <em><em>Seven County
Infrastructure Coalition </em></em>case is that it proves how this
Supreme Court has “a pretty aggressive deregulatory, anti-environmental
agenda.” The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition told Heatmap in a
statement that with regards to the railroad, “we remain committed to
advancing this critical infrastructure, which aims to unlock economic
opportunities and support the region’s long-term development,” but that
it could not comment further as the case remains under deliberation.
</p>
<p>
A threat to NEPA is also a challenge to who gets a say in what Utah does
with its land, of course. Like <em><em>Utah v. the U.S.</em></em>, the
filing for <em><em>Seven County Infrastructure Coalition
</em></em>bristles with indignation over the government’s determinations
about how things should be done or what impacts should be considered,
even if the Surface Transportation Board ultimately gave the railroad
the green light. <em><em>Utah</em></em>, meanwhile, originated as a
reaction to the BLM’s
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/public-lands-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Public
Lands Rule</u></a>, in which the agency considers conservation as a land
use on equal footing with those of energy development, mining, or
grazing. (Specifically, Utah lawmakers were
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=127&v=UPSbpEYaZiQ&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fstandforourland.utah.gov%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>furious</u></a>
about the BLM closing some roads to motorized vehicles. “That’s
something that Utah gets very worked up about,” Bloch, the legal
director at SUWA, told me.)
</p>
<p>
There is always a risk of overascribing the state of Utah’s otherwise
seemingly inexplicable actions to Mormonism — a religion that is far
from monolithic and is often the subject of derision from outsiders. But
Quammen, the historian, told me that you can’t separate today’s public
land policies from the cultural and theological inheritances and beliefs
reinforced over generations of Mormon tradition. “A lot of the people
taking these stands [over public lands] come from families that have
been in that area for generations, so they have stories and ideologies
that have been passed down — as has their relationship with the land,”
Quammen explained.
</p>
<p>
Weiss, of Western Priorities, concurred. “There are some folks in Utah
who truly believe that this land belongs to them,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Quammen noted by way of example that Cliven Bundy, who led a standoff at
the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016 over the demand
that the BLM cede its land to the states, told her his legal right to
the public lands where he grazes his cattle in Nevada started when his
ancestor’s horse drank from its
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/bundy-ranch-standoff-nevada-cattle-ffff74b4e3224fb596e6bb735cedef98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Virgin
River</u></a> — although in fact it was a Southern Paiute river before
that. (That’s not the only historically inaccurate ownership claim that
might be at play in Utah; Bloch of SUWA noted that the lands within the
exterior boundaries of the state were ceded to the federal government in
1848 through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the end of the
U.S.-Mexico War, and in that sense, “they’ve never been ‘Utah lands’ so
there’s nothing to ‘give back’ to Utah.”)
</p>
<p>
Preservationists and conservationists during the settlement era saw
Utah’s landscape as untrammeled (“also not true, because it was
Indigenous land,” Quammen added) and in need of protection, but early
church belief viewed it differently. “They thought that the land being
utilized, built, and made productive was pleasing to the eye of God,”
Quammen said. Finally, Joseph Smith, the founder of LDS,
<a href="https://latterdayconservative.com/quote/teachings-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith-326-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emphasized
the importance</u></a> of his adherents understanding the U.S.
Constitution inside and out. In the case of public lands disputes, this
resurfaces in the claim that the federal government can’t own land
indefinitely, Quammen told me. “That’s the piece about understanding the
Constitution better than constitutional scholars.” Ironically, it
disregards the <em><em>state’s </em></em>constitution, in which Utah
explicitly
<a href="https://archives.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/Enabling-Act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agreed</u></a>
in 1894 to “forever disclaim[s] all right and title to the
unappropriated public lands” in order to be granted statehood.
</p>
<p>
There is, of course, a significant small-government push in the
Republican Party, too; privatizing land was part of the party’s
presidential platform this year. It can be hard to tell, however, where
one influence ends and another begins: William Perry Pendley, a key
figure in the Reagan administration during the Sagebrush Rebellion fight
over public lands in the 1970s and 1980s, authored the Project 2025
chapter on the Department of the Interior. Doug Burgum, Trump’s nominee
for the head of the department, recently met with Utah’s Republican
Senator Mike Lee, a devout Latter-Day Saint, who afterward
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/senmikelee/p/DDaLIB4S9Jm/?img_index=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted</u></a>,
“Great meeting with <span class="citation"
data-cites="dougburgum">@dougburgum</span> and planning the return of
American lands to the American people.” And if Trump attempts to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-legacy-30x30" target="_self"><u>walk
back protections</u></a> of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante
National Monuments again, that land would be added to the pot of what
Utah is seeking to acquire.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>Utah</em></em>’s organizers seem prepared to make an appeal to
Congress or the Trump administration if the Supreme Court doesn’t make a
move in their favor; funding for the messaging for
<a href="https://standforourland.utah.gov/#press" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stand
for Our Land</u></a>, the publicity arm of the lawsuit, has reportedly
outpaced the spending on lawyers. (A request for comment to the Utah
Attorney General’s Office and Gov. Spencer J. Cox went unanswered.)
</p>
<p>
The implications of the Supreme Court’s decisions on limiting the scope
of NEPA or hearing the public lands lawsuit are vast in both cases. The
former could ease the way for expansive oil and gas development in Utah,
which would be “a bona fide public health nightmare,” according to Brian
Moench, an anesthesiologist on the board of Utah Physicians for a
Healthy Environment, which is opposing the railroad, due to
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/whats-killing-the-babies-of-vernal-utah-33666/#ixzz3ePygcCH6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>all
the additional pollution</u></a>. “If they’re allowed to do this and
increase the oil and gas drilling production by 500% — I don’t know what
you would call the end result. Unlivable, as far as I’m concerned.”
</p>
<p>
In the case of the public lands, meanwhile, “I think [Utah is] trying to
give the impression that these are scrubby lands that nobody cares about
when, in fact, it concerns landscapes like Labyrinth Canyon or the Dirty
Devil or the Fisher Towers — these very iconic red rock landscapes that
Americans think about when they think about visiting the state,” Bloch
told me. “<em><em>Those</em></em> are the types of places in the
crosshairs with this lawsuit.”
</p>
<p>
Ironically, it’s doubtful that a transfer of public lands would even
benefit most Utahns. Because states can’t run deficits, a disaster like
a bad wildfire would
<a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/investigations/oregon-department-forestry-wildfire-season-cost-expense-funding-firefighting/283-3762c6e4-0c94-4dfe-90e0-dc5678d920bd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drain
the Utah budget</u></a>. Additionally, ranchers would pay far more for
grazing their cattle on state lands
(<a href="https://www.blm.gov/policy/im2024-017#:~:text=The%20fee%20for%20livestock%20grazing,animal%20unit%20month%20(AUM)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
high as $19.50 per animal unit per month</u></a>, per the BLM) than on
federal lands, where the fee is a dirt-cheap $1.35. Ultimately, the
state likely wouldn’t even possess much of the land it claims to want so
badly.
</p>
<p>
Utah’s politicians “would much prefer to be able to sell off any lands
that they want — whether it’s for oil and gas leasing, whether it’s for
mansions near national parks. This is very valuable land and a very
valuable resource that belongs to all Americans,” Weiss of Western
Priorities said. “And Utah would prefer if it belonged to them.”
</p>
<p>
Public lands and pride in the natural environment are fundamental to
many Westerners’ beliefs and identities. By that token, it would seem
Utah has made a miscalculation that only an insider could truly
appreciate the cost of; by taking over control of portions of its
territory from the federal government, it would be, in effect, boxing
Utahns out of their own lands —a craven, modern twist if ever there was
one.
</p>
<p>
But to be able to hike or hunt, to pitch a tent, to fish, to stargaze,
to graze one’s cattle on nearly 70% of the land in Utah, because it
belongs to us, the public?
</p>
<p>
Now <em><em>that’s</em></em> cowboy shit.

Russian: Sister of American jailed in Russia says she doesn’t know where
he is</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Patricia Hubbard Fox, the sister of the 72-year-old U.S. citizen
Stephen Hubbard sentenced to jail in Russia for almost seven years on
charges of “being a mercenary” for his alleged participation in fighting
in Ukraine, says in an exclusive VOA Russian interview that she is still
unsuccessfully trying to find out the location of his prison in Russia.
She refuted the charges against her brother, saying that he would not be
able to fight alongside the Ukrainian army and that he was an English
language teacher in a small Ukrainian town.</p>

Persian exclusive: Trump’s team says all options on the table with

<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team told VOA Persian
on Friday that all options remain on the table when it comes to
addressing Iran’s nuclear program.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration is committed to reestablishing peace and
stability in the Middle East,” Brian Hughes, spokesperson for Trump’s
transition team, said in an email, responding to an inquiry made by VOA
Persian regarding a Friday Wall Street Journal report suggesting that
the Trump administration is considering military options to curb Iran’s
nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>“President Trump will keep all options on the table as it relates to
the Iran Regime, including Maximum Pressure,” Hughes said.</p>

<h2 id="ukraine-syria-key-focus-of-biden-talks-with-g7">Ukraine, Syria
key focus of Biden talks with G7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden met virtually with G7 leaders
Friday to secure support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion,
less than six weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, a skeptic of
aid to Ukraine, is set to take office.</p>
<p>The talks followed Washington’s $20 billion disbursement earlier this
week to a new World Bank fund that will provide economic support for
Ukraine. The money is part of a new $50 billion loan for Kyiv from the
Group of Seven democracies that will be paid back with interest income
earned from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in G7 countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Biden approved a new security assistance package
for Ukraine that will provide Kyiv with additional air defense,
artillery, drones and armored vehicles — the 72nd such drawdown package
announced by Washington since Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“As the president made clear, we’re going to continue to provide
additional packages right up until the end of this administration,”
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said during a news
briefing Thursday.</p>
<p>On January 20, Biden will hand over power to Trump, who has been
critical of using American taxpayers’ money to help Kyiv. Without
providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war — a
statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to
capitulate.</p>
<p>“We are likely to see the G7 redouble support for Ukraine in part
because of concerns that President Trump may reduce support,” said
William Courtney, adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corp, to VOA in an
interview.</p>
<p>Additional sanctions on Russia appear to be in the works, Courtney
told VOA.</p>
<p>Syria aftermath</p>
<p>G7 leaders also focused on fast-moving events related to the
momentous transition of power in Syria following the ouster of President
Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>On Thursday , the leaders said in a statement they “stand ready to
support a transition process that leads to credible, inclusive and
nonsectarian governance” in Syria.</p>
<p>Support for the new government is conditional upon “respect for the
rule of law, universal human rights, including women’s rights, the
protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic minorities,
transparency and accountability,” the leaders’ statement said.</p>
<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that toppled Assad, is a
U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. Its leader, Abu Mohammed
al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head. The U.S. and other G7
countries have signaled that HTS’ delisting from their terror list would
be dependent upon how inclusive the new government would be.</p>
<p>In recent years, Jolani has distanced himself from extremist
ideology. Since the rebels’ victory, he has sought to assure his
nonsectarian stance to Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, which
include Christians, Kurds, Druze and the Alawite community, a sect from
which the Assad family originates.</p>
<p>Trump has also signaled that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the
Syrian conflict. “This is not our fight,” Trump said on social media in
response to Assad’s ouster. “Let it play out. Do not get involved!”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether a new U.S. administration would be able to
maintain a hands-off approach that Trump said he wants. There are
approximately 900 American troops stationed in Syria, and Washington has
close ties with all of Syria’s neighbors, including allies Turkey and
Israel. Both are already making military maneuvers to secure their
interests.</p>
<p>Two days after the Syrian rebels took control of Damascus on December
8, Israel launched airstrikes across the country, further weakening what
remains of the Assad regime’s military, once a stalwart ally of Israel’s
archnemesis, Iran. Since then, Israeli troops have advanced deeper into
the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone separating the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights and Syrian territory.</p>
<p>The United Nations said Israel’s actions violate the country’s 1974
Disengagement Agreement with Syria. The U.S. said it is in line with
Israel’s right to self-defense, to avoid weapons falling into
extremists’ hands amid a vacuum in power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syrian Kurds near the northern border with Turkey have
been displaced amid clashes between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and
Ankara-backed rebels. The U.S. brokered a ceasefire deal between the
groups on Wednesday but it is unclear whether the fragile truce will
hold.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser
Jake Sullivan are currently in the region for talks, hoping to ensure a
smooth transition in Damascus and making a last-ditch diplomatic push to
achieve a deal to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Iraq on Friday
after Syria-focused talks with his counterpart in Turkey.</p>
<p>Blinken met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in
Baghdad, after flying from Ankara on a C-17 U.S. Air Force plane.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken
“underscored the U.S. commitment to the U.S.-Iraq strategic partnership
and to Iraq’s security, stability and sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“The secretary reaffirmed the United States’ support for a Syrian-led
political process resulting in an inclusive and representative civilian
government,” said Miller in a statement. “He emphasized that the
transition process and resulting government must uphold clear
commitments to respect the human rights of the Syrian people, including
women and members of minority communities, and all of Syria’s religious
and holy sites.”</p>
<p>During talks with Iraq’s prime minister, Blinken also “emphasized the
need to facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, and to prevent
Syria from being used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its
neighbors.”</p>
<p>The two also discussed “continuing efforts to prevent ISIS from
resurging and destabilizing the broader region.” ISIS is an acronym for
the Islamic State terror group.</p>
<p>Talks in Turkey</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, the secretary of state met with Turkish Foreign
Minister Hakan Fidan in Turkey’s capital, where Blinken called for an
interim Syrian government “that is inclusive and nonsectarian, one that
protects the rights of minorities and women, one that preserves
institutions of the state and delivers services to the people.”</p>
<p>Blinken said both countries would like to see the interim Syrian
government find and appropriately destroy chemical weapons left over
from former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. He said he does
not want Syria to pose a threat to its neighbors and wants the interim
leadership to reject any alliances with extremist groups, particularly
Islamic State.</p>
<p>“Our countries worked very hard and gave a lot over many years to
ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate,” Blinken said. He
added there is “a basis to ensure that that threat doesn’t rear its head
again. And it’s imperative that we keep at it, keep up those
efforts.”</p>
<p>Blinken met with Fidan on the second leg of his Middle East tour,
which was triggered by the ouster of Assad’s regime in a lightning
offensive spearheaded by Islamist-led HTS rebels, ending 54 years of the
Assad family’s repressive rule.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the secretary of state met with Turkish President Recep
Erdogan. Blinken was also in Jordan Thursday where he met with King
Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein and Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi.</p>
<p>He told reporters following those talks in Aqaba, Jordan, that the
sides are working to coordinate regional efforts “to support the Syrian
people as they transition away from Assad’s brutal dictatorship.”</p>
<p>American rescued</p>
<p>Blinken also discussed 29–year-old Travis Timmerman, a missing
American who turned up in Syria Thursday. Timmerman was among thousands
of people released by rebels from Syria’s notorious prisons last weekend
as the rebels swept toward the capital, Damascus, and overthrew
Assad.</p>
<p>Timmerman was initially mistaken by some for Austin Tice, an American
journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago and has yet to be
found after the rebel takeover and Assad’s flight to asylum in
Russia.</p>
<p>In a video, Timmerman was seen lying on a mattress under a blanket in
what appeared to be a private house. A group of men in the video said
that he was being treated well and would be safely returned home. It was
not immediately clear where Timmerman had been held.</p>
<p>Blinken told reporters U.S. officials were working to confirm
Timmerman’s identity and provide him support. He said the White House
was “working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria” but declined
further comment for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>“I can’t give you any details on exactly what’s going to happen,” he
said.</p>
<p>In a later interview with the Al-Arabiya TV network, Timmerman said
he had illegally crossed into Syria on foot from the eastern Lebanese
town of Zahle before being detained and held in a cell alone.</p>
<p>Timmerman, who said he had been trying to make a Christian
pilgrimage, said he had been treated well but could hear other young men
being tortured.</p>
<p>“It was OK. I was fed. I was watered. The one difficulty was that I
couldn’t go to the bathroom when I wanted to,” he said. Timmerman said
he was allowed to go only three times a day.</p>
<p>“I was not beaten and the guards treated me decently,” he said.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press,
Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="us-china-sign-5-year-amended-agreement-on-science-and-technology-cooperation">US,
China sign 5-year amended agreement on science and technology
cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — The United States and China Friday signed a
protocol to amend the bilateral, government-to-government Science and
Technology Agreement and extend it for five years, according to the
State Department. </p>
<p>The STA, first signed in 1979 by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is aimed at facilitating cooperation in
areas such as agriculture, energy, space, health, environment, earth
sciences, engineering, and educational and scholarly exchanges. </p>
<p>The amended agreement, which U.S. officials said excludes “critical
or emerging technologies,” took effect retroactively as of August 27 for
a five-year term and was signed in Beijing by representatives from both
countries. A senior State Department official told reporters the new
agreement narrows the scope of the previous deal and introduces
“guardrails” to ensure “reciprocity, transparency and openness.” </p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters
in February that the nature of scientific and technological exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries is “mutually beneficial and a
win-win.” </p>
<p>U.S.-China science and technology cooperation has faced criticism and
raised security concerns over the years, with critics arguing it could
bolster Beijing’s military capabilities. </p>
<p>Since its inception, the STA has been renewed approximately every
five years. In August 2023, it was granted a six-month extension, which
was followed by another in February 2024, to maintain the agreement
while the U.S. negotiated an amended deal. The short-term extensions
occurred amid scrutiny from several members of Congress, who argued
China had previously exploited the agreement to advance military
objectives against the U.S. </p>
<p>In June 2023, Republican Representative Elise Stefanik, who is
President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for U.N. ambassador, and other
lawmakers wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging him not to
renew the STA when it was set to expire on August 27, 2023. They cited
concerns over joint research projects between the U.S. Agriculture
Department and Chinese entities, including concerns over such dual-use
technologies as those used to analyze drone imagery for irrigation
management. </p>
<p>Covers basic research </p>
<p>The amended agreement focuses on basic research in fields such as
weather, oceanography and geology. It supports U.S. scientific agencies
with research related to tsunami warnings, influenza data, air quality
monitoring, agriculture, and pest management, according to the State
Department. </p>
<p>Another senior State Department official said the amended STA
framework enables agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the departments of Energy and Agriculture to propose
cooperation and set up data-sharing agreements and joint research
projects with their Chinese counterparts.  </p>
<p>The State Department reviews proposed collaborations, which also
undergo a broader interagency review process led by the White House.
Once vetted, the proposals can be implemented. </p>
<p>If either party fails to adhere to the agreed terms, a dispute
resolution mechanism is triggered. Additionally, a termination clause
allows cancellation of proposed projects in the case of “bad faith
action.” </p>
<p>The amended agreement “sustains intellectual property protections and
establishes new guardrails for implementing agencies to protect the
safety and security of their researchers,” according to a State
Department statement. </p>
<p>Security concerns </p>
<p>However, concerns persist regarding China’s stricter data
localization and privacy laws, which raise legal risks for U.S.
researchers handling Chinese data. The new STA has yet to clarify the
protections available for U.S. researchers who may use or transfer
Chinese data outside of China. </p>
<p>Congressional critics, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio,
Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, have been outspoken opponents of
renewing U.S.-China science and technology cooperation.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Rubio called for stronger measures to safeguard
the security of U.S. scientific research. He also introduced a bill to
underscore the risks posed by problematic research collaborations with
Chinese-linked entities.</p>

<h2 id="us-charges-ex-head-of-syrian-prison-with-torture">US charges
ex-head of Syrian prison with torture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The former head of a notorious Syrian prison was
charged Thursday in the United States with torturing opponents of the
now-collapsed government of Bashar al-Assad, the Justice Department
said.</p>
<p>Samir Ousman Alsheikh, 72, who has been in the U.S. since 2020,
allegedly ran Damascus Central Prison – known colloquially as Adra
Prison – from approximately 2005 to 2008, where detainees were subjected
to horrific abuse in the “Punishment Wing.”</p>
<p>The charges come days after Assad fled the country as his government
crumbled, and as millions of Syrians begin a reckoning with decades of
repression.</p>
<p>Alsheikh personally inflicted severe physical and mental pain on
detainees, as well as ordering his staff to carry out such acts, U.S.
prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Under Alsheikh, prisoners were beaten while hung from the ceiling or
subjected to a device known as the “Flying Carpet,” which folded their
bodies in half at the waist, causing excruciating pain and sometimes
resulting in fractured spines.</p>
<p>“We are one step closer to holding him accountable for those heinous
crimes. The United States will never be a safe haven for those who
commit human rights abuses abroad,” said Eddy Wang, special agent in
charge of the Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles field
office.</p>
<p>Alsheikh faces three counts of torture and one count of conspiracy to
commit torture. He was arrested in July at the Los Angeles airport on
separate immigration fraud charges.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years for each of the
torture charges.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said Alsheikh held a variety of positions in
the Syrian police and the Syrian state security apparatus.</p>
<p>He was also associated with the Syrian Ba’ath Party that ruled the
country and had been appointed governor of the province of Deir Ez-Zour
by Assad in 2011.</p>
<p>He moved to the United States in 2020 and applied for citizenship in
2023.</p>
<p>A simmering civil war in Syria erupted late last month with a
lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham
(HTS) group and its allies.</p>
<p>After racing through several major cities, the rebels quickly swept
Damascus, sending Assad fleeing to Russia and bringing a sudden end to
five decades of repressive rule by his clan.</p>
<p>Syrians have since flocked to prisons searching for missing loved
ones.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people died of torture or as a result of the
conditions of their detention in prisons under Assad’s rule since the
civil war erupted in 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human
Rights.</p>

id="american-imprisoned-in-assads-syria-calls-his-release-from-prison-a-blessing">American
imprisoned in Assad’s Syria calls his release from prison a
‘blessing’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DAMASCUS, SYRIA — An American who disappeared seven months ago into
former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s notorious prison system said
early Friday he was released by the “liberators” who arrived in Damascus
a day after the longtime ruler fled the capital.</p>
<p>Travis Timmerman called his release a “blessing” when he spoke to The
Associated Press from a hotel room in Damascus, where he arrived late
Thursday. He was among the thousands of people released from Syria’s
sprawling military prisons this week after rebels reached Damascus,
overthrowing Assad and ending his family’s 54-year rule.</p>
<p>Timmerman, 29, said he had gone to Syria on a Christian pilgrimage
and was not ill-treated while in Palestine Branch, a notorious detention
facility operated by Syrian intelligence. He said he was freed by “the
liberators who came into the prison and knocked the door down (of his
cell) with a hammer.”</p>
<p>The political affairs office of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham, the rebel group that led the lightning offensive to topple
Assad’s government, said the group had secured his release.</p>
<p>“We affirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the U.S.
administration to complete the search for American citizens disappeared
by the former Assad regime,” the group said, adding that a search was
under way for Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in
Syria 12 years ago. An official with the group later said it was
arranging for Timmerman to leave Syria, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Timmerman said he was released Monday morning alongside a young
Syrian man and 70 female prisoners, some of whom had their children with
them.</p>
<p>He had been held separately from Syrian and other Arab prisoners and
said he didn’t know of any other Americans held in the facility.</p>
<p>“I was there seven months. There were women there up above me,”
Timmerman said. He heard the women singing and teaching their children
and could hear some of the men being beaten regularly. “I was never
beaten,” he said.</p>
<p>He was detained after he crossed into Syria from a mountain along the
eastern Lebanese town of Zahle in June. He was questioned for three and
half hours by interrogators who thought he must be a spy. In a brief
second interview, they searched his mobile phone, and in the last
interview, he started discussing his dreams with his captors.</p>
<p>He said their threat of using violence against him was “implicit”
because he could hear daily beatings next door. But his captors let him
use his mobile to call his family three weeks ago. At the time,
Timmerman didn’t tell his family he was in Damascus, only that he was
fine.</p>
<p>He said later in his detention, he could hear explosions — at a time
when Israel was intensifying its strikes in Syria. Israel’s war with the
Hezbollah militant group had intensified in September, before a
ceasefire was reached last month.</p>
<p>“I heard some explosives that shook the building,” he said.</p>
<p>In his prison cell, Timmerman said he had a mattress, a plastic
drinking container and two others for waste. He had three bathroom
breaks and had exercise breaks in the first half of his stay.</p>
<p>He said the Friday calls to prayers helped keep track of days.</p>
<p>He said he gained weight at first because he ate unleavened bread,
rice and oats. Sometimes he would get a potato or a tomato — a treatment
clearly reserved for non-Syrian prisoners, who often ended up emaciated
or sick.</p>
<p>“It is a time of solace and you can meditate on your life,” he told
AP. “It was good for me.”</p>
<p>Timmerman was disheveled, with a scraggly beard and long hair and
nails. He said he had a good sleep and a meal on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said he planned to return to Damascus.</p>
<p>Timmerman is from Urbana, Missouri, about 80 kilometers north of
Springfield in the southwestern part of the state. He earned a finance
degree from Missouri State University in 2017.</p>
<p>Timmerman’s mother, Stacey Gardiner, told the AP that as of Thursday
evening, she hadn’t spoken to her son. She said he told her he was
visiting Prague and Budapest, Hungary, to “write about different
churches.” She said she last heard from him in May, when he said he was
going somewhere without internet and that he would call when he had
access again. Then he stopped replying to calls and texts and she didn’t
know whether he was alive or dead.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help him, and that broke my heart more and more each
day,” Gardiner said. “I just want my baby (to) come home.”</p>
<p>The family reported him missing, and the Missouri State Highway
Patrol issued a bulletin saying “Pete Timmerman” had gone missing in
Hungary in early June. In late August, Hungarian police put out a
missing persons announcement for “Travis Pete Timmerman,” saying he was
last seen at a church in Budapest. Timmerman goes by Travis.</p>
<p>In describing his release from prison, Timmerman said the action
outside his cell woke him up. Those who came to release him spoke to him
in Arabic. “It was an excited scene. It was not clear if the guards who
were there were still there,” Timmerman said. “I didn’t know if they
were taking us out in the midst of a war zone … in hindsight, this
shooting was not actual clashes.”</p>
<p>He said he was panicked for a moment. But he realized some of the
gunfire was celebratory from blanks. One man was shooting from an AK-47.
At one point, he went running back into the prison with two other
prisoners. A fellow prisoner helped him out, holding his arm, and
speaking Arabic to those around. They both accompanied a female prisoner
to her home.</p>
<p>He spent two nights in Damascus, one in abandoned apartment in the
old town and another at a new friend’s house.</p>
<p>He then started walking toward Jordan, when a Syrian family found him
barefoot on a main road in the countryside of Damascus early
Thursday.</p>
<p>At first some mistook him for Tice.</p>
<p>The Syrian family told AP that Timmerman appeared cold and hungry so
they brought him back to their home.</p>
<p>“I fed him and called a doctor,” said Mosaed al-Rifai, the
68-year-old waste collector who first found Timmerman.</p>
<p>A few hours after al-Rifai discovered him, rebels arrived at the
family’s house to pick him up, he said.</p>
<p>Mouaz Mostafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task
Force, a U.S.-based nonprofit group, who was in Damascus learned of
Timmerman’s location, reached him and contacted US authorities about
him.</p>
<p>Timmerman is now recovering until the rebels can figure out how to
hand him to U.S. authorities, Moustafa said.</p>
<p>From Aqaba, Jordan, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told
reporters that the White House was “working to bring him home, to bring
him out of Syria” but declined further comment for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>Washington’s top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, travelled to
Lebanon this week in hopes of collecting information on the whereabouts
of Tice.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has said his administration believed Tice was
alive and was committed to bringing him home, though he also
acknowledged on Sunday that “we have no direct evidence” of his status.
The case has frustrated U.S. intelligence officials for years.</p>
<p>“This is a priority for the United States,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Tice, who has had his work published by The Washington Post,
McClatchy newspapers and others, disappeared at a checkpoint in a
contested area west of Damascus in August 2012 as the Syrian civil war
intensified.</p>
<p>A video released weeks after Tice went missing showed him blindfolded
and held by armed men. He hasn’t been heard from since. Assad’s
government had denied that it was holding him.</p>

id="china-russia-arctic-cooperation-a-us-national-security-concern">China-Russia
Arctic cooperation a US national security concern</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The United States and its NATO allies are paying
increased attention to military cooperation between Russia and China in
the Arctic, where the two countries have conducted joint naval
exercises, coast guard patrols and strategic bomber air training.</p>
<p>That cooperation includes more closely coordinated military drills,
said Iris Ferguson, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for
Arctic and Global Resilience. She spoke during an online December 5
discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies.</p>
<p>“The increasing levels of collaboration between Russia and the PRC
[People’s Republic of China] and the unprecedented style of
collaboration, especially in the military domain, give us again pause,”
said Ferguson.</p>
<p>In October, the coast guards of China and Russia conducted their
first joint Arctic maritime patrol.</p>
<p>In July, four Russian and Chinese strategic bombers flew over the
Chukchi Sea and the Bering Sea, marking the first time their military
aircraft launched from the same airbase in northern Russia and the first
time Chinese bombers flew within the Alaskan Air Defense Identification
Zone.</p>
<p>China and Russia also held joint naval exercises in the Bering Strait
in 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>China has no Arctic territory of its own but is interested in growing
opportunities for mineral exploration and a shipping route to Europe as
climate change causes the Arctic ice cap to recede.</p>
<p>“It is an interesting development showing that a level of cooperation
that a few years ago we didn’t think will get to that level,” said
Stephanie Pezard, associate research department director at the RAND
Corporation, headquartered in Santa Monica, California.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense published a “2024 Arctic Strategy” in
July that identifies Chinese and Russian collaboration as a major
geopolitical challenge driving the need for a new strategic approach to
the Arctic.</p>
<p>Chang Ching, a senior researcher from the Society for Strategic
Studies based in Taipei, said China’s presence in the Arctic creates
pressure on the U.S. and other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).</p>
<p>“In the past, Russia was the only traditional adversary in the
Arctic, but now there is an additional challenge,” Chang told VOA
Mandarin this week.</p>
<p>No immediate threat</p>
<p>Other NATO members are responding to the increased military
activities of Russia and China in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Canada released a new Arctic Foreign Policy report December 6 to
address its growing military cooperation with other like-minded nations
in the region.</p>
<p>The report recommends that Canada strengthen diplomatic and
technological cooperation with NATO countries in the Arctic and
like-minded nations such as Japan and South Korea. It also emphasizes
enhancing Canada’s military presence in the Arctic. Canada’s Arctic
territory makes up about 40% of the country and more than 70% of its
coastline.</p>
<p>Canada, Finland, and the U.S. in November agreed to jointly build
icebreakers, ships to cut through frozen waters, a decision driven at
least in part by a desire to counter Russia’s influence in the
region.</p>
<p>Despite their stepped-up joint military activities in the Arctic,
analysts say China and Russia do not pose an immediate threat to the
U.S. and its partners in the region.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important to not overstate what the PRC is
getting from Russia as well,” Ferguson said. “We know what it takes to
operate with allies. We know the years of investment and trust building
and interoperability required to make an alliance, and you know their
flying in [a] circle together is not the same.”</p>
<p>Why is China in the Arctic?</p>
<p>China is a new player in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Beijing’s “Arctic Policy White Paper,” published in 2018, stated that
China’s polar strategy focuses on issues such as climate change,
environmental protection, scientific research, navigation routes,
resource exploration and development, security and international
governance.</p>
<p>“China will not and has no intention of using Arctic issues to
promote its geopolitical interests,” said the Chinese Embassy to VOA
Mandarin in an emailed response Wednesday to the comments made at the
online CSIS discussion.</p>
<p>“As a non-Arctic country, China is an active participant, builder and
contributor to Arctic affairs, contributing its wisdom and strength to
the change and development of the Arctic,” the embassy statement
said.</p>
<p>However, Yang Zhen and Ren Yanyan, researchers at the Shanghai
University of Political Science and Law, suggest that China-Russia naval
cooperation in the Arctic is a way to counterbalance what they call the
U.S.’s “maritime hegemony.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beijing and Moscow have been developing Arctic shipping
routes, especially for Russian oil and gas, as Western sanctions over
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have largely halted the trade with
Europe.</p>

Francisco names street for Associated Press Iwo Jima photographer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — A photojournalist who captured one of the most
enduring images of World War II — the U.S. Marines raising the flag on
the Japanese island of Iwo Jima — had a block in downtown San Francisco
named for him Thursday.</p>
<p>Joe Rosenthal, who died in 2006 at age 94, was working for The
Associated Press in 1945 when he took the Pulitzer Prize-winning
photo.</p>
<p>After the war, he went to work as a staff photographer for the San
Francisco Chronicle, and for 35 years until his retirement in 1981, he
captured moments of city life both extraordinary and routine.</p>
<p>Rosenthal photographed famous people for the paper, including a young
Willie Mays getting his hat fitted as a San Francisco Giant in 1957, and
regular people, including children making a joyous dash for freedom on
the last day of school in 1965.</p>
<p>The 600 block of Sutter Street, near downtown’s Union Square, became
Joe Rosenthal Way after a short ceremony Thursday morning. The Marines
Memorial Club, which sits on the block, welcomed the street’s new
name.</p>
<p>Aaron Peskin, who heads the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
welcomed the city’s political elite, military officials and members of
Rosenthal’s family to toast the late photographer, who was born in
Washington, D.C., to Russian Jewish immigrant parents.</p>
<p>The famous photo became the centerpiece of a war bonds poster that
helped raise $26 billion in 1945. Tom Graves, chapter historian for the
USMC Combat Correspondents Association, which pushed for the street
naming, said the image helped win the war.</p>
<p>“But I’ve grown over the years to appreciate also his role as a San
Francisco newspaper photographer who, as Supervisor Peskin says, went to
work every day photographing the city where we all live, we all love,”
he said.</p>
<p>Graves and others said they look forward to tourists and locals
happening upon the street sign, seeing Rosenthal’s name for perhaps the
first time, and then going online to learn about the photographer with
the terrible eyesight but an eye for composition.</p>
<p>Rosenthal never considered himself a wartime hero, just a working
photographer lucky enough to document the courage of soldiers.</p>
<p>When complimented on his Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, Rosenthal
said: “Sure, I took the photo. But the Marines took Iwo Jima.”</p>

automated systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his
support for the dockworkers union before their contract expires next
month at Eastern and Gulf Coast ports, saying that any further
“automation” of the ports would harm workers.</p>
<p>The incoming president posted on social media that he met Harold
Daggett, the president of the International Longshoreman’s Association,
and Dennis Daggett, the union’s executive vice president.</p>
<p>“I’ve studied automation, and know just about everything there is to
know about it,” Trump posted. “The amount of money saved is nowhere near
the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American Workers, in this
case, our Longshoremen. Foreign companies have made a fortune in the
U.S. by giving them access to our markets. They shouldn’t be looking for
every last penny knowing how many families are hurt.”</p>
<p>The International Longshoremen’s Association has until January 15 to
negotiate a new contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which
represents ports and shipping companies.</p>
<p>At the heart of the dispute is whether ports can install automated
gates, cranes and container-moving trucks that could make it faster to
unload and load ships. The union argues that automation would lead to
fewer jobs, even though higher levels of productivity could do more to
boost the salaries of remaining workers.</p>
<p>The Maritime Alliance said in a statement that the contract goes
beyond ports to “supporting American consumers and giving American
businesses access to the global marketplace – from farmers, to
manufacturers, to small businesses, and innovative start-ups looking for
new markets to sell their products.”</p>
<p>“To achieve this, we need modern technology that is proven to improve
worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and
strengthen our supply chains,” said the alliance, adding that it looks
forward to working with Trump.</p>
<p>In October, the union representing 45,000 dockworkers went on strike
for three days, raising the risk that a prolonged shutdown could push up
inflation by making it difficult to unload container ships and export
American products overseas.</p>
<p>The issue pits an incoming president who won November’s election on
the promise of bringing down prices against commitments to support
blue-collar workers along with the kinds of advanced technology that
drew him support from Silicon Valley elite such as billionaire Elon
Musk.</p>
<p>Trump sought to portray the dispute as being between U.S. workers and
foreign companies, but advanced ports are also key for staying globally
competitive. China is opening a $1.3 billion port in Peru that could
accommodate ships too large for the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>There is a risk that shippers could move to other ports, which could
also lead to job losses. Mexico is constructing a port that is highly
automated, while Dubai, Singapore and Rotterdam already have more
advanced ports.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump said that ports and shipping companies should eschew
“machinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be
replaced.”</p>
<p>“For the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign
companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying
them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,” Trump
posted. “It is time to put AMERICA FIRST!”</p>

announces new arms aid package for Ukraine worth $500 million</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced another package of
weapons aid for Ukraine on Thursday, valued at $500 million, Secretary
of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby said earlier the U.S. would
continue to provide additional packages for Ukraine “right up to the end
of this administration.”</p>
<p>Washington said 10 days ago it would send Ukraine $725 million worth
of missiles, ammunition, anti-personnel mines and other weapons.</p>
<p>Biden’s outgoing administration is seeking to bolster Ukraine in
tackling Russia’s invasion, before Biden’s term ends in January when
Republican President-elect Donald Trump would take office.</p>
<p>Thursday’s package worth about $500 million included ammunition for
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and High-speed
Anti-radiation missiles (HARMs), among other assistance, according to
Blinken.</p>
<p>After Thursday, about $5.6 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown
Authority (PDA) to rush weapons from U.S. stocks to the front lines
remains available to Biden without requiring congressional approval.</p>
<p>Moscow’s troops have been capturing village after village in
Ukraine’s east, part of a drive to seize the industrial Donbas region,
while Russian air strikes target a hobbled Ukrainian energy grid as
winter sets in.</p>

<h2
id="white-house-releases-national-strategy-to-combat-islamophobia">White
House releases national strategy to combat Islamophobia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House on Thursday announced what it called the
first national strategy to counter Islamophobia, detailing more than 100
steps federal officials can take to curb hate, violence, bias and
discrimination against Muslims and Arab Americans. </p>
<p>The proposal follows a similar national plan to battle antisemitism
that President Joe Biden unveiled in May 2023, as fears about increasing
hatred and discrimination were rising among U.S. Jews. </p>
<p>Officials worked on the anti-Islamophobia plan for months, and its
release came five weeks before Biden leaves office — meaning
implementation will mostly fall to President-elect Donald Trump, if his
administration chooses to do so. </p>
<p>In a statement announcing the strategy, the Biden administration
wrote that “over the past year, this initiative has become even more
important as threats against American Muslim and Arab communities have
spiked.” It said that included the October 2023 slaying of 6-year-old
Wadee Alfayoumi, an American Muslim boy of Palestinian descent, who was
stabbed to death in Illinois. </p>
<p>The plan details actions the Executive Branch can take, along with
more than 100 other calls to action across all sectors of society. </p>
<p>Four pillars of plan</p>
<p>The strategy has four basic priorities: increasing awareness of
hatred against Muslims and Arabs while more widely recognizing these
communities’ heritages; broadly improving their safety and security;
appropriately accommodating Muslim and Arab religious practices by
working to curb discrimination against them; and encouraging
cross-community solidarity to further counter hate. </p>
<p>Many of those goals are similar to ones the Biden administration laid
out in its plan to reduce antisemitism — especially the emphasis on
improving safety and security and building cross-community
solidarity. </p>
<p>“While individuals have sometimes been targeted because they are
thought to be Muslim, it is also crucial to recognize that Arabs are
routinely targeted simply for being who they are,” the announcement of
the strategy states, noting that Muslims and Arab Americans have helped
build out the nation since its founding. It says that new data
collection and education efforts are “increasing awareness of these
forms of hate as well of the proud heritages of Muslim and Arab
Americans.” </p>
<p>The plan calls for more widely disseminating successful practices of
engaging Muslim and Arab Americans in the reporting of hate crimes, and
notes that more federal agencies are now more clearly spelling out that
“discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans in federally funded
activities is illegal.” </p>
<p>The White House’s plan also urges “state, local and international
counterparts, as well as the nongovernmental sector, to pursue similar
initiatives that seek to build greater unity by recognizing our common
humanity, affirming our shared values and history, and embracing equal
justice, liberty and security for all.” </p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian groups, decrying his administration’s full-throated
support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza, frequently disrupted
Biden campaign events, as well as those of Vice President Kamala Harris
after Biden abandoned his reelection bid in July. </p>
<p>Trump, who implemented a travel ban on people from several
Muslim-majority countries during his first term, won the largest
majority-Muslim U.S. city in last month’s elections. Yet some Arab
Americans who backed Trump have begun expressing concerns about some of
his choices to fill his Cabinet and other positions for his incoming
administration. </p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, largest Muslim civil
rights and advocacy organization in the U.S., panned what it called “the
White House’s long-delayed document” as “too little, too late.” </p>
<p>“The White House strategy lays out some positive recommendations
related to anti-Muslim bigotry, but it has been released too late to
make an impact, fails to promise any changes to federal programs that
perpetuate anti-Muslim discrimination on a massive scale,” the council
said in a statement. The council further noted that the plan doesn’t
address what it called a “federal watchlist” targeting some
Arab-Americans as potential terrorists. </p>
<p>It added that the plan “fails to promise an end the most significant
driver of anti-Muslim bigotry today: the U.S.-backed genocide in
Gaza.”</p>

say suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing wasn’t client of
insurer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian
Thompson was not a client of the medical insurer and may have targeted
it because of its size and influence, a senior police official said
Thursday.</p>
<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told NBC New York in an
interview Thursday that investigators have uncovered evidence that Luigi
Mangione had prior knowledge UnitedHealthcare was holding its annual
investor conference in New York City.</p>
<p>Mangione also mentioned the company in a note found in his possession
when he was detained by police in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We have no indication that he was ever a client of UnitedHealthcare,
but he does make mention that it is the fifth-largest corporation in
America, which would make it the largest health care organization in
America. So that’s possibly why he targeted that company,” said
Kenny.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market
capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S.
health insurer.</p>
<p>Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was
arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald’s in the city of
Altoona, about 370 kilometers (about 230 miles) west of New York City.
His lawyer there, Thomas Dickey, has said Mangione intends to plead not
guilty. Dickey also said he has yet to see evidence decisively linking
his client to the crime.</p>
<p>Mangione’s arrest came five days after the caught-on-camera killing
of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel.</p>
<p>Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel where the health
insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of
Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing
on a bicycle through Central Park.</p>
<p>Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so
that he can face a murder charge in Thompson’s killing. A hearing has
been scheduled for Dec. 30.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old, who police say was found with a “ghost gun” matching
shell casings found at the site of the shooting, is charged in
Pennsylvania with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and
providing false identification to police.</p>
<p>Mangione is an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real
estate family. In posts on social media, Mangione wrote about
experiencing severe chronic back pain before undergoing a spinal fusion
surgery in 2023. Afterward, he posted that the operation had been a
success and that his pain had improved and mobility returned. He urged
others to consider the same type of surgery.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, police said investigators are looking at his writings
about his health problems and his criticism of corporate America and the
U.S. health care system.</p>
<p>Kenny said in the NBC interview that Mangione’s family reported him
missing to San Francisco authorities in November.</p>

<h2 id="this-might-be-the-last-chance-for-permitting-reform">This Might
Be the Last Chance for Permitting Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI5NDg5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDQ2NTIwMH0.Fi3TEGf_0gyb-QnbAIq9nUioa0j9NGGt5vMPx-08wIU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
So … is the permitting reform bill any good or not?
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and John
Barrasso of Wyoming proposed a bill that would change federal
environmental rules so as to spur a buildout of new energy
infrastructure around the country.
</p>
<p>
Their proposal would have loosened rules for oil and gas drilling and
exporting while changing federal law to encourage the construction of
more clean energy.
</p>
<p>
These renewables-friendly changes included creating a new legal regime
that would push utilities and grid operators to build significantly more
long-distance power lines, triggering a nationwide boost to renewable
resources. They would also have changed the regulations governing
geothermal power generation, allowing new enhanced geothermal wells to
play by the same federal rules that bind oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
The legislation was announced in July and then … nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
Now it seems likely to come back. Congress is eyeing its final agenda
items for the year, and permitting reform is one of them. Representative
Bruce Westerman, a Republican who chairs the House Committee on Natural
Resources, is currently said to be revamping Manchin and Barrasso’s
proposal to include reforms to
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/what-national-environmental-policy-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
National Environmental Policy Act</u></a>, a bedrock law that guides the
process — but not the outcome — of virtually every major decision that
the federal government makes and requires it to study the environmental
impact of its policies.
</p>
<p>
We don’t know what those changes will look like yet, though they’ll have
to come soon — the new Congress gets sworn in in just a few weeks. Which
means lawmakers will have to get the proposed changes, process them, and
decide whether to vote for them in a very short period of time — just a
few days.
</p>
<p>
So during this liminal period, then, I wanted to take a moment to look
at the other parts of the bill. Earlier this year, we got a sense of
what the bill’s <em><em>quantitative</em></em> effects might be. They
suggest that the legislation — at least in the initial version proposed
by Manchin and Barrasso — could very well help cut U.S. emissions, or at
least leave them flat. But after that? It starts to get complicated.
</p>
<h3>
Why permitting reform is even happening
</h3>
<p>
Republicans have long pushed for changes to the federal government’s
permitting regime.
</p>
<p>
But in recent years, Democrats — who hope to prompt a national surge of
clean energy construction — have come aboard too. The Biden
administration,
<a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/bidens-climate-chief-delays-and-bottlenecks-slowing-ira-spending-131050663.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frustrated</u></a>
that some parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law haven’t resulted in the large-scale projects they
hoped for, has come to back permitting reform explicitly, although they
have not endorsed Manchin and Barrasso’s bill.
</p>
<p>
“The president has been clear … that we believe permitting reform should
pass on a bipartisan basis — and that we believe permitting needs to be
optimized for building out a clean energy economy,” John Podesta, a
White House senior advisor who is now the country’s top climate
diplomat,
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-senior-advisor-john-podesta-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-priorities-for-energy-infrastructure-permitting-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in a speech</u></a> last year.
</p>
<p>
The White House’s support of bipartisan permitting reform is more than
just posturing: Because of Senate math, any changes to the country’s
permitting laws almost certainly <em><em>must</em></em> be bipartisan.
Until a bare majority of Democratic senators exists to kill
<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/filibuster-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
legislative filibuster</u></a>, it will take a vote of at least 60
senators — a so-called supermajority — to alter most pre-existing
federal legislation.
</p>
<p>
So the question, then, is: Is <em><em>this </em></em>attempt at
permitting reform worth passing? Is <em><em>this </em></em>package of
fossil fuel concessions and clean energy incentives likely to reduce
emissions more than it increases them?
</p>
<p>
I won’t try to answer that question comprehensively today, and we can’t
even answer it fully until we know the scope of Westerman’s changes. But
I do want to share an analysis from the center-left think tank Third Way
and other researchers that suggests that the answer is “yes.”
</p>
<p>
This analysis, released in September, argues that Manchin and Barrasso’s
bill would modestly increase emissions by encouraging more oil and gas
drilling on federal lands. But that increase would likely be dwarfed by
a large decrease in emissions prompted by building out the country’s
electricity transmission grid.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, it finds that while the pro-fossil fuel provisions
could raise global climate pollution by as much as 6.1 million metric
tons by 2050, the bill’s support for transmission could cut emissions by
as much as 15.7 million metric tons in that time (although the final
number, as you’ll see, is a very high end estimate). That’s because,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>as I’ve
written before</u></a>, building the grid will allow for more renewable,
geothermal, and other forms of zero-carbon electricity generation to get
built. And the country can only reduce emissions by building more
zero-carbon electricity.
</p>
<p>
Some of those emissions increases from oil and gas are now likely to
occur whether or not the bill passes — the Trump administration will
encourage fossil fuel extraction and export far beyond what a Harris
administration would have done.
</p>
<p>
But even in a more conservative scenario, the transmission provisions
would still cut emissions by 6.5 million metric tons by 2050, Third
Way’s synthesis says. That would mean — when compared to the pro-fossil
policies — that the bill has a much more modest effect overall, cutting
emissions by just over 400,000 tons through 2050. That is a rounding
error on the U.S. economy’s more than 6 billion tons of greenhouse gas
emissions a year.
</p>
<p>
These aren’t the only numbers out there. An analysis by Jeremy Symons,
the former vice president of public affairs at the Environmental Defense
Fund, argues that the bill’s loosening of some Biden-era restrictions on
liquified natural gas export terminals will result in a tremendous LNG
boom. He
<a href="https://www.symonspa.com/post/assessing-the-climate-impacts-of-the-manchin-barrasso-bill-s-lng-title" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asserts</u></a>
that the bill’s LNG provisions could increase global emissions by 8.5 to
11 gigatons; his analysis, however, draws heavily from a
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/is-lng-dirtier-than-coal-its-complicated/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>controversial</u></a>,
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/a-major-paper-on-liquified-natural-gas-emissions-is-riddled-with-errors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initially
erroneous</u></a>, and now
<a href="https://www.research.howarthlab.org/publications/Howarth_LNG_assessment_preprint_archived_2023-1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updated</u></a>
study from the Cornell ecologist
<a href="https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/robert-warren-howarth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Robert
Howarth</u></a> that contends American natural gas is far worse for the
climate than coal.
</p>
<p>
Third Way did not include Symons’ study in its analysis. Instead, it
cites
<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13738309" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
different study</u></a> led by the Princeton professor Jesse Jenkins
(with whom I cohost Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast) that uses natural-gas
emissions estimates more in line with the broader scholarly literature.
That modeling study indicates that the LNG provisions in the
Manchin-Barrasso bill could increase emissions by as much as 3.3
gigatons — or <em><em>decrease </em></em>them by 2.4 gigatons.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to get more into the LNG question in this story. And it’s
somewhat less important than it was earlier this year because Trump
administration is likely to approve as many LNG export terminals as it
can. (That doesn’t mean those terminals will get built: Right now, a
dozen LNG terminals
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/us-lng-export-terminals-existing-approved-not-yet-built-and-proposed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
been approved but not built</u></a> due to a lack of global demand for
more LNG.) Instead, I want to dive into two specific provisions in the
bill — on oil and gas leasing and transmission — that reveal the broader
challenges of trying to speak concretely about this proposal.
</p>
<h3>
Transmission
</h3>
<p>
By far the most climate-friendly provisions in EPRA concern its support
of long-distance electricity transmission. As I’ve
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-16-ferc-nietc-grid-transmission" target="_self"><u>covered</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>before</u></a>,
the lack of electricity transmission is now one of the biggest barriers
to building new wind, solar, and other clean energy in the United
States; the construction of new wind farms, in particular,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/04/climate/us-wind-energy-solar-power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seems
to be slowing down</u></a> because of a lack of available power lines to
carry their electrons.
</p>
<p>
Manchin and Barrasso’s proposal aims to build more transmission largely
by granting new powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the
independent agency that oversees the country’s power grids. EPRA would,
for instance, allow FERC to step in and approve transmission lines that
are “in the national interest” if a state has not acted on a given
project within a year. The law also clarifies who should pay for a new
power line, encoding the idea that customers who benefit from a line
should pay for it. And it lets FERC approve payments from developers to
the communities where new transmission infrastructure gets built,
potentially smoothing approvals at the local level.
</p>
<p>
The bill also instructs FERC to write a rule that will require each part
of the country to build a minimal amount of power lines that allow
regions to exchange power with their neighbors. This measure — meant to
spur new “interregional” transmission infrastructure — aims to knit the
national grid more closely together and lower power costs on average.
</p>
<p>
How much would these policies reduce national emissions? The truth is,
that’s extremely difficult to model. “There’s nothing in the EPRA that
says, Thou shalt build this much transmission,”
<a href="https://rmi.org/people/charles-teplin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Charles
Teplin</u></a>, a grid expert at the think tank RMI, told me.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the bill aims to kick off a process that will result in more
transmission getting built. That transmission should — in theory — bring
more renewables online. But what will the size of that buildout be, and
how many emissions will those renewables displace?
</p>
<p>
Answering these questions requires, again, estimating the uncertain. To
come up with a reasonable, conservative figure to represent the amount
of regional transmission that might get built under the new FERC
process, they looked at what happened when a similar process was
overseen by the Midwest’s grid. Then they rounded down that figure
significantly.
</p>
<p>
Teplin and his colleagues also assumed that some big power lines that
have already been proposed nationwide — roughly 15 gigawatts, to be
exact — will get completed faster because of these new laws, so their
analysis starts to bring them online by 2029. One only need look at
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia-transmission-heinrich-pattern-energy" target="_self"><u>the
nearly two-decade saga of SunZia</u></a>, a large power line that
crosses New Mexico and Arizona, to see how long it can take to finish
those projects today.
</p>
<p>
Under those assumptions, the law should more than double the rate of
America’s transmission buildout, Teplin and his team estimated. Right
now, the country builds perhaps 1 gigawatt of new transmission lines
every year; under their assumptions, that would leap to 2 to 4 gigawatts
a year.
</p>
<p>
So how many emissions would these new lines avoid? Using
<a href="https://cleanenergygrid.org/portfolio/transmission-projects-ready-to-go-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
report</u></a> published by Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting
firm that advocates for more transmission, Teplin and his colleagues
estimate that each “gigawatt-mile” of new transmission will let
operators add about 32 gigawatts of solar and wind to the grid each
year. (This suggests that, most of the time, the lines would run at
about 30% of capacity.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, the team assumed that electricity from these new renewable
projects will replace power from natural gas plants. That, too, is an
approximation: Some of those new wind and solar farms will drive out
coal plants; others might replace non-emitting resources like nuclear or
hydroelectric dams; but in general they will reduce gas burning.
</p>
<p>
When you put all those figures together, RMI’s analysis suggests that
the legislation could build roughly twice as much new clean energy
generation by 2050 as exists in <em><em>all fossil-fuel power plants
today</em></em>. These new resources would help avoid about 6.5 gigatons
of greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century.
</p>
<p>
That may seem like a big number — but Third Way was actually able to
reach an even larger estimate. Teplin and his team didn’t try to
differentiate, for instance, between the effects of
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-strengthens-order-no-1920-expanded-state-provisions#:~:text=FERC%20today%20largely%20affirmed%20its,and%20clarification%20of%20Order%20No." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
recent FERC order</u></a>, which requires utilities to build more
transmission within regions, and the proposed Manchin-Barrasso bill,
which shores up the legality of that FERC order and would also induce
utilities to build more power lines between regions. Some legal experts
argue that the recent FERC order will be on shaky ground if the
Manchin-Barrasso bill doesn’t pass; others say it’s stable enough as-is.
</p>
<p>
If you assume that courts will kill the FERC order unless Congress acts,
then that should <em><em>raise</em></em> your estimate of what
Manchin-Barrasso might do. That’s essentially what Third Way did — by
giving the bill more credit for the resulting regional transmission
buildout, they say that its carbon upside could be as large as 15.7
gigatons over the next 25 years. I’m not sure I would be that
aggressive, but I think the transmission provisions would likely
initiate a big buildout of renewables.
</p>
<h3>
Oil and gas leasing
</h3>
<p>
The Manchin-Barrasso bill contains a number of provisions that aim to
increase the leasing of federal land for oil and gas drilling. One set
requires that the Interior Department must offer a minimum amount of
acres every year for oil and gas leasing. It also says that the land
offered must be land that oil and gas companies actually
<em><em>want</em></em> to lease.
</p>
<p>
This would address one of Republicans’ biggest objections to how the
Biden administration has handled oil and gas extraction on federally
owned land. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Manchin
<a href="https://iratracker.org/programs/ira-section-50265-requiring-oil-gas-lease-sales-in-exchange-for-solar-and-wind-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>
that the government offer a minimum amount of oil and gas acreage for
every acre of public land it leased to wind and solar developers. But
Republicans have accused the Biden administration of getting around this
rule by, in essence, offering useless or otherwise undesirable land.
</p>
<p>
(This concession, I should add, is now essentially moot until 2029, as
the Trump administration will hasten to nominate the parcels that oil
and gas companies are most excited to drill on. But it could bind a
future Democratic administration, requiring them to offer good parcels
for oil and gas leasing at the same time that they offer federal land
for renewable development.)
</p>
<p>
The bill would also change some of the rules around the drilling allowed
on the borders of federally owned land. Under the Manchin-Barrasso bill,
companies could drill a vertical well on privately owned land, then
extend it horizontally underground into federal land to extract oil or
gas.
</p>
<p>
These provisions, too, are difficult to model. Much like the
transmission proposal, they won’t lead to a guaranteed amount of
drilling (although they will essentially produce a minimum<em>
</em>amount of fossil fuel leasing). Nor will they substantially change
the drilling that happens under Donald Trump or a future Republican
president because any fossil fuel-loving administration is already free
to go much further than these provisions would require them to.
</p>
<p>
To estimate the emissions impact of these provisions, the think tank
Resources for the Future first tried to draw some error bars around
their analysis. As a worst-case scenario, analysts modeled what would
happen if the onshore drilling that happened during the Trump
administration occurred every year from 2025 to 2050. Under this “Trump
forever” scenario, emissions increase about 2.1 gigatons from 2025 to
2050. Under a less dire scenario, they would increase by about 0.6
gigatons during the same period.
</p>
<p>
These estimates almost certainly exceed what EPRA would actually do,
<a href="https://www.rff.org/people/kevin-rennert/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kevin
Rennert</u></a>, the director of RFF’s federal climate policy
initiative, told me.
</p>
<p>
“None of the provisions would require the levels of leasing that we’re
analyzing in the high-leasing scenario,” he said. “It’s clear [that the
model is] a high upper bound on what EPRA itself would drive.” The
provisions in the Manchin-Barrasso bill, in other words, are aimed much
more at putting a floor under a future Democratic administration than
they are raising a ceiling for a future Republican administration.
</p>
<p>
(Over all these discussions hangs a curious question about drilling for
oil and gas on public land: How important is it, really? But that’s a
question for another time.)
</p>
<h3>
What political bet would you make?
</h3>
<p>
How you feel about this reform effort ultimately depends on how you feel
about gambling. Is it worth hamstringing a future Democratic president’s
ability to hem in oil production in exchange for unleashing a wave of
new transmission under the Trump administration? How much do you weigh
building more renewables versus selling more fossil fuels to the world?
</p>
<p>
Trump’s victory last month also changes the calculus. His administration
will increase onshore oil and gas leasing regardless of whether this
bill passes or not. He will stop the Energy Department’s effort to slow
down the construction of LNG terminals and approve a new wave of
projects. All of the bill’s support for fossil fuels, in other words,
would be moot — Trump will do that stuff anyway. So the question becomes
whether the bill’s support for <em><em>new</em></em> transmission
infrastructure 1) actually builds new power lines, and 2) provides a
useful tailwind for renewables and clean energy during what would
otherwise be a difficult four years.
</p>
<p>
You can go in almost endless loops through the politics here. Given
Trump’s antipathy toward renewables, why should we expect his
administration to allow a transmission buildout in the first place,
regardless of what Congress says? In which case, maybe the bill isn’t
worth it. But on the other hand, maybe it is — since Trump’s going to do
everything he can to juice fossil fuels and fight renewables, why not
pass the bill and give power system regulators in blue and purple states
an extra tool to juice clean energy construction? And hey, given Trump’s
friendliness toward the AI boom, maybe he’ll wind up <em><em>having
</em></em>to build more transmission just to service data centers.
</p>
<p>
We can’t make that political call quite yet. Until we know exactly how
Westerman’s addition to the legislation would change NEPA, it’s hard to
say where lawmakers should come down. But what’s clear is that this may
be Congress’s last chance to deal with permitting reform for a while.
Next year, the Republican majority is likely to be focused on tax cuts,
and it’s not even clear that the reconciliation process would allow for
changing permitting law. “We’re pretty pessimistic that you could
include anything on permitting or transmission or any of these other
things in the reconciliation process,”
<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/people/devin-hartman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Devin
Hartman</u></a>, a policy director at the center-right think tank the R
Street Institute, told Heatmap this week.
</p>
<p>
So this is it for permitting reform — it’s now or never for this set of
changes. In a year full of surprises for climate and environmental law,
we may yet get one more.

officials stress collaboration with Japan, South Korea amid Seoul
leadership crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers and diplomatic officials stressed the
need for close cooperation among the United States, South Korea and
Japan in response to the possible impeachment of South Korean President
Yoon Suk Yeol. </p>
<p>The officials say that Yoon, who could be removed from office as soon
as this weekend over a short-lived imposition of martial law that threw
his country into turmoil, has played an important role in the informal
U.S. alliance that Washington has forged in the Asia-Pacific
region. </p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, who spoke to VOA Korean on Wednesday, said Yoon’s
diplomacy has “strengthened South Korea vis-a-vis China and Russia and
other emerging threats in the Pacific.”  </p>
<p>“The collaboration between South Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
Australia — that is probably going to do more to deter hostilities than
anything else. So, that has to be maintained,” said Reed, chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee. </p>
<p>He emphasized that the presence of a significant number of U.S.
forces in South Korea “keeps the North Koreans from doing something rash
and very destructive to South Korea.” More than 28,000 U.S. troops are
stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>“That relationship — the United States and South Korea — I think, is
made more formidable when Japan is also part of it, and the Philippines
are also part of it,” Reed said. “And I think South Korean people have
to recognize that we’re talking about their safety and security.” </p>
<p>The embattled president has been criticized in his own country for
pursuing a foreign policy that fostered closer relations with Japan, a
country still reviled by many of his countrymen for its harsh colonial
rule from 1910 to 1945.  </p>
<p>Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
told VOA Korean that a strong relationship between South Korea and Japan
is beneficial to the overall Indo-Pacific region, which faces the rise
of China. </p>
<p>“We know there’s been historic tensions for centuries between Japan
and Korea,” Warner said. “I actually think that level of collaboration
between America, South Korea and Japan is in the best interests of the
region.”  </p>
<p>Andy Kim, who was sworn in this week as the first Korean American
U.S. senator, told VOA Korean he hopes “people recognize the importance
of ensuring that South Korea remains engaged in the region.”  </p>
<p>“I do think that the work that has been happening between the United
States, South Korea and Japan is important, and I hope that whoever is
the leader and whatever happens next in South Korea, that type of work
continues,” said Kim, who expressed shock at Yoon’s declaration of
martial law on Dec. 3.  </p>
<p>The South Korean president said his decision was aimed at
“eradicating pro-North Korean forces and to protect the constitutional
order of freedom.” Soon after his declaration, a majority of South
Korean lawmakers voted to overturn the order. Yoon, who was legally
obligated to comply with the vote, did so six hours after his original
declaration. </p>
<p>South Korean lawmakers pushed Dec. 7 to impeach Yoon for the failed
martial law declaration. The resolution accused Yoon of putting South
Korea on the brink of war by operating a foreign policy “hostile to
North Korea, China and Russia, but centered on Japan.” The
opposition-led attempt failed because a boycott by Yoon’s ruling
People’s Party left the legislature short of the necessary
quorum.   </p>
<p>Yoon now faces another impeachment vote, which he vowed Thursday to
“fight to the end.”  </p>
<p>Representative Marilyn Strickland, who recently secured a U.S. House
seat for a third term, called for “good relationships” with allies, when
asked about the controversy.  </p>
<p>“If I think about the safety and the freedom of the entire
Indo-Pacific region, it is better to have good relationships with our
allies than to be at odds with each other,” she said in a Zoom interview
Tuesday with VOA Korean.  </p>
<p>‘Disturbing signals’ </p>
<p>U.S. diplomatic and security experts said Yoon’s declaration of
martial law was clearly wrong but questioned whether an impeachment
resolution should be based on his approach to international
relations. </p>
<p>“If you look back at the impeachment resolution, one of the
paragraphs in that impeachment resolution directly attacked President
Yoon for the trilateral partnership that he had established with Japan
and the United States. That was very disturbing,” said Evans Revere, the
former principal deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He spoke to VOA
Korean on Monday via Zoom.  </p>
<p>Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at the Hudson Institute, shared a
similar sentiment. </p>
<p>“It’s disturbing in the sense that if the South Korean opposition is
going to run on an anti-American, anti-Japanese agenda, it sends
disturbing signals to North Korea about alliance unity. It sends
disturbing signals to China about alliance unity,” Weinstein said. </p>
<p>“And frankly, it sends disturbing signals to the incoming Trump
administration about what kind of government South Korea is likely to
have if President Yoon is impeached.” </p>
<p>Harry Harris, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea during the first
Trump administration, told VOA Korean on Tuesday via email that the
cooperation among the U.S., South Korea and Japan should continue. </p>
<p>“I’ve spoken for a while now how important President Yoon’s outreach
to Japan is, especially his meetings in the U.S. and Japan with former
Prime Minister [Fumio] Kishida,” he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has sidestepped questions on the
controversy.  </p>
<p>“We continue to call for the full and proper functioning of the ROK’s
democratic institutions and processes, in accordance with the
constitution,” said a spokesperson for the State Department in an email
to VOA Korean on Saturday. ROK, or the Republic of Korea, is the
official name of South Korea.  </p>
<p>“The United States is committed to the peace and security of the
Korean Peninsula,” the spokesperson said.  </p>

<h2 id="trump-names-kari-lake-as-choice-for-voa-director">Trump names
Kari Lake as choice for VOA director</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he plans to have
Kari Lake, a politician and former Arizona journalist, appointed head of
the international government-funded broadcaster Voice of America.</p>
<p>Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that Lake
would be appointed director of VOA. Lake is a close political ally of
the president-elect and a former anchor for a Fox News television
station in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>She worked in journalism for 27 years before leaving the profession
in 2021 to run for Arizona governor.</p>
<p>During an unsuccessful run for Senate in 2024, Lake said Arizona
should be a “standard bearer for America First policies.”</p>
<p>Trump also wrote Wednesday that he would soon announce his pick to
head the U.S. Agency for Global Media, known as USAGM, which oversees
VOA along with other U.S.-funded broadcasters. That position is
presidentially nominated and requires Senate approval. Trump said his
pick for CEO would appoint and work closely with Lake.</p>
<p>The chief executive of the publicly funded USAGM ensures that the
broadcasters are meeting their missions to produce credible and accurate
journalism to countries with limited free media.</p>
<p>VOA’s current director, Mike Abramowitz, sent an email to staff
Thursday morning saying that he read the announcement about Lake
Wednesday night and had not been given additional information beyond the
social media post.</p>
<p>“I welcome a smooth transition of power for both USAGM and VOA. I
intend to cooperate with the new administration and follow the process”
for the appointment of the director of VOA, he wrote.</p>
<p>2020 law restructured agency management</p>
<p>The USAGM CEO has the power to hire or dismiss network heads, but
under a bipartisan bill passed in December 2020, network head changes
require a majority vote of the International Broadcasting Advisory
Board.</p>
<p>The board consists of six presidentially appointed members who serve
staggered terms, plus the secretary of state. Its function is to advise
the CEO to ensure that he or she respects the editorial independence and
integrity of the networks and grantees, and that the highest standards
of journalism are upheld.</p>
<p>In a post on the social media platform X, Lake said she is honored to
be considered for the VOA role. She said that VOA is a “vital
international media outlet” that promotes “democracy and truth.”</p>
<p>“Under my leadership, the VOA will excel in its mission: chronicling
America’s achievements worldwide.” VOA attempted to reach Lake for
comment via the media section of her campaign website, but as of
publication had not received a response.</p>
<p>VOA broadcasts to a weekly audience of 354 million people in 49
languages. Its current director, Abramowitz, is the former president of
Freedom House and was a reporter and editor for The Washington Post for
24 years.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
My biggest takeaway of this year? Bad information is breaking the energy
transition – and the fake news is only getting more powerful.
</p>
<p>
Across the country, we’re seeing solar, wind, and battery storage
projects grind to a halt thanks to activism powered by fears of health
and safety risks, many of which are unfounded, unproven, exaggerated, or
conspiratorial in nature. There are some prominent examples, like
worries about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/renewables-wildlife-impact" target="_self"><u>offshore
wind and whales</u></a>, but I’ve spent a large chunk of The Fight’s
lifespan so far investigating a few crucial case studies, from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hecate-energy-acton-mike-garcia" target="_self"><u>wildfire
fears</u></a> confronting battery developers in California to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/atlantic-shores-transmission-opposition" target="_self"><u>cancer
concerns</u></a> curtailing a crucial transmission line in New Jersey.
To tell you the honest truth, it is difficult to quantify just how
troubling this issue is for the industry.
</p>
<p>
False information is something Mark Thomson, a D.C.-based attorney with
the law firm Meier Watkins Phillips Pusch LLP, thinks about a lot these
days. Thomson was one of the lawyers who won a record $787 million
settlement for Dominion Voting Systems from Fox News Network after it
broadcast incorrect claims about how the company’s ballot machines were
used in the 2020 election. Today his attention is elsewhere –
conspiracy-powered defamation against renewables developers and their
projects. .
</p>
<p>
“This is a sizable and growing part of what we do here,” Thomson told
me. “I think it’s because the developer sector writ large increasingly
understands the severity and the pervasiveness of falsehoods in that
space, and also just as importantly how quickly groups and communities
can latch onto these falsehoods in ways that critically interrupt and
even endanger some of these projects.”
</p>
<p>
Why are we talking about conspiracy theorists as an opposition
powerhouse? Well, studies show that like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/solar-farmland" target="_self"><u>working
in agriculture</u></a> or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/poll-large-landowners" target="_self"><u>owning
large tracts of land</u></a>, scientific skepticism can be a big signal
that someone will oppose a renewables project. A 2022 study
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-022-01164-w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
in the journal </u><u><em><em>Nature Energy</em></em></u></a><em>
</em>found “moderate-to-large” relationships between indices of
conspiracy beliefs and the likelihood that someone would oppose a wind
farm, and that the relationship between wind farm opposition and
conspiracy beliefs was “many times greater than its relationship with
age, gender, education, and political orientation.”
</p>
<p>
Conspiracies or misinformation can also be weaponized by hostile local,
state, or federal regulators if they have other reasons to try and
curtail development.
</p>
<p>
Take St. Clair County, Michigan, where a leading local public health
official is leveraging theories about the impact of solar energy to try
and limit development. St. Clair County is home to its own fun blend of
renewables consternation. The most acerbic fight is in the town of Fort
Gratiot, where Ranger Power subsidiary
<a href="https://portsidesolar.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Portside
Solar</u></a> has proposed to construct a 100 MW solar facility. The
project is in a rural, largely agricultural region and has faced
incredible resentment. (If you want a primer on the conflict, watch
<a href="https://bluewaterhealthyliving.com/shows/eileen-tesch-living-exponentially/fort-gratiot-solar-controversy-angela-defrain-robert-fielitz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this
interview segment</u></a> – in between featured ads for Ivermectin.)
</p>
<p>
Last Thursday evening, St. Clair County medical director Remington Nevin
testified before the county’s board of commission that “very clear
health threats” caused by solar energy required “extraordinary actions”
under the state public health code. Nevin specifically addressed noise,
claiming that the sound produced by hypothetical solar facilities could
“presumably be an unreasonable threat to public health” if not kept
below certain decibel thresholds.
</p>
<p>
“This should not be controversial,” Nevin told the audience, which
erupted into rapturous applause after his testimony.
</p>
<p>
This testimony, prompted by public comments from disgruntled residents,
came after Nevin issued a report detailing his desires for quick action
under the public health code that circulated widely on anti-renewables
Facebook groups.
</p>
<p>
Nevin is definitely a qualified medical professional. “Occupational
medicine is the successor to the field of industrial medicine,” Nevin
told me when I emailed him about his qualifications, “and is the medical
speciality most applicable to the health effects of industrial
activities such as these.” He noted that he has a doctoral public health
degree in mental health and psychiatric epidemiology, and has done
fellowship training in occupation and environmental medicine.
</p>
<p>
But he is not a specialist in the health effects of solar panels. He’s
actually an expert
<a href="https://quinism.org/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
quinism</u></a>, a brain and brainstem disease caused by a toxic
exposure to anti-malaria drugs. This position made him relevant during
the COVID-19 lockdowns, when he
<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/video/news/health/coronavirus/dr-remington-nevin-talks-about-risks-of-using-chloroquine-to-treat-coronavirus/65-a969d7f9-d20f-476c-b99a-512157613706" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spoke
out</u></a> about the risks of taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven
COVID-19 treatment that Trump and other socially conservative figures
began
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recommending</u></a>
at the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Nevin took a more contrarian
view of the scientific debate around COVID-19 during those lockdowns,
<a href="https://x.com/RemingtonNevin/status/1314254753443053575" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signing
a declaration</u></a> to open society up before a vaccine was widely
available. He still feels passionately about this topic today,
<a href="https://x.com/RemingtonNevin/status/1861883634241724626" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>celebrating</u></a>
Trump’s pick to run the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jay
Bhattacharya, who
<a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/trump-taps-bhattacharya-to-lead-national-institutes-of-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coauthored
that declaration</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
When I asked Nevin about his lack of expertise in the health risks of
technology like solar panels, he responded by saying he believes a court
would consider him expert enough for his views to hold legal weight.
</p>
<p>
“In matters such as these, a court ultimately determines the validity of
an expert’s qualifications,” he said. “I am confident that my background
is particularly germane and well-suited to this topic, and that my
qualifications and recommendations will withstand judicial review should
these matters become subject to litigation in due course.”
</p>
<p>
For what it is worth, it’s incredibly hard to find evidence that the
noise emitted from solar farms creates a risk to public health. Industry
says such data is
<a href="https://www.solarctrl.com/blog/solar-inverter-noise-levels/#:~:text=Noise%20levels%20are%20quantified%20in,typically%20measures%20about%2060%20dB." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>infinitesimal</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
There is also at least some apparent temptation of the courts at work in
all this, too. Nevin, local leaders, and activists have in public
comments about the health risks repeatedly referenced Act 233, a new
state law that allows an independent agency to adjudicate conflicts
between developers and towns with restrictions on renewable energy
projects. As we previously scooped, municipalities and counties are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/michigan-pa233-lawsuit-renewable-energy-permitting" target="_self"><u>challenging
the legality</u></a> of how that law is being implemented. It is
entirely possible that part of Nevin’s crusade against the health
impacts of solar on county residents is an attempt to stop the state
from usurping the county’s local control.
</p>
<p>
As opponents of renewable energy look to use the court system in this
way, it may be worthwhile for developers to do the same to combat
misinformation. Courts can decide when a company is being defamed or
unjustly maligned, and the legal system can be an avenue for resolving
the vexing issue of conspiracies and misinformation about the health and
safety of a renewables project.
</p>
<p>
Hence why as renewables deployment rises in the U.S., and opposition
does too, attorneys like Thomson are going to see a lot more business
from developers.
</p>
<p>
“The law provides some remedies in some circumstances,” Thomson told me.
“It’s not a silver bullet. But for specific types of falsehoods, the law
can provide an important source of accountability and just as
importantly, invoking the law can help people realize that there is a
price to be paid for just blatantly and often willfully misleading
groups of citizens about this stuff.”

<h2 id="the-top-five-renewable-energy-fights-of-the-year">The Top Five
Renewable Energy Fights of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTMwNTkwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzQ2NzE5NX0.krHsAP4oES2fdE4Wew2M9WGeeWQ717V8xaZrqBGcElQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=886&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Alright, friends. It’s time for a special edition of The Fight’s
Hotspots, where we walk you through what we believe were the five most
important project conflicts of the year. We decided this list based on
the notoriety of the fight within the renewables sector as well as
whether our reporting found it to be significant for the entire
industry. And we included the opposition scores for these projects based
on our internal Heatmap Pro data to help you better understand whether
these fights were flukes or quite predictable.
</p>
<p>
We hope this helps you all in this,<em><em> errhmm</em></em>, trying
time for developers right now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Lava Ridge’s bad year – Magic Valley, Idaho (36 opposition
score)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
LS Energy’s Lava Ridge wind project might wind up the textbook example
of how <em><em>not</em></em> to build a wind farm. The developer had
initially botched getting consent from those most passionate about a
nearby historic World War II internment camp for Japanese Americans, so
despite its site in a gust-heavy rural landscape and a state ordinarily
friendly to wind power, the project remains in hot water.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u>previously
told</u></a> you how Idaho Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho warned of a potential
executive order targeting Lava Ridge’s permit approvals.<br/>
</li>
<li>
However, a new wrinkle: the federal government completed its permitting
for Lava Ridge and formally approved the project. It also appears from
<a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/politics-government/2024-12-10/blm-lava-ridge-wind-mike-simpson-minidoka-japanese-internment" target="_blank"><u>media
reports</u></a> that at least some activists’ concerns have been
tempered by buffers the federal government placed on future wind
development near the historic site.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Is… this victory? Unfortunately, plenty could still happen here. If a
party were to sue, a future Trump administration would easily have the
right to negotiate a settlement over that challenge and say it needs
more analysis. I wouldn’t consider this project safe yet.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Oregon opts out of offshore wind – Coos County, Oregon (50
opposition score)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
All of the sudden, over the course of an
<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/september-2024-earths-2nd-warmest-september-on-record/" target="_blank"><u>unusually
warm</u></a> September week, Oregon’s Democratic political leaders
abandoned the development of floating offshore wind following an
opposition campaign tied to local consternation and tribal
heritage.<br/>
</li>
<li>
As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/offshore-wind-oregon" target="_self"><u>we
explained</u></a> at the time, this led to the federal government
canceling what would’ve been Oregon’s first lease sale for floating
offshore wind. Now there’s essentially no chance of a lease sale for at
least another four years, because Trump promised to halt all offshore
wind development.<br/>
</li>
<li>
What does this mean? For starters, Democrats can turn into opponents of
renewables too, overruling potential benefits for the climate or
reliability, when pieces of their fractious coalitions turn sour over
the perceived harms they see in development. (See also: the Piedmont
<a href="https://marylandmatters.org/briefs/cardin-expresses-concerns-about-data-centers-in-md-power-line-project/" target="_blank"><u>transmission
line</u></a> in Maryland).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Oak Run and angry voltaics – Madison County, Ohio (96
opposition score)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Savion’s Oak Run was supposed to be the model for how to build solar in
harmony with a farming community. By co-locating solar panel siting and
some crop production, it was supposed to show that solar can be in the
same place as farmland without harming even a scintilla of the food
supply.<br/>
</li>
<li>
It didn’t go that way. Instead, Oak Run this year cemented itself as a
poster child for conflict in renewables-hostile Ohio. We’ve explained
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/oak-run-savion-madison-county-ohio" target="_self"><u>a
legal challenge</u></a> over the project will decide the fate of all
other renewables systems in the state.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The farmland dilemma itself is a bit of a misinformation problem. A
<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2024/september/agricultural-land-near-solar-and-wind-projects-usually-remained-in-agriculture-after-development/" target="_blank"><u>USDA
study</u></a> released in September found that only up to roughly a
fifth of farmland used for solar between 2012 and 2020 was taken out of
production once panels were uninstalled.<br/>
</li>
<li>
And Oak Run’s issues itself may have ties to conspiracies, as the
project’s loose connection to tech billionaire Bill Gates has become a
bit of a
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" target="_blank"><u>rallying
cry</u></a> for local opponents.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. bp’s Kentucky heartaches – Elizabethtown, Kentucky (63
opposition score)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Quite a bit
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/18/1154867064/solar-power-misinformation-activists-rural-america" target="_blank"><u>has
been written</u></a> about the anti-renewables group Citizens for
Responsible Solar. But it’s still hard not to marvel at just how
<em><em>easily</em></em> they win in places in Kentucky, where a small
but mighty group of residents have mobilized against oil giant bp in the
city of Elizabethtown to all but kill a
<a href="https://www.telestosolar.com" target="_blank"><u>128 megawatt
solar farm</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We told
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u>you
a month ago</u></a> that we thought CRS would win against bp despite a
clear plan to use private land and local donations to finally get
shovels and steel into the ground – because it doesn’t take that many
people to convince a city that popular will is on the side of the
opposition.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Well, it turns out we were right. CRS
<a href="https://www.thenewsenterprise.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-to-the-editor-nov-23-2024/article_5ec3731b-a32e-52a9-8760-302c9d84847f.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawHHTQdleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHY6ZP3pKGSsuMzSwXNihG_flcRj1Qs-esYzfOfy-sS1-MTo74g40l_kOtw_aem__SP4SntjXPLIbxsyNAJ8WQ" target="_blank"><u>is
now celebrating</u></a> that it got Elizabethtown to deny bp’s request
for annexation to use the private land, after a large group showed up to
the preceding city council meeting.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Elizabethtown’s denial has not previously been reported by the media,
which is a big reason why Telesto Solar is on our list – it is our best
indication yet that massive utility-scale solar projects might be
getting snuffed out without the broader public knowing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>5. Battery fire fears beat blackouts – Katy, Texas (54
opposition score)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No story sent a chill down my spine this year like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/agri-voltaics-kansas-savion-invenergy" target="_self"><u>what
happened</u></a> in Katy, a small city outside of Houston, where fears
fomented after a battery storage fire near San Diego, California, led to
such a strong anti-battery fervor that it killed a 500 megawatt project
in a blackout prone area.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Why? At the vote to reject the project, Katy City Councilor Gina Hicks,
voted against constructing the battery project even though she thought
it would lead to blackouts. Popular will had won out so profoundly she
felt as a “public servant” she had to vote no.
</li>
<li>
“I feel like this is a mob vote,” she said at
<a href="https://katytx.new.swagit.com/videos/317576" target="_blank"><u>the
October council vote</u></a>. “Just know that we as a community chose
this and I will represent what the community wants versus what I feel is
personally best for this decision.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
I chose Katy over
<a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2024/09/09/dispelling-disinformation-on-battery-fire-in-escondido/" target="_blank"><u>the
San Diego fight</u></a> because it demonstrated how quickly a kernel of
truth — rare but possible battery fires — can ricochet across social
media and prompt action in other parts of the country.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trump-and-the-keystonization-of-renewable-energy">Trump and the
Keystonization of Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTMwNTk4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTU1MTE1OH0._i9VPOxjRMe9zNp0u_PDiZt5z7o7Zzoj7l5zajJD74w/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Today’s special Q&amp;A is with an old source of mine, Devin Hartman,
energy and environment policy director for the conservative D.C. think
tank R Street.
</p>
<p>
When I used to cover Congress, Devin was one of the few climate-minded
conservatives willing to offer a candid, principled take on what could
happen in that always deliberative body. I decided for our year-end
edition to ask him a lot of questions, including an important one: will
Trump make it easier or more difficult to permit solar and wind
projects?
</p>
<p>
His answer – that it is very much possible – led us once again down the
rabbit hole of conspiracy-powered politics.
</p>
<p>
<em><em>The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
</em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Let’s start with the U.S. climate elephant in the room – what do
you think will happen to the Inflation Reduction Act next Congress?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have not talked to any Republican staff, members of Congress, or
strategists that think full IRA repeal is on the table. Just nip that
conversation in the bud right now. That said, they will need to find
where to cut some tax credits to pay for the tax extensions. There will
be strong pressure to modify those subsidies. So I think subsidy reform
is very much on the table but full IRA repeal is not. More specifically,
Republicans will be eyeing the electric vehicle tax credit and the PTC
and ITC that primarily focus on wind and solar.
</p>
<p>
Most of the expenditures under IRA are subsidies for mature
technologies. I think what you’re going to see is something that is a
phase down if not a staggered phase out as on the table for mature
technologies, especially wind, solar and EVs.
</p>
<p>
The thing that’s missing in this narrative so much is that in hindsight
the Inflation Reduction Act is not nearly as much of a climate savior as
its proponents claim. Folks realized we need all this permitting, all
this regulatory reform so we can actually build this stuff and a lot of
what we were recognizing is that before the IRA passed, the private
sector was going to fund a massive amount of new infrastructure,
especially mature technologies. But you couldn’t get the stuff built. So
the policy discussion a few years ago really should’ve focused on
regulatory and permitting reform… and it prioritized subsidies mostly
instead.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay. Moving on, folks in Trump’s orbit proffer in conspiracies
and misinformation, disinformation about renewable energy – are you at
all concerned about the next Trump administration turning against
individual solar and wind projects in the permitting process based on
those views? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah. We’ve seen this getting done under the past several
administrations — more polarization. A lot of stakeholders have called
this the <em><em>Keystonization</em></em> of energy permitting. That’s
really concerning.<br/><br/>I always think of presidents or any elected
official as more followers to their political milieu than leaders in
their own right. We started to see this with President Obama where some
of his advisors and his team said, why does something like
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Keystone XL</u></a> matter that much? It doesn’t make or break that
much… but you saw a lot of this technology and project tribalism really
kicking in with different groups and that clearly influenced political
decision-making. It started removing the permitting process from an
objective criteria-based approach. It’s really concerning to see this
trend move forward. And subsequently on both sides of the aisle you’ve
seen this temptation, mostly with presidential administrations given
their authorities, these [Council of Environmental Quality] processes or
other things that might put their thumb on the scale in favor of some
resources over others.
</p>
<p>
I would note
<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/ceq/nepa-modernization/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
NEPA reforms</u></a> that Trump got done on his watch. Those NEPA
reforms were cheerleaded by the wind and solar industries. That’s when
you started to see the environmental groups really oppose those NEPA
reforms but the clean energy groups really wanted them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That may be true, but activists fighting projects
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u><strong>tell
me</strong></u></a><strong> they’re really excited for Trump. These
activists believe this – as you put it – Keystonization is going to help
them and we’re going to see the Trump administration become a more
difficult environment to get solar and wind permits on a case-by-case
basis. Do you see that happening? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I would be worried if we started to see indications of that. It’s always
possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Senator Jim Risch
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/lava-ridge-wind-trump-executive-order" target="_self"><u><strong>recently
said</strong></u></a><strong> he expects the Trump administration to
issue a project-by-project executive order. Do you imagine anything in
that world is possible? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s possible.
</p>
<p>
Where we’ve seen more of the red-blue divide is at the state level.
That’s our biggest concern… <em><em>oof. </em></em>That’s been trending
in the wrong direction really severely in recent years. That might be
the single biggest long-term hindrance to energy infrastructure
development and by extension decarbonization. That issue set is really
tough. And that unfortunately you’ve seen some of the fault lines–
</p>
<p>
<strong>–Sorry to interrupt. Do you mean the
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/michigan-pa233-lawsuit-renewable-energy-permitting" target="_self"><u><strong>blue
states</strong></u></a><strong> trying to overrule local control versus
the red states letting localities have the final say,
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/renewable-energys-farmland-free-for-all" target="_self"><u><strong>like
Ohio</strong></u></a><strong>? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. And some of that can be philosophical, irrespective of the
technology. Some of it is home rule versus state government. That is a
factor in it.
</p>
<p>
But going back to some of the misinformation and disinformation stuff…
that’s been concerning.
</p>
<p>
When
<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/research/state-and-local-permitting-for-the-energy-sector-challenges-and-opportunities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>we’ve
surveyed</u></a> a lot of these developers and asked what is motivating
some of this right now? So much of it is Facebook campaigns that were
promoting false perspectives on the consequences of infrastructure
development. Things like the flicker effect from living near wind
turbines causing health effects. A lot of stuff on electro-magnetic
fields. There was just a lot of bad information out there. That has
generated in some cases opposition from communities that is misguided
and unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
One of our big recommendations with this is we learned a lot from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/telecommunications-act-climate-renewable-energy" target="_self"><u>the
Telecommunications Act </u></a>in the ’90s. Whether Congress pursues
something similar for energy infrastructure, I don’t know. But maybe at
the state level at least we should have this conversation where you need
to actually demonstrate harm if you actually have legitimate concerns
about health effects. [It’s] that standing and criteria-based
determination approach to this, rather than this sentiment based
approach that could be based on utter nonsense.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a federal solution to this problem? </strong>
</p>
<p>
In permitting, we’ve had this conversation for a while now about
community engagement – which progressives call for – and judicial
review, which is something conservatives have been calling for. I think
there’s actually some reinforcing and mutually beneficial reforms that
can be done in tandem. Things like narrow standing to individuals and
entities actually affected by the infrastructure, and that standing has
to be tied to demonstrate harm under these statutes – that’s a piece
that can be there.
</p>
<p>
But the other thing you do is come in with good information. You have
standardized packets of information to help communities and siting
bodies make more informed decisions. <em><em>Alright, there can be the
potential economic development benefits to your community. Oh also,
we’re going to be honest about any kind of drawbacks – legitimate local
health and ecosystem effects. </em></em>You create a system that
naturally filters out a bunch of nonsense and also drives in good
information. Those concepts can be reinforced.

id="fbi-should-have-done-more-to-collect-intelligence-before-capitol-riot-watchdog-finds">FBI
should have done more to collect intelligence before Capitol riot,
watchdog finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The FBI should have done more to collect intelligence
before the Capitol riot even though the bureau did prepare for the
possibility of violence on Jan. 6, 2021, according to a watchdog report
Thursday. It also said no undercover FBI employees were present that day
and none of the bureau’s informants was authorized to participate.</p>
<p>The report from the Justice Department inspector general’s office
knocks down a fringe conspiracy theory advanced by some Republicans in
Congress that the FBI played a role in instigating the events that day,
when rioters determined to overturn Republican Donald Trump’s 2020
election loss to Democrat Joe Biden stormed the building in a violent
clash with police.</p>
<p>The review was being released nearly four years after a dark chapter
in history that shook the bedrock of American democracy.</p>
<p>Though narrow in scope, the report aims to shed light on gnawing
questions that have dominated public discourse, including whether major
intelligence failures preceded the riot and whether anyone in the crowd
was for some reason acting at the behest of the FBI. It’s the latest
major investigation about a day unlike any other in U.S. history that
has already yielded congressional inquiries and federal and state
indictments.</p>
<p>The watchdog found that 26 FBI informants were in Washington for
election-related protests on Jan. 6, and though three entered either the
building or a restricted area outside, none had been authorized to do so
by the bureau or to break the law or encourage others to do so.</p>
<p>The report also found that the FBI did take appropriate steps to
prepare for the events of Jan. 6, but failed to scour its 56 field
offices across the country for relevant intelligence.</p>
<p>The watchdog’s lengthy review was launched days after the riot,
following revelations that a Jan. 5, 2021, bulletin prepared by the
FBI’s Norfolk, Virginia, field office warned of the potential for “war”
at the Capitol. The former head of the FBI’s office in Washington has
said that once he received that Jan. 5 warning, the information was
quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint
terrorism task force.</p>
<p>But Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of that
document at the time and have insisted that they had no specific or
credible intelligence that any demonstration at the Capitol would result
in a large-scale attack on the building.</p>
<p>FBI Director Chris Wray, who announced this week his plans to resign
at the end of President Joe Biden’s term in January, has defended his
agency’s handling of the intelligence report. He told lawmakers in 2021
that the report was disseminated through the joint terrorism task force,
discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet
portal available to other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“We did communicate that information in a timely fashion to the
Capitol Police and [Metropolitan Police Department] in not one, not two,
but three different ways,” Wray said at the time.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theory that federal law enforcement officers entrapped
members of the mob has been spread in conservative circles, including by
some Republican lawmakers. Representative Clay Higgins recently
suggested on a podcast that agents pretending to be Trump supporters
were responsible for instigating the violence.</p>
<p>And former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who withdrew as
Trump’s pick as attorney general amid scrutiny over sex trafficking
allegations, sent a letter to Wray in 2021 asking how many informants
were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and if they were “merely passive
informants or active instigators.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t previously clear how many FBI informants were in the crowd
that day. Wray refused to say during a congressional hearing last year
how many of the people who entered the Capitol and surrounding area on
Jan. 6 were either FBI employees or people with whom the FBI had made
contact. But Wray said the “notion that somehow the violence at the
Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI
sources and agents is ludicrous.”</p>
<p>One FBI informant testified last year at the trial of former Proud
Boys leader Enrique Tarrio about marching to the Capitol with his fellow
extremist group members, and described communicating with his handler as
the mob of Trump supporters swarmed the building. But the informant
wasn’t in any of the Telegram chats the Proud Boys were accused of using
to plot violence in the days leading up to Jan. 6.</p>

Your EV Is About to Be as Easy as Charging Your Phone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTMwNTQ4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4Mzg3MjQ4M30.3XpafF4RQ1pRSiQFr0OyCNVqppzKFumQ-Z1XzAx3SxE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
I outsmarted myself the other day. The line at the Tesla Supercharger
was only two or three cars deep, but none of the plugged-in vehicles
looked to be in any hurry to leave. Across the lot were another
company’s high-speed chargers that were newly outfitted with the NACS
plug — meaning I should have been able to charge my Model 3 without even
getting out an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-charging-mess" target="_self"><u>adapter</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
I jumped out of line, zipped over to the empty stall, plugged in … and
couldn’t get the charger to come to life. I had the phone app by
Chargepoint, the third-party company that operates the charger. I had a
credit card on file and money in my account on the app. But still,
nothing. I couldn’t get the phone and the charger to talk to each other.
Embittered by losing my place in line, I continued bitterly down the
road toward the promise of open stalls at a different Supercharger a few
miles away.
</p>
<p>
This is an all-too-common episode for America’s EV drivers. After the
relief of finding an open charger comes the exasperation of finding the
electricity won’t flow — the charging station won’t just shut up and
take your money because of an inoperable touchscreen, a failure to pair
with your phone, or a refusal to accept your credit card.
</p>
<p>
But, just maybe, 2025 will be the year the darkness begins to part. Next
year, SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers)
will launch a “plug-and-charge”
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/universal-plug-and-charge-for-most-evs-is-moving-ahead-for-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initiative</u></a>
alongside a variety of EV manufacturers and energy companies, together
making up the
<a href="https://www.sae-itc.com/programs/evpki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Electric
Vehicle Public Key Infrastructure</u></a> group, which also has testing
support from the Biden Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. Their
goal: a universal protocol to pay for juice that would make charging
seamless.
</p>
<p>
“Universal Plug &amp; Charge levels up the electric fueling experience,
making it even easier than filling up with gas,” Gabe Klein, Executive
Director of the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, said in SAE’s
news release. “We are rapidly approaching a future where every EV driver
can just plug in, charge up, and go; the network will talk to your car
and process the payment seamlessly.”
</p>
<p>
Plug-and-charge is the way Tesla’s Superchargers have always worked,
which — along with the extent and reliability of that network — gave
Tesla a huge leg up on its competition. Drivers have a credit card on
file with the company; when they plug into a charger, it automatically
recognizes the car and charges the card based on that plug’s cost per
kilowatt-hour.
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/714654/evs-plug-charge-capable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Other
EVs</u></a> have managed to create this convenience for their owners,
but it’s a trickier business for non-Tesla automakers who don’t control
both the vehicles and the charging network, and therefore must work out
deals and technology standards with the charging companies.
</p>
<p>
Those other charging networks have presented EV drivers with an
experience that’s more like visiting a gas station, except worse. Some
ask you to pair the charger with an app on your phone via Bluetooth.
Even when the technology works, which it often doesn’t, this requires
drivers to have already downloaded the app and created an account in
advance, otherwise they’re fussing with their phones for minutes on end
just to start charging.
</p>
<p>
Some feature the kind of touchscreen or button-powered display you might
find when you pull up to a gas pump, which is fine when it works. But at
a gas station, there’s typically a person inside a convenience store to
help out if, say, your credit card won’t swipe correctly outside. EV
charging stations, on the other hand, have popped up in parking garages
or the lots around shopping malls, where there’s nary a soul to lend a
hand if the charger won’t activate. For that reason and more, EV
chargers need to <em><em>just work</em></em>.

<p>
The SAE-led initiative is part of a welcome maturation and streamlining
that’s been coming to the EV industry. We’ve talked plenty about how
nearly every automaker over the past couple of years has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-ford-gm" target="_self"><u>adopted</u></a>
the NACS plug that was formerly Tesla’s proprietary technology, leading
EVs to consolidate toward uniformity rather than competing standards.
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sae-industry-technologies-consortia-and-joint-office-of-energy-and-transportation-advance-universal-plug--charge-302321856.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
true industry-wide push</u></a> for plug-and-charge would eliminate one
of the major headaches and sources of anxiety for electrified drivers.
</p>
<p>
And it could do much more. To create universal plug-and-charge, vehicles
would need
<a href="https://www.keyfactor.com/education-center/what-is-pki/#:~:text=Public%20key%20infrastructure%20(PKI)%20governs,end%2Dto%2Dend%20communications." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>public
key-based authentication systems</u></a> to identify themselves and
securely verify that identity. With such a standard in place, EVs would
be a big step closer to a future in which their owners can use the
energy stored in vehicle batteries to do whatever they want.
</p>
<p>
For example, such keys could allow for the advent of widespread
vehicle-to-grid integration, or V2G, where EVs can send energy from
their batteries back onto the grid rather than just drawing power from
it. In this way, EVs could be used to balance the grid and avoid
blackouts, since any plugged-in EV could temporarily become a source of
supply in times of crisis-level demand. (V2G also allows some people to
engage in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-grid-sell-electricity-tesla-powerwall" target="_self"><u>energy
arbitrage</u></a>, selling kilowatt-hours back onto the grid when prices
are high.)
</p>
<p>
The potential wrench in the gears, especially considering the
involvement of President Biden’s joint office, is the forthcoming second
Trump presidency. Representatives of the mission say this effort is
industry-led and -funded, however, and not reliant on federal support to
survive. A better way to charge EVs is in the free market’s hands now.

id="bytedance-seeks-to-delay-us-tiktok-ban-putting-hope-on-trump-administration">ByteDance
seeks to delay US TikTok ban, putting hope on Trump administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As the deadline approaches for ByteDance to divest from
TikTok or face a ban in the United States, the Chinese company made an
appeal Monday to U.S. courts to extend the date of the ultimatum until
after President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p>The current deadline requires ByteDance to divest from TikTok by
Jan. 19, 2025, a day before Trump is sworn into office.</p>
<p>Despite an unsuccessful attempt in his first term to ban the social
media platform, Trump promised during his recent presidential campaign
to save the video-hosting service –– a promise that ByteDance is willing
to bet on as it seeks to extend the “divest or ban” deadline.</p>
<p>In April, Congress addressed the perceived national security concerns
posed by TikTok. The decision to ban or divest the platform was
unanimously upheld as constitutional by the District of Columbia Circuit
Court of Appeals on December 6.</p>
<p>“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United
States,” the court, in an opinion written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg,
said Friday. “Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom
from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to
gather data on people in the United States.”</p>
<p>TikTok has over 170 million users in the United States. A September
survey conducted by the Pew Research Center showed that 17% of American
adults regularly get news from the platform.</p>
<p>Trump, once a staunch opponent of the app, now stands to become its
savior, pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to grant
ByteDance an extension on the deadline.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump signed an executive order banning
TikTok. In the order, which was ultimately blocked by a federal judge,
Trump expressed concerns over data privacy and the threat TikTok could
pose to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>Last June, Trump created a TikTok account which has since amassed
nearly 15 million followers and 106 million likes. In a video posted on
Truth Social in September, he appealed to voters.</p>
<p>“For all of those that want to save TikTok in America, vote for
Trump,” he said.</p>
<p>Analysts argue that Trump’s change in tone could be attributed to his
personal relationship with the platform and its potential use in
negotiations with China.</p>
<p>“Trump became familiar with TikTok during the campaign and saw how it
helped him reach a massive following in the U.S.,” said Anupam Chander,
a law professor at Georgetown University who focuses on global new
technology regulation.</p>
<p>“He also still blames TikTok’s main rival, Facebook, for his election
loss in 2020 because of what he sees as censorship by Facebook,” Chander
told VOA.</p>
<p>Beyond his connection to the app, Trump could benefit from using the
uncertain fate of the social media app as leverage against the Chinese
government as part of “his transactional approach to politics,” said
Emile Dirks, a researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen
Lab.</p>
<p>“Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods in
response to alleged Chinese inaction on fentanyl shipments to the United
States. He may treat the looming ban or forced sale of the social
networking service as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Beijing,”
Dirks told VOA by email.</p>
<p>Chander also said that TikTok holds geopolitical importance and
highlighted that the platform could even be used to ease strained
U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p>“While much of the attention has been focused on Trump’s tariff
strategy, the TikTok ban is part of what some are calling the ‘tech Cold
War’ between the two countries,” he said.</p>
<p>“If Trump can save TikTok in the United States, it would help ease
tensions between the two countries,” Chander added.</p>
<p>The president-elect’s promise to “save TikTok” might not be as simple
as his words suggest. Within the pool of his proposed Cabinet members is
a discordant stance on the validity and necessity of a TikTok ban.</p>
<p>Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s choice for director of national intelligence,
has over a million followers on TikTok, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his
choice for secretary of Health and Human Services, has more than 3
million followers. Both have publicly criticized legislation that would
force the sale of TikTok or impose a ban.</p>
<p>But Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, has
previously called for a complete ban on TikTok, describing it as a
“spyware” tool for China. Brendan Carr, Trump’s nominee for Federal
Communications Commission chairman, told Time magazine in November 2022
that he “can’t see a path forward without a ban” and that TikTok poses a
“huge national security risk.”</p>
<p>The variance in Republican attitudes toward TikTok reflects a broader
trend within the Republican stance toward China that will color the
foreign policy pursuits of the new administration, according to
Dirks.</p>
<p>“While some Republicans are foreign policy hawks who see Beijing as
the paramount threat facing the United States, others are America First
nationalists with little appetite for leveraging U.S. power to support
East Asian democracies like Taiwan. These two sides will jockey for
Trump’s support under his second presidency, much as they did under his
first term in office,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Still, despite the Biden administration’s imperative to change
American policy on TikTok, and Trump’s own attempts to ban the platform
and internal division, Chander said that Trump will most likely hold
true to his word to protect the social media platform.</p>
<p>“President Trump will not want to begin his term breaking his promise
to save TikTok. He will try to obtain some additional concessions from
TikTok about how they manage their algorithm and the data of U.S.
residents,” he said.</p>
<p>TikTok denies being controlled by or sharing data with the Chinese
government.</p>

id="trump-invites-chinas-xi-other-world-leaders-to-his-inauguration">Trump
invites China’s Xi, other world leaders to his inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi
Jinping and other foreign leaders to his January 20 inauguration, but it
is not known yet whether any of them plan to attend the ceremony on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News it was
yet “to be determined” whether Xi will accept Trump’s invitation, which
was extended in early November, shortly after Trump defeated Vice
President Kamala Harris for a new four-year term in the White House.</p>
<p>She did not name other world leaders who have been invited.
Typically, foreign ambassadors to Washington and other diplomats have
witnessed the peaceful quadrennial transfers of U.S. presidential power
but not heads of government. State Department records dating to 1874
show that no foreign leader has attended a U.S. presidential
inauguration.</p>
<p>But Leavitt said the invitations to the noontime outdoor ceremony in
six weeks are “an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue
with leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our
adversaries and our competitors, too. He is willing to talk to anyone,
and he will always put America’s interests first.”</p>
<p>If Xi travels to Washington, it could provide a first opportunity
during Trump’s second presidential term for the leaders of the world’s
two biggest economies to discuss contentious trade and military
issues.</p>
<p>Trump has threatened to impose massive tariffs on Chinese exports to
the United States, partly to push Beijing to curb the deadly flow of
fentanyl into the U.S. and to boost the sale of U.S. products in
China.</p>
<p>The U.S. has imposed a January 19 deadline, the eve of the
inauguration, for TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell
the social media app or face a ban in the U.S. TikTok is fighting the
ban in court; it lost a bid last week to block the ban but is appealing
the case to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Trump on Thursday, during an appearance at the New York Stock
Exchange, where he was ringing the bell to open the market, said he’s
been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration”
without referring to any specific individuals.</p>
<p>“And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump
said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But
we like to take little chances.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin separately on Thursday said President Vladimir Putin, at
war with U.S.-supported Ukraine for nearly three years, has not received
an inaugural invitation.</p>
<p>Since his election victory, Trump has met or talked with several
world leaders, including visits with Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President
Javier Milei, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida oceanside retreat.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron,
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Britian’s Prince William in
Paris last weekend at the reopening of the refurbished Notre Dame
Cathedral, much of which was gutted by a fire five years ago.</p>
<p>“World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because
they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through
American strength around the globe,” Leavitt said.</p>

<h2 id="meta-donates-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration-fund">Meta donates
$1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said
it has donated $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration
fund. </p>
<p>The donation comes just weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with
Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the
offering Thursday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street
Journal. </p>
<p>Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for
Trump’s second term, has said that Zuckerberg, like other business
leaders, wants to support Trump’s economic plans. The tech CEO has been
seeking to change his company’s perception on the right following a
rocky relationship with Trump. </p>
<p>Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on
the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023. </p>
<p>During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for
president but has voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier
this year, he praised Trump’s response to his first assassination
attempt. </p>
<p>Still, Trump had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly during the
campaign. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth
Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by
citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. “ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”
Trump wrote. </p>
<p>Corporations have traditionally made up a large share of donors to
presidential inaugurals, with an exception in 2009, when
then-President-elect Barack Obama refused to accept corporate donations.
He reversed course for his second inaugural in 2013. </p>
<p>Facebook did not donate to either Biden’s 2021 inaugural or Trump’s
2017 inaugural. </p>
<p>Google donated $285,000 each to Trump’s first inaugural and Biden’s
inaugural, according to Federal Election Commission records. Inaugural
committees are required to disclose the source of their fundraising, but
not how they spend the money. Microsoft gave $1 million to Obama’s
second inaugural, and $500,000 to Trump in 2017 and Biden in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="trump-is-named-times-person-of-the-year">Trump is named Time’s
Person of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — About six months ago, Donald Trump was sitting in a
courtroom in lower Manhattan listening to a jury make him the first
former president convicted of a crime. </p>
<p>On Thursday, he will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock
Exchange just blocks from that courthouse and as he was recognized by
Time magazine as its person of the year. </p>
<p>The honors for the businessman-turned-politician represent the latest
chapter in his love-hate relationship with New York. They’re also a
measure of Trump’s remarkable comeback from an ostracized former
president who refused to accept his election loss four years ago to a
president-elect who won the White House decisively in November. </p>
<p>Sam Jacobs, Time’s editor in chief, announced on NBC’s “Today” show
on Thursday morning that Trump was Time’s 2024 Person of the Year.
Jacobs said Trump was someone who “for better or for worse, had the most
influence on the news in 2024.” </p>
<p>Trump is expected to be on Wall Street to mark the ceremonial start
of the day’s trading, according to four people with knowledge of his
plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke
to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Trump was also Time’s Person of the Year in 2016, when he was first
elected to the White House. He was listed as a finalist for this year’s
award alongside notables including Vice President Kamala Harris, X owner
Elon Musk, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate, the
Princess of Wales. </p>
<p>The NYSE regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to
participate in the 9:30 a.m. ceremonial opening trading. Thursday will
be Trump’s first time doing the honors, which have become a marker of
culture and politics. </p>
<p>Last year, Time CEO Jessica Sibley rang the NYSE opening bell to
unveil the magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year: Taylor Swift. </p>
<p>During Trump’s first term, his wife, Melania Trump, rang the bell to
promote her “Be Best” initiative on children’s well-being. </p>
<p>Donald Trump’s trip to New York from his adopted home of Florida to
sound the call of capitalism in the mecca of finance tops a string of
visits that the former president has made to various spots in the city
this year. </p>
<p>Outside of his required presence in a downtown courthouse for his
trial, Trump, who is always attuned to the art of a photo op, held
campaign events around the city: at a firehouse, a bodega and a
construction site. He also held a rally in the Bronx, among the places
in the city where Trump made inroads during the election. </p>
<p>To mark the final stretch of his campaign, he held a high-octane
rally at Madison Square Garden, which drew immediate blowback after
speakers there made rude and racist insults and incendiary remarks. </p>
<p>Trump has long had a fascination with being on the cover of Time,
where he first made an appearance in 1989. He has falsely claimed to
hold the record for cover appearances, and The Washington Post reported
in 2017 that Trump had a fake picture of himself on the cover of the
magazine hanging in several of his golf country clubs. </p>
<p>Trump crafted his image as a wealthy real estate developer, which he
played up as the star of the TV reality show “The Apprentice” and during
his presidential campaign. He won the election in part by channeling
Americans’ anxieties about the economy’s ability to provide for the
middle class. </p>
<p>After the Nov. 5 election, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best
day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508
points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes
topped records they had set in previous weeks. </p>
<p>Trump, who often regards the stock market as a measure of public
support, has said his coming term as president should be dated to the
day after the election so he is credited for the gains. </p>
<p>Trump’s campaign promises have included pledges to deliver historic
levels of economic growth, and the people he’s selecting to fill out his
incoming administration skew heavily from the business sector. </p>
<p>The larger business community has applauded his promises to reduce
corporate taxes and cut regulations. But there are also concerns about
his stated plans to impose broad tariffs and possibly target companies
that he sees as not aligning with his own political interests. </p>
<p>The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of
which party wins the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average
gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the
winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are
adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates
and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. </p>
<p>In light of his election win, his lawyers have sought to have his
conviction in the Manhattan case be thrown out.</p>

ExxonMobil announced Wednesday that it plans to “generate low-carbon
electricity for data centers in the United States” by building natural
gas-fueled power plants outfitted with carbon capture and storage
technology to supply “behind-the-meter” electricity, unconnected from
the grid. Staying off the grid will help the company avoid making costly
transmission upgrades, meaning the generation capacity “can be installed
at a pace that other alternatives, including U.S. nuclear power, cannot

commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest
single-day act of clemency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of
roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home
confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39
Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. It’s the largest single-day
act of clemency in modern history. </p>
<p>The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served
out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were
released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some
inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5
prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated
Press. </p>
<p>Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would
continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act
of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office
in 2017. </p>
<p>“America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,”
Biden said in a statement. “As president, I have the great privilege of
extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and
rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in
daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to
remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially
those convicted of drug offenses.” </p>
<p>The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was
prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden is under pressure from advocacy
groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal
death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. He’s
also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who
investigated Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020
presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes
office. </p>
<p>Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such
as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers
said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during
natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction
counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular
biosciences; and a decorated military veteran. </p>
<p>The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other
pardons. He’s also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple
possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of
Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of
violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex. </p>
<p>Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and 34 other lawmakers are urging the
president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven
Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years
because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing
Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron. </p>
<p>Others are advocating for Biden to commute the sentences of federal
death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused
federal executions. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he
wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump
coming back into office, it’s likely executions will resume. During his
first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal
executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic. </p>
<p>More pardons are coming before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but
it’s not clear whether he’ll take action to guard against possible
prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power. The president has
been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as
much as six months — before the presidential election — but has been
concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar
with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity to discuss internal discussions. </p>
<p>But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New
California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was the chairman of the congressional
committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a
pardon from Biden would be “unnecessary,” and that the president
shouldn’t be spending his waning days in office worrying about
this. </p>
<p>A president has the power to both pardon, in which a person is
relieved of guilt and punishment, or commute a sentence, which reduces
or eliminates the punishment but doesn’t exonerate the wrongdoing. It’s
customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using
the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms. </p>
<p>Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so.
He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had
been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice
advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the
administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasn’t
a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his
decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research.</p>

id="new-data-finds-fewer-us-grandparents-are-taking-care-of-grandchildren">New
data finds fewer US grandparents are taking care of grandchildren</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fewer grandparents were living with and taking care of grandchildren,
there was a decline in young children going to preschool and more people
stayed put in their homes in the first part of the 2020s compared to the
last part of the 2010s, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released
Thursday, reflecting some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the most comprehensive survey of American
life compares the years of 2014-18 and 2019-23, timeframes before the
COVID-19 pandemic and during the virus’ spread. The American Community
Survey data show how lives were changed and family relationships altered
by the pandemic and other occurrences like the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>The survey of 3.5 million households covers more than 40 topics,
including ancestry, fertility, marital status, commutes, veterans
status, disability and housing.</p>
<p>The decrease in grandparents’ taking care of their grandchildren is
most likely the result of a decline in opioid-related deaths during the
more recent timeframe since substance abuse is a leading reason that
grandparents find themselves raising grandchildren. A reduction in the
number of incarcerated women also likely played a role, said Susan
Kelley, a professor emerita of nursing at Georgia State University.</p>
<p>“It’s very rarely for positive reasons that grandparents find
themselves in this situation. Usually, it’s a tragic situation in an
adult child’s life, either a death, incarceration or mental health
issues which correlate with substance abuse,” Kelly said. “Many
grandparents thrive in that role, but there are still socioeconomic and
emotional burdens on the grandparents.”</p>
<p>A stronger economy in the most recent period also may be a reason
that the number of grandparents living with their grandchildren declined
from 7.2 million to 6.8 million by making it less likely that adult
children with their own children were seeking housing help from their
parents, she said.</p>
<p>The decline in the number of young children enrolled in preschool
stemmed from an unwillingness to send young children to school and the
closure of many schools at the height of the pandemic, according to the
Census Bureau.</p>
<p>“These data show how the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact
on patterns of early childhood education,” the bureau said in a separate
report. “Future research will show if this was the start of a long-term
trend or if enrollment will bounce back to prior levels.”</p>
<p>Americans continued to get older, with the median age rising to 38.7
from 37.9 and the nation’s share of senior citizens up from 16.8% from
15.2%. The share of households with a computer jumped to almost 95% from
almost 89%, as did the share of households with a broadband connection
to almost 90% from 80%.</p>
<p>Additionally, fewer people moved and more people stayed put in the
most recent time period compared to the earlier one, in many cases
because of rising home values and the limited availability of homes to
buy.</p>
<p>Home values increased by 21.7% and the percentage of vacant homes
dropped from 12.2% to 10.4%. The median home value jumped from $249,400
to $303,400 nationwide.</p>
<p>In some vacation communities popular with the wealthy, the bump was
even more dramatic, such as in the county that is home to Aspen,
Colorado, where it went from $758,800 to $1.1 million, and in the county
which is home to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, where it jumped
from $812,400 to $1.1 million.</p>

signals conditional support for future government in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Following the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
government, the Biden administration said it would fully support a
transparent and inclusive transition process toward a nonsectarian
government accountable to the Syrian people.</p>
<p>“The transition process and new government must also uphold clear
commitments to fully respect the rights of minorities, facilitate the
flow of humanitarian assistance to all in need, prevent Syria from being
used as a base for terrorism or posing a threat to its neighbors, and
ensure that any chemical or biological weapons stockpiles are secured
and safely destroyed,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a
statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. recognition of a new government in Damascus could lead to the
lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Syrian economy. It’s an
incentive the Biden administration can leverage at a moment when the
country’s future is deeply uncertain.</p>
<p>“What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is governance
that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable, that meets
the aspirations of the Syrian people,” White House national security
communications adviser John Kirby said in an interview Tuesday with VOA.
It has to be “the product of a Syrian-led process.”</p>
<p>Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebels who toppled Assad, is a
U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group. Its leader, Abu Mohammed
al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head.</p>
<p>“This victory, my brothers, is a new chapter in the history of the
entire Islamic nation,” he said in his first speech since his fighters
rapidly took control of the country.</p>
<p>“It is a turning point for the region,” he said, singling out Iran —
a message he knows will be received well in Israel and the U.S. “He
[Assad] handed Syria over to Iranian ambitions, spreading sectarianism
and corruption throughout the country.”</p>
<p>Jolani pledged in a statement Tuesday to “hold accountable” members
of Assad’s regime who were “involved in torturing the Syrian
people.”</p>
<p>In recent years, he has espoused sectarian tolerance and distanced
himself from extremist ideology. He has sought to reassure Syria’s
ethnic and religious minorities, which include Christians, Kurds, Druze
and the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family
originates.</p>
<p>But by delivering his victory speech not from the presidential palace
but from the Great Mosque of Umayyad in Damascus — built in the eighth
century by a Sunni caliphate —Golani is sending a message to the region
about his majoritarian movement.</p>
<p>His speech mirrors that of Islamic State’s first caliph, Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi, at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul in 2014, Michael
Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“On the rebels’ own Telegram channel, there were statements saying,
‘We’ve taken the Umayyad Mosque. Next, we’re going to go for Al-Aqsa,’
which is in Jerusalem, of course. ‘Then, we’re going to go for the
Kaaba,’ which is in Saudi Arabia,” Rubin said.</p>
<p>US involvement</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has moved quickly, sending Blinken to Turkey and
Jordan Wednesday to consult with leaders after ordering more than 70
airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Syria on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The United States will work with our partners and stakeholders in
Syria to help them seize an opportunity to manage the risks,” Biden
said.</p>
<p>But on January 20, 2025, Biden will be replaced by President-elect
Donald Trump, who is signaling that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the
Syrian conflict.</p>
<p>“This is not our fight,” Trump said on social media. “Let it play
out. Do not get involved!”</p>
<p>But the U.S. is already involved. It has about 900 troops deployed in
Syria and backs a Syrian Kurdish rebel group. Washington also has close
ties with all of Syria’s neighbors — Iraq, Lebanon, as well as allies
Israel and Jordan, and NATO ally Turkey.</p>
<p>“They are directly impacted by what happens in Syria, and they are
also in a position to influence what happens in Syria, for better or for
worse,” said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, Iraq and
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“Don’t disengage completely, certainly not,” he told VOA. “But if you
don’t want to be overly engaged yourself, the United States of America,
this is the time to work very closely with partners around the
region.”</p>
<p>Under Trump’s “America First” doctrine, it’s unclear whether the U.S.
would aim its diplomatic efforts toward what Biden wants — a future
Syrian government that’s inclusive and nonsectarian.</p>
<p>Stakeholders make moves</p>
<p>Meanwhile, aside from the U.S., Israel and Turkey have bombed Syrian
targets to protect their interests.</p>
<p>Israel has launched hundreds of strikes on military targets to
further weaken what remains of the military of Tehran’s once-stalwart
ally and keep weapons from falling into extremists’ hands.</p>
<p>In northern Syria, rebel groups supported by Turkey attacked
U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, who Ankara sees as allies of a separatist
movement and displacing Syrian Kurds.</p>
<p>For now, Assad’s ally, Tehran, has lost much of its leverage.
Weakened by the defeat of its proxies in Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas
in Gaza, it may employ pragmatism in dealing with Damascus.</p>
<p>“The Iranian foreign minister has talked about the new Syrians as the
victory of the opposition, whereas in the past, they wouldn’t legitimize
them as opposition. They spoke of them instead as terrorists,” Rubin
said, a signal that Tehran is weighing whether it can work with the
incoming government.</p>
<p>Russia, another Assad backer who has provided asylum for the
embattled leader and his family, is lobbying to keep its two military
bases in Syria. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said
Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia’s future
military presence.</p>
<p>Mohammed al-Bashir, Syria’s newly appointed caretaker prime minister
who previously led the rebels’ civilian government, will run a
transitional government until March 1, 2025, he said in remarks on
Tuesday.</p>

Iranian drone ‘mothership’ off the United States, Pentagon says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday flatly dismissed claims by a
U.S. lawmaker that Iran might be launching drones over New Jersey from a
“mothership” off the East Coast. </p>
<p>“There is no truth to that,” said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina
Singh. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and
there’s no so-called ‘mothership’ launching drones towards the United
States.” </p>
<p>Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, whose district in New Jersey
includes Atlantic City, said he had uncovered what appeared to be an
Iranian plot. </p>
<p>“What we’ve uncovered is alarming — drones flying in from the
direction of the ocean, possibly linked to a missing Iranian
mothership,” he said on social media platform X. </p>
<p>The lawmaker also made the claims on Fox News. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it began receiving
reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Nov. 18.
The FAA has barred drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base
and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. </p>
<p>Last week, the FBI and New Jersey State Police asked the public to
report any information related to the recent sightings of possible
drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River. </p>
<p>“Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a
possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law
enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI said. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not
from another country and that the U.S. military had not shot them down
because they did not pose a threat to any military installations. </p>
<p>“We have no evidence that these activities are coming from a foreign
entity or the work of an adversary,” Singh said. </p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to monitor what is happening. But, you know,
at no point were our installations threatened when this activity was
occurring.” </p>
<p>Still, the latest drone sightings are a reminder of the growing
concern about a proliferation of drone technology and the potential
security considerations, given that drones can carry surveillance
technology or even explosives. </p>
<p>At a press conference, House of Representatives Democratic Leader
Hakeem Jeffries was asked about the lack of information about the
drones. </p>
<p>“We need a greater degree of transparency from law enforcement
authorities, and we will make sure that happens in the days and weeks to
come,” Jeffries said.</p>

judge orders CIA analyst accused of Israel-Iran leak held pending
trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A CIA analyst charged with leaking top-secret
details ahead of a planned Israeli attack on Iran earlier this year will
remain jailed pending trial, a judge ordered Wednesday. </p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles overruled a
magistrate who said last week that Asif Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia,
could be free on restrictions while he awaited trial on charges of
disclosing national defense information. </p>
<p>The fight over Rahman’s detention revealed additional details about
the government’s investigation of the leak and the analyst who allegedly
disclosed the classified documents in October on the Telegram messaging
app. </p>
<p>At Wednesday’s detention hearing, prosecutor Troy Edwards said Rahman
was motivated by ideology, though he did not discuss what that ideology
might be. </p>
<p>In fact, he said the conclusion that Rahman’s motive was ideological
was essentially the result of the process of elimination, noting that
Rahman comes from a wealthy family and has access to a
multimillion-dollar family trust, and therefore wouldn’t have a
financial incentive. </p>
<p>Edwards also highlighted eight pages of notes found on Rahman when he
was arrested last month in Cambodia, where he worked at the U.S. Embassy
in Phnom Penh. Those notes included two separate “to-do” lists, one of
which was largely blocks of apparently encrypted text along with an
unencrypted sentence pertaining to U.S. missile capabilities. Edwards
said investigators have not yet been able to decipher the
encryption. </p>
<p>A separate, unencrypted to-do list included categories labeled
“contingencies” and “run,” Edwards said. </p>
<p>Official court documents are vague about what was leaked, but details
discussed in open court made clear that the material references an
October disclosure of documents from the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, noting that
Israel was moving military assets into place to conduct a military
strike on Iran after Iran launched its own missile attack on Israel on
October 1. </p>
<p>Israel ended up carrying out an attack on Iran’s air defense systems
and missile manufacturing facilities in late October. </p>
<p>In court papers, the government said the leak caused Israel to delay
its attack plans. Edwards said the volatile nature of the Middle East
made the leak exceptionally dangerous. </p>
<p>“It is hard to overstate what other circumstances present graver
risks of danger to human life than unilaterally deciding” to transmit
information related to plans for “kinetic military action between two
countries,” prosecutors wrote in court papers. </p>
<p>Rahman’s attorney, Amy Jeffress, cited anonymous sources in news
articles who have downplayed the leak’s significance. </p>
<p>Jeffress said the to-do list included the word “run” because Rahman
is an avid jogger. She also said it’s rare for defendants facing similar
charges to be detained pending trial. </p>
<p>Rahman was born in California and moved with his family when he was a
child to Cincinnati, where he was a high school valedictorian, according
to court papers submitted by his lawyer. He went to Yale University and
graduated in three years. He and his wife now live in the D.C. metro
area, along with his parents. </p>
<p>His father, Muhit Rahman, who was prepared to serve as his son’s
custodian pretrial if he had been released, attended Wednesday’s hearing
along with numerous family members and friends in support. </p>
<p>Rahman made his initial court appearance last month in Guam. </p>
<p>Jeffress said after Wednesday’s hearing that she intended to appeal
the detention order.</p>

Climate tech investors have a lot to take stock of at the end of 2024.
The macroeconomic environment is shaky and investment in the space

of cash reserves lying in wait</u></a>. Artificial intelligence and its
attendant data center power demand
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>may</u></a>
or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_self"><u>may
not</u></a> be the downfall of a future clean electric grid. And in case
you missed it, Donald Trump was elected once more, this time drawing the
world’s most successful — and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/musk-trump-tesla-tax-credits" target="_self"><u>notorious</u></a>
— climate tech CEO into his fold.
</p>
<p>
This week I spoke with two veterans of the industry about all these
trends and more — Andrew Beebe, managing director of the venture capital
firm Obvious Ventures, which has over $1 billion in assets under
management, and Scott Jacobs, co-founder and CEO of the comparably huge
sustainable infrastructure investment firm Generate Capital, which has
raised over $10 billion to date. And while Beebe sounded jazzed about
the year to come, Jacobs struck a more downbeat note as he delved into
the difficult realities that climate companies are facing.
</p>
<h3>
The Past
</h3>
<p>
Beebe reflected positively on 2024 as a whole, though he is historically
both an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vc-ai-climate-change" target="_self"><u>optimist
and a contrarian</u></a>. Venture funds spent this year accumulating
capital, a.k.a. “dry powder,” although that doesn’t mean investment into
climate tech <em><em>companies</em></em> has actually increased.
</p>
<p>
“Those investors are now going to be very prudent and judicious with
their capital,” Beebe told me, emphasizing that we’re likely already
seeing the impact of this circumspect approach. Climate tech investment
has declined sharply from its peak in 2021 and 2022, when many experts
believe the market was running too hot. Though he didn’t have the
numbers on hand to back it up, Beebe told me he suspects investors are
sitting on more cash now than they were three years ago.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs, on the other hand, sounded passionate but weary as he mulled
over the past year. “This year is a lot like the 10 years we’ve been in
business in many ways, which is tough,” he told me. Based on numbers
alone, Generate had a successful 2024, raising $1.5 billion from
institutional investors and $1.2 billion in flexible loans while making
$2 billion in investments. But Jacobs emphasized that the type of
flexible, large-scale infrastructure funding that Generate specializes
in is always going to be a grind. As he explained to me, getting limited
partners to invest in Generate for the long-haul has been a perpetual
challenge and the capital costs of running the firm are high, thanks
partly to the labor needs of operating and maintaining infrastructure
projects.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs didn’t say this year was any more challenging than normal, simply
that Generate’s fundamental model is an all-too-necessary but heavy
lift. While a typical VC like Obvious might fund a series of early-stage
companies in exchange for equity that could pay off big in a few years,
Generate’s paradigm is much more hands on, as it involves owning and
operating many of the projects it finances, raising so-called “permanent
capital” from LPs that allows it to manage assets indefinitely, and
deploying a variety of customized project financing options for its
partners.
</p>
<p>
“I think we’re all very comfortable with the grittiness that is
necessary to be sustainable infrastructure investors and operators, but
it does tire you out,” Jacobs said. And he doesn’t see an end to the
noble slog.
</p>
<h3>
The Future
</h3>
<p>
Ultimately though, Jacobs doesn’t think that Generate and its partners
are particularly at risk in this uncertain political and economic
moment. A
<a href="https://intelligence.generatecapital.com/investors-and-banks-are-voting-for-the-infrastructure-transition-with-their-dollars/" target="_blank"><u>policy
outlook</u></a> that the firm published last month stated, “We do not
expect the funding environment for sustainable infrastructure projects
to be imperiled now that the market is experiencing more headwinds.
Rather, we anticipate a flight to quality.” But Jacobs is far more
pessimistic about the rest of the climate tech ecosystem. Like many
investors that I’ve talked with lately, Jacobs referenced a famous
Warren Buffett quote to characterize this moment: “You don’t find out
who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out.”
</p>
<p>
With investors pulling back and startups taking longer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/missing-middle" target="_self"><u>to
raise growth funding</u></a>, Jacobs thinks lots of companies will soon
find themselves exposed, even if they don’t know it yet. “I continue to
be surprised by the optimism bias in our space,” he told me. While he
understands that optimism is “inherent to survival” when standing up
companies that aim to address the climate crisis, he thinks many of his
peers are ignoring clear negative signals.
</p>
<p>
“It’s less about the election and more just about the last three years
of performance and the last three years of capital flows,” Jacobs said.
That is, while another Trump term will likely bode poorly for many
startups and investors, climate tech companies are also facing a series
of unrelated headwinds that have contributed to falling investment and
fewer exit events, including inflation,high interest rates, geopolitical
instability, and China’s flooding of the market with cheap tech.
</p>
<p>
“Northvolt’s bankruptcy, I think, is the first big shoe to drop,” Jacobs
told me. “But there could be as many as a dozen more of those that are
really high profile climate tech flame-outs that make it seem like we
learned no lessons from the first big flame-out” of the early 2010s, of
which Solyndra is the most infamous example. That bubble burst as
investors failed to grasp the complexity and longer timelines associated
with climate tech and backed technologies that lacked a clear path to
commercial viability or profitability. This time around, Jacobs told me,
“It’s going to be really hard to separate the signal from the noise. And
the noise will be very negative.”
</p>
<p>
Beebe, unsurprisingly, had a more optimistic take on the year to come.
As we chatted about how the Trump and Elon Musk duo is prioritizing (at
least rhetorically) cutting through red tape to deploy energy projects
more expeditiously, a potential upside of the new administration, Beebe
jumped in with an even riskier prediction.
</p>
<p>
“I think that we will see a meaningful number of Republicans in the
Senate and the House start to champion climate solutions and sort of
attempt to make climate resiliency and fighting climate change more of a
Republican issue,” he told me. Like many an optimist before him, Beebe
cited
<a href="https://garbarino.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/garbarino.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/FINAL%20Credits%20Letter%202024.08.06.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
letter</u></a> signed by 18 Republicans from the House of
Representatives asking speaker Mike Johnson to preserve the Inflation
Reduction Act’s energy tax credits as evidence that Republicans are
getting on board with the energy transition, although
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-republicans-ira" target="_self"><u>a
number of the signatories</u></a> have since lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
“Nixon created the EPA. Teddy Roosevelt was a real conservationist.
They’re called the conservatives — they like to conserve things,
including natural resources. And that has been a hallmark for at least a
century — a century-and-a-half — of that party,” Beebe explained. When
pro-Trump investors such as Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz use terms
like
“<a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism/#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>American
dynamism</u></a>,” what he hears “through the fog machines of those
kinds of phrases” is a discussion about American competitiveness, which
inherently includes a strong, sustainability-oriented energy policy.
</p>
<p>
Nuclear fission, in particular, looks like a prime target for
investment, Beebe told me. He has been happily surprised to see the
upswell in bipartisan support for the re-opening and buildout of new
reactors, categorizing Microsoft’s effort to restart Three Mile Island
as a “watershed event of 2024.” Now, Obvious is open to funding small
modular reactors and next-generation nuclear fission tech, which it
hadn’t considered before.
</p>
<h3>
The Present
</h3>
<p>
If you are feeling emotionally torn after all this, well, same. There
were of course points of more neutral overlap between the two investors
— both think the power demands of AI simultaneously pose a daunting
challenge and a major opportunity to drive deployment of clean, firm
energy, and both agree that the climate tech world will soldier on,
buoyed by state and local support, regardless of what happens in the
White House.
</p>
<p>
But ultimately, are we poised for a grueling year of climate tech
contraction and insolvency? Or a year where investors wisely deploy
capital in an environment of emerging bipartisan consensus? Perhaps some
of both? As Jacobs told me, regardless of what investors think, the next
year, four years, and beyond will be driven first and foremost by
customer demand for decarbonization, resilience, and cost savings.
</p>
<p>
“That is what drives the transition. It’s not financiers who drive it.
It’s not technologists who drive it. It’s not even policy makers who
drive it. It’s people who want something, they have a problem to solve.
And if we solve that problem for them, we tend to get paid.”

Activists Take America’s Newest ‘Fuel Choice’ Law to Court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI5MTE0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDI1MTAxOH0.p4G6o3cCJ1yUhQFTALHp4-2nCxkxGSsxIflV5zjuRGA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The United States is rapidly dividing into two camps: those that are
trying to move away from using natural gas in buildings to fight climate
change, and those passing “fuel choice” laws that protect consumers’
rights to keep burning it. On election day, Washington State flipped
from the former to the latter as voters narrowly approved a ballot
measure that overturned some of the most ambitious decarbonization
policies in the country.
</p>
<p>
Now, a coalition of local governments, environmental groups, and public
health advocates are challenging that ballot measure in court, arguing
that voters didn’t understand what they were signing up for, and thus
that the measure violates parts of the Washington State constitution
designed to prevent abuse at the ballot box.
</p>
<p>
“Among its far-reaching impacts,” the opening of the claim filed at the
King County Superior Court on Wednesday reads, “the Initiative
jeopardizes the ability of local governments and other entities to
establish energy-efficiency standards and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions; it threatens programs that require the construction of energy
efficient buildings; and it would make the clean energy transition
chaotic and more expensive for Washingtonians.”
</p>
<p>
Initiative 2066 was pitched by its sponsor, the Building Industry
Association of Washington, as simply a measure to protect consumer
access to natural gas, according to Kai Smith, a lawyer from Pacifica
Law Group who is representing the plaintiffs. But the text of the
measure goes much further, he said, affecting several state laws and
codes designed to reduce carbon emissions and regulate air pollution.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think voters would have been aware of that broad of an impact
when they looked at the ballot title and they heard the campaign
messaging,” Smith told me.
</p>
<p>
Though Washington has long been a leading state for climate policy, it
began taking bigger swings at decarbonizing buildings, in particular, in
2022. That year, the state’s building code council enacted energy codes
that required newly constructed buildings to be outfitted with
all-electric space heating and hot water systems. The council later
amended the rules so that they strongly encouraged — but did not
necessarily require — electric appliances after a similar policy in
Berkeley, California was overturned by a federal court.
</p>
<p>
Initiative 2066 invalidates those codes. It also repeals key parts of a
law the state legislature passed earlier this year that requires
Washington’s biggest utility, Puget Sound Energy, to consider
alternatives before replacing aging gas infrastructure or building new
gas pipelines. The utility would have had to analyze whether
electrifying the homes served by that infrastructure instead would
ultimately save ratepayers money.
</p>
<p>
That’s not all: In a more forward-looking section, the initiative bans
counties and local governments from passing any local ordinances that
“prohibit, penalize, or discourage” the use of gas in buildings. It also
adds a new clause to the Clean Air Act barring state officials from
doing the same.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit was brought by Climate Solutions, a local climate advocacy
group, as well as Washington Conservation Action, Front and Centered,
the Washington Solar Energy Industries Association, King County, and the
City Of Seattle. It alleges that the measure violates the state’s
“single subject” and “subject-in-title” rules, which say that an act can
only concern one topic and that the ballot title has to fairly and
accurately apprise voters of the content of the initiative.
</p>
<p>
Although all the pieces of Initiative 2066 are related to protecting
consumers’ access to natural gas as an energy source, Smith argued that
some of the changes it makes are more broad — for example, sticking a
clause in the Clean Air Act to protect natural gas use. The Clean Air
Act is about pollution regulations, he said. “While those are tied to
natural gas, conceptually and legally, I think they are distinct.” The
Initiative also struck a provision in Washington law that required the
state’s building code council, as it updates energy codes periodically,
to work toward a goal of all new construction being “zero fossil-fuel
greenhouse gas emission” by 2031. That strike-out would impact the full
range of fossil fuels, not just natural gas, Smith said.
</p>
<p>
Climate policy in Washington is popular. The majority of voters rejected
another measure on the ballot which would have repealed the state’s big
umbrella climate law that puts a declining cap on emissions. But perhaps
some of those voters haven’t yet made the connection that cutting carbon
includes the emissions that come from their homes. The natural gas
burned in homes and buildings are responsible for 25% of the state’s
carbon footprint. Clearly, the “yes on I-2066” campaign’s
<a href="https://letsgowashington.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>messaging</u></a>
— summed up as “stop the gas ban” — resonated.
</p>
<p>
Smith argued that the message was misleading. “That’s not what these
laws are,” he said. “It’s to help facilitate movement towards clean
energy in a way that’s thoughtful and methodical, and that doesn’t lead
to increased costs for customers.”

communities in a rural western county.</p>
<p>The complaint filed in Maricopa County Superior Court alleges that
the pumping at a Fondomonte Arizona, LLC. alfalfa farm has had
widespread effects in the Ranegras Plain Basin of La Paz County, harming
everyone who depends on basin water by drawing down supplies, drying up
wells and causing the ground to crack and sink in some areas.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the latest action by Arizona against foreign companies
that use huge amounts of groundwater to grow thirsty forage crops for
export because of climate challenges in other countries. Rural Arizona
is especially attractive to international businesses because it has no
groundwater pumping regulations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that since 2014, Fondomonte has extracted huge
amounts that accelerated depletion of the basin’s aquifer.</p>
<p>The Associated Press called and emailed Fondomonte Arizona, a
subsidiary of Saudi Dairy giant Almarai Co., seeking a response to the
lawsuit Wednesday. Its lawyers have previously said that the company
legally leased and purchased land in the U.S. and spent millions on
infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>Years of drought have increased pressure on water users across the
West, particularly in states like Arizona, which relies heavily on the
dwindling Colorado River. The drought has also made groundwater — long
used by farmers and rural residents without restriction — even more
important for users across the state.</p>
<p>Mayes’ lawsuit alleges that Fondomonte’s actions are a public
nuisance under a state statute that prohibits activity that injures
health, obstructs property use or interferes with the comfortable
enjoyment of life or property by a community.</p>
<p>Mayes called the company’s groundwater pumping “unsustainable” and
said it caused “devastating consequences” for people in the area.</p>
<p>“Arizona law is clear: No company has the right to endanger an entire
community’s health and safety for its own gain,” she said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the company from further groundwater
pumping it says is “excessive” and require that an abatement fund be
established.</p>
<p>Arizona officials have been targeting Fondomonte for more than a year
over its use of groundwater to grow forage crops, by not renewing or
canceling the company’s leases in Butler Valley in western Arizona. Some
residents there had complained that the company’s pumping was
threatening their wells.</p>

Malibu remains under threat of flames, thousands evacuated</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — A fire continued to spread Wednesday in Malibu,
a posh Californian city popular with celebrities, where thousands of
people were evacuated as firefighters battled wind-fanned flames to save
threatened homes.</p>
<p>About 4,000 acres and at least seven properties, authorities said,
have gone up in smoke since the Franklin Fire broke out Monday night on
the hills above Pepperdine University. </p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, firefighters had contained the fire by 7%,
firefighters said. </p>
<p>The fire’s intensity has decreased to the east and north, but the
flames have strengthened to the west overnight, Los Angeles County Fire
Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday, warning that the area is not out
of danger.   </p>
<p>“Weather conditions, including strong winds and low humidity, will be
closely monitored today as they play a key role in the evolution of the
fire,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>The resulting red alert should be maintained for a good part of the
day, estimates the local official.  </p>
<p>About 20,000 people were under evacuation orders or alerts Tuesday
asking them to prepare to evacuate, according to the Los Angeles County
Sheriff’s Department. </p>
<p>Among the evacuees was former movie star Dick Van Dyke, 99, best
known for his role in Mary Poppins (1964): “Arlene [his wife] and I have
safely evacuated our animals, except for one cat that escaped as we were
leaving. We pray that he will survive and that our community will
survive these terrible fires,” he wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. </p>
<p>More than 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze, supported by a
fleet of water-bombing aircraft. </p>
<p>After two rainy winters that gave it a relative respite, California
is experiencing a very active fire season this year. In July through
August, the state suffered the fourth largest fire in its history. </p>
<p>Scientists believe that increasingly intense heat waves and droughts
are fueling forest fires and are consequences of climate change.</p>

id="biden-says-healthy-women-help-us-prosperity-as-he-highlights-white-house-initiative">Biden
says healthy women help US prosperity as he highlights White House
initiative</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he was “so
proud” that a women’s health research initiative he launched last year
at his wife’s urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a
healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity. </p>
<p>“That’s a fact,” he said in closing remarks at the first White House
Conference on Women’s Health Research. “We haven’t gotten that through
to the other team yet,” Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald
Trump and his incoming administration. </p>
<p>Trump’s three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his
first term as president voted to overturn a woman’s constitutional right
to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women’s
health issues in this year’s elections. </p>
<p>Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, said
the president-elect would keep his promise to improve health in the
U.S. </p>
<p>“President Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL
Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on
that promise,” Leavitt said in an email. </p>
<p>Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people,
but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely
been underfunded and understudied, officials have said. </p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White
House Initiative on Women’s Health Research to the president after Maria
Shriver, herself a women’s health advocate and member of the influential
Kennedy political family, brought it to her. </p>
<p>The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and
philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she would keep
pressing the issue. </p>
<p>“My work doesn’t stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,”
she said. “I will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us
here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative
research.” </p>
<p>Jill Biden said the U.S. economy loses about $1.8 billion in working
time every year because of how menopause affects women. And she is
interested in learning more about extreme morning sickness during
pregnancy. </p>
<p>“I heard this a couple weeks ago and I was particularly interested
because my own granddaughter was going through the same thing, because
we’re going to be great-grandparents,” Jill Biden said. </p>
<p>Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal and her husband, Peter Neal, are
expecting their first child. </p>
<p>Since its launch, the women’s health research initiative has
attracted nearly $1 billion in federal funding, including from the
Defense Department and National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p>“In one year, everybody in this room kicked butt,” Shriver said at
the conference. “Not until the Bidens did anyone ever think to make
women’s health and research a priority for the federal government, so
let that sink in.” </p>
<p>President Biden closed the conference with a nod to the influence of
his wife, who, after her remarks, sat in the front row beside their
daughter, Ashley Biden, who runs a women’s shelter in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>’You stepped up, kid,” Biden told the first lady. Then he told the
audience, “In case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.”</p>

id="gun-found-on-suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-matches-shell-casings-at-scene-police-say">Gun
found on suspect in killing of US insurance CEO matches shell casings at
scene, police say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The gun found on the suspect in the killing
of United Healthcare’s CEO matched shell casings found at the site of
the shooting, New York City’s police commissioner said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Suspect Luigi Mangione’s fingerprints also matched a water bottle and
a protein bar wrapper that police found near the scene and say the
gunman purchased at a nearby coffee shop while awaiting his target,
Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an unrelated news conference.</p>
<p>Mangione, 26, was charged with murder in the shooting last week in
midtown Manhattan of Brian Thompson, who led the United States’ largest
medical insurance company.</p>
<p>Authorities have said that writings found in Mangione’s possession
hinted at a hatred of corporate greed.</p>
<p>They’ve recovered a spiral notebook that Mangione kept, along with a
three-page handwritten letter found when he was arrested, a law
enforcement official said Wednesday. Police have not disclosed what was
in the notebook.</p>
<p>The letter, found when Mangione was arrested Monday in Altoona,
Pennsylvania, teased the possibility that clues to the attack — “some
straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it” — could
be found in the notebook, the law enforcement official said. The
official wasn’t authorized to disclose information about the
investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>Kenny told CBS New York that the motive might have been related to an
accident that sent Mangione to an emergency room on July 4, 2023.</p>
<p>A law enforcement bulletin obtained by the AP earlier this week said
the letter expressed anger with what Mangione called “parasitic” health
insurance companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power. The
prep school and Ivy League graduate wrote that the U.S. has the most
expensive health care system in the world and that profits of major
corporations continue to rise while life expectancy doesn’t, according
to the bulletin.</p>
<p>In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione emerged from a
patrol car Tuesday shouting about an “insult to the intelligence of the
American people” while deputies pushed him into a courthouse.</p>
<p>Mangione remained jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was
initially charged with gun and forgery offenses.</p>
<p>Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring Mangione to New York. At
a brief hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey
said Mangione will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on
the issue.</p>
<p>“You can’t rush to judgment in this case or any case,” Dickey said
afterward. “He’s presumed innocent. Let’s not forget that.”</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370
kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald’s customer
recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.</p>
<p>New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying a gun like
the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the suspected shooter
had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and
other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan
hotel for an investor conference. From surveillance video, New York
investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by
bus.</p>
<p>His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took
steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at his Pennsylvania
hearing Tuesday that when arrested, he had bags for his cellphone and
laptop that prevent such devices from transmitting signals that
authorities can use to track them.</p>
<p>Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer
and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked
for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he
bunked at a “co-living” space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said
he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain.</p>
<p>His relatives have said in a statement that they are was “shocked and
devastated” at his arrest.</p>

kayaker who faked his death and fled to Eastern Europe has willingly
returned to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GREEN LAKE, WISCONSIN — A Wisconsin man who faked his own drowning
and left his wife and three children and was believed to have been in
Eastern Europe willingly returned to the U.S. after roughly four months
and is in custody, a sheriff said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ryan Borgwardt “came back on his own” because of his family, Green
Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll said during a brief news conference.</p>
<p>“We can stand here feeling relieved,” Podoll said.</p>
<p>Borgwardt, 45, landed Tuesday and was being held at the county jail
pending an afternoon court appearance. The sheriff said his office has
recommended a number of charges, including obstruction. A message
seeking information on potential charges was not immediately returned by
the county prosecutor.</p>
<p>Last month, Podoll said Borgwardt began communicating with
authorities on Nov. 11 after disappearing for three months but hadn’t
committed to returning to Wisconsin. Podoll said police were “pulling at
his heartstrings” to come home.</p>
<p>Podoll declined to say specifically where Borgwardt has been since he
disappeared and deflected a question about any conversations that may
have persuaded him to return.</p>
<p>“That’s going to be up to him someday. We’re not going to release
that. … We brought a dad back on his own,” Podoll said.</p>
<p>Podoll declined to discuss the details of Borgwardt’s return trip,
other than to say “he got on an airplane and landed in the U.S.” and
turned himself in at the Green Lake County Justice Center on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Borgwardt told authorities last month that he faked his death because
of “personal matters,” the sheriff said in November. He told them that
in mid-August he traveled about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from his home
in Watertown to Green Lake, where he overturned his kayak, dumped his
phone and then paddled an inflatable boat to shore. He said he picked
that lake because it’s the deepest in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>After leaving the lake, he rode an electric bike about 70 miles (110
kilometers) through the night to Madison. From there, he said he took a
bus to Detroit, then boarded a bus to Canada and got on a plane.</p>
<p>An analysis of a laptop — it was not clear whose — revealed a digital
trail that shows Borgwardt had planned to head to Europe and tried to
mislead investigators.</p>
<p>The laptop’s hard drive had been replaced and the browsers had been
cleared on the day Borgwardt disappeared, Podoll said in a news release
in November. Investigators found passport photos, inquiries about moving
funds to foreign banks and communication with a woman from Uzbekistan.
They also discovered that Borgwardt also took out a $375,000 life
insurance policy in January.</p>
<p>Law enforcement personnel made contact with Borgwardt on Nov. 11.</p>
<p>He sent them a video of himself wearing an orange T-shirt and not
smiling. He said in the video that he was in his apartment and briefly
panned the camera but mostly showed just a door and bare walls. He did
not say where he was.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office has said the search for Borgwardt’s body, which
lasted more than a month, cost at least $35,000. The sheriff said that
Borgwardt told authorities that he didn’t expect the search to last more
than two weeks.</p>

Director Wray says he plans to resign at end of Biden’s term in
January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday he intends
to resign at the end of President Joe Biden’s term in January, an
announcement that came a week and a half after President-elect Donald
Trump announced his intention to nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the
job.</p>
<p>At a town hall meeting with the bureau workforce, Wray said he would
be stepping down “after weeks of careful thought.”</p>
<p>Wray’s intended resignation is not unexpected considering that Trump
had picked Patel for the role in his new administration.</p>
<p>Wray had previously been named by Trump and began the 10-year term —
a length meant to insulate the agency from the political influence of
changing administrations — in 2017, after Trump fired then-FBI Director
James Comey.</p>
<p>Trump had telegraphed his anger with Wray on multiple occasions,
including after Wray’s congressional testimony in September. But the
soft-spoken director rarely seemed to go out of his way to publicly
confront the White House.</p>

security officials meet with lawmakers about mysterious drone
flights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in New Jersey huddled
with state and local lawmakers Wednesday to discuss the recent spate of
drone sightings throughout the state.</p>
<p>Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have
raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry
stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny
Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over
President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.</p>
<p>Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use,
but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration
regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA
certified.</p>
<p>Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger
than those typically used by hobbyists.</p>
<p>The number of sightings has increased in recent days, although
officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than
drones. It’s also possible that a single drone has been reported more
than once.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that
the drones don’t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been
investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or
other information they may have.</p>
<p>Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is
entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker
proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state.</p>
<p>“This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame
people for being frustrated,” Murphy said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Details about Wednesday’s meeting were not immediately disclosed. A
spokesperson for the Democratic governor said he was not attending.</p>
<p>Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts
of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other
legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for
about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton.</p>
<p>Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time but
appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings
reported have been confirmed to involve drones.</p>
<p>Who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from?
What are they doing? “My understanding is they have no clue,” Peterson
said.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment on Peterson’s remarks was left with the
Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some
were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton.
Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states, including the
New York City area, and over Pennsylvania’s Delaware County and
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>James Edwards of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few
drones flying over his neighborhood since last month.</p>
<p>“It raises concern mainly because there’s so much that’s unknown,”
Edwards said Wednesday. “There are lots of people spouting off about
various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only
adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is
really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.”</p>

id="zimbabwe-aims-to-end-hivaids-as-public-health-threat-by-2030">Zimbabwe
aims to end HIV/AIDS as public health threat by 2030</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MARONDERA, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwean health officials said Tuesday they
aim to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, crediting
the United States with making such progress possible through aid and
support.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont and officials from PEPFAR
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toured the HIV
services area at Marondera Hospital, located some 70 kilometers east of
Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, where HIV/AIDS once sickened
thousands.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists afterward, Dr. Delight Madoro, a district
medical officer in Mashonaland East province, said PEPFAR — or the U.S.
Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — enabled Zimbabwe to combat
the epidemic with strategies such as blood-based self-testing and PrEP,
which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis.</p>
<p>“And after maybe you test positive, there are staff and support … at
the facilities to help link you to other HIV services,” Madoro said.</p>
<p>“There is a lot that is happening on the ground in terms of [the]
fight against HIV through the support that we are getting from PEPFAR,”
he continued. “And in terms of human resources, we’re getting more
staff. This means our clients are going to have more time with
clinicians, so that we become thorough, and we get thorough with our
treatment.</p>
<p>“So, in a nutshell, I can say the support that we have been getting
from PEPFAR is of paramount importance,” he said.</p>
<p>Tremont said the U.S. was committed to help fight the HIV epidemic in
Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>“We’ve made huge progress since 2006,” she said. “The number of
deaths from HIV has fallen 80%, and that is something I think we should
all be very proud of.”</p>
<p>Tremont mentioned that the U.S. provided antiretroviral treatments
and many health care workers at clinics and hospitals around
Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see all that in action today and to see the dedication
and stubbornness of the health care workers reaching down to those HIV
patients who are scared and reluctant to undertake treatment,” she said.
“Thank you to the health care workers. You are our heroes in all
this.”</p>
<p>Haddi Cham, the Centers for Disease Control’s Zimbabwe HIV services
branch chief, said the PEPFAR program made the HIV facility at Marondera
Hospital possible.</p>
<p>“We have been supporting this facility for many, many years now, and
we are really grateful for the collaboration with all the key
stakeholders. Through that strong collaboration, we are able to realize
these results,” Cham said.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS, especially
before 1999, when authorities introduced an AIDS levy — a 3% tax on
income and business profits that is used by the National AIDS Council
for programs to combat the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Data indicate the prevalence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 49 in
Zimbabwe declined from 12.7% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2023.</p>

gas to generate a significant amount of high-reliability electricity for

permanent storage deep underground.” Going behind the meter means that
this generation “can be installed at a pace that other alternatives,
including U.S. nuclear power, cannot match,” the company
said.<br/><br/>The move represents a first for Exxon, which is famous
for its far-flung operations to extract and process oil and natural gas
but has not historically been in the business of supplying electricity
to customers. The company is looking to generate 1.5 gigawatts of power,
about 50% more than a large nuclear reactor, <em><em>The New York

</a>power industry has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>reached
an inflection point </u></a>thanks to new demand from data centers to
power artificial intelligence, electrification of transportation and
heating, and new manufacturing investment. The demand for new power is
immense, yet the industry’s ability to provide it quickly is limited
both by the intermittent nature of cheap renewable power like solar and
storage — plus the transmission capacity it requires — and by
the<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self">
<u>regulatory barriers and market uncertainty</u></a> around building

<u>said at a recent event hosted by the Atlantic Council</u></a>. “I
think what we’re likely to see is that gas turbine generation is going
to be a big part of the solution set, and a lot of it may be what’s
called behind the meter … to support data centers.”
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the so-called hyperscalers are still making massive
investments in renewables. Google, the investment firm TPG, and the
energy developer
Intersect<a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/new-approach-to-data-center-and-clean-energy-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat
<a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/infrastructure/new-approach-to-data-center-and-clean-energy-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
in a company blog post</u></a> on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
While Google was a pioneer in developing new renewable power to offset
emissions from its operations and recently formed a partnership with
Microsoft and the steel company Nucor to
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/microsoft-google-nucor-clean-firm-power-advanced-nuclear-geothermal-long-duration-storage/711050/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>foster

project will be focused on “co-locating grid-connected carbon-free
energy and data center investments into closely-linked infrastructure
projects.”
</p>
<p>
These projects — the data centers and the clean power generation — would
be sited <em><em>close</em></em> to each other, however they would not
be behind the meter, a Google executive

build “new clean energy assets in regions and projects of interest,”
according to the blog post, with Google then acting as an offtaker for
the power “as an anchor tenant in the co-located industrial park that
would support data center development.” The Google data center and the
Intersect-built power “would come online alongside its own clean power,
bringing new generation capacity to the grid to meet our load, reduce
time to operation and improve grid reliability.”
</p>
<p>
“This partnership is an evolution of the way hyperscalers and power

id="blinken-faces-critics-in-congress-who-say-afghanistan-withdrawal-lit-the-world-on-fire">Blinken
faces critics in Congress who say Afghanistan withdrawal ‘lit the world
on fire’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared Wednesday
before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to face questions for the
last time about some of the darkest moments of Joe Biden’s presidency:
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The hearing comes at the twilight of Blinken’s diplomatic career,
with only weeks left before President-elect Donald Trump takes office,
and at the end of the chairmanship of Representative Michael McCaul, who
will no longer lead the committee in the next Congress. It’s the
capstone to nearly four years of animosity between the two men over the
end of America’s longest war.</p>
<p>“This catastrophic event was the beginning of a failed foreign policy
that lit the world on fire,” McCaul, a Texas Republican, said in his
opening statement. “I welcome your testimony today and hope you use this
opportunity to take accountability for the disastrous withdrawal.”</p>
<p>Blinken was expected to defend the decision to withdraw U.S. troops
in August 2021. He said previously that the Biden administration was
“severely constrained” by Trump’s decisions and those of previous
presidents.</p>
<p>His long-awaited testimony comes months after House Republicans
issued a scathing report on their investigation into the withdrawal,
blaming the disastrous end on Biden’s administration. They downplayed
Trump’s role in the failures even though he had signed the withdrawal
deal with the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Republican-led review laid out the final months of military and
civilian failures, following Trump’s February 2020 withdrawal deal, that
allowed America’s fundamentalist Taliban enemy to sweep through and
conquer all of the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out
on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens,
Afghan battlefield allies, women activists and others at risk from the
Taliban.</p>
<p>Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic
failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and
concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame.</p>

travels to Mideast as Syria navigates post-Assad path</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken departed
Wednesday for Jordan and later Turkey, seeking to rally regional
countries around a common vision for Syria’s future following the
ousting of longtime authoritarian ruler Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Blinken is scheduled to visit Aqaba, Jordan, and Ankara, Turkey,
where he will meet with leaders from key Arab and Muslim countries to
discuss developments in Syria, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and the broader
region, according to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said Blinken aims to secure consensus among regional
leaders on key principles for Syria’s post-Assad transition. He said
these include full respect for minority rights, the facilitation of
humanitarian aid, the prevention of Syria becoming a haven for terrorism
or a threat to its neighbors and the securing and safe destruction of
chemical or biological weapons stockpiles.</p>
<p>Blinken has said that the United States will recognize a Syrian
government that upholds those principles.</p>
<p>Speaking before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday,
Blinken said he believes President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming
administration will have an interest in preserving the gains made toward
eliminating the “territorial caliphate” that the terror group known as
Islamic State had established in Syria.</p>
<p>Trump and his team have said that the U.S. should not get involved in
Syria.</p>
<p>“This is not our fight. Let it play out,” Trump wrote December 7 on
Truth Social.</p>
<p>During a hearing earlier Wednesday that lasted more than four hours,
Blinken told lawmakers, “If Syria goes the other way — if it fragments —
we’re likely to see more mass migrations. We’re likely to see more
places in Syria that become centers for terrorism and extremism, none of
which is in our interest.”</p>
<p>In Aqaba, Blinken will meet with Jordan’s King Abdulla II and senior
officials to discuss bilateral issues, highlight the U.S.-Jordan
strategic partnership, and reaffirm U.S. support for regional
stability.</p>
<p>In Ankara, Blinken will engage with senior Turkish officials to
strengthen bilateral cooperation on shared priorities, including
counterterrorism and regional stability, with NATO ally Turkey.</p>
<p>Some analysts argue that there is a strategic rationale, at least for
now, in maintaining the current U.S. presence of about 900 U.S. troops
in Syria to contain IS and prevent a resurgence of terrorist groups in
the region.</p>
<p>“But getting involved in a major way is probably contrary to American
interests. And of course, we really haven’t been involved in a major way
in Syria from the beginning of the civil war. You know, over a decade
ago,” said Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat and now a senior fellow
at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Blinken held talks with counterparts from Jordan, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt, where he reiterated the need for
a Syrian-led transition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, will hold an emergency session to address the
situation in Syria. The OPCW — the implementing body for the 1997
Chemical Weapons Convention — said it is monitoring Syria with “special
attention” to chemical weapons sites and has reminded the country of its
duty to declare and destroy all banned weapons.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said it will await the session’s outcome to
determine the next steps.</p>
<p>Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani said on Wednesday that he
would dissolve the security forces of the ousted Assad regime. He also
said his group was working with international organizations to identify
and secure possible sites where chemical weapons may be stored.</p>
<p>The U.S. responded to Golani’s remarks with caution.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters, “We welcome this
type of rhetoric but … actions have to meet words as well.”</p>
<p>Also, U.S. President Joe Biden will join leaders of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations in a virtual summit on Friday to
discuss Syria and other pressing issues in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Syrian rebel groups toppled the Assad regime after a
swift offensive of under two weeks, ending a decades-long reign of
brutal oppression.</p>
<p>While many Syrians celebrate Assad’s departure, uncertainty looms
over the nation’s future. The Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the
dominant faction among opposition forces, is rapidly consolidating
power. At the same time, foreign actors are vying for influence with the
nascent government or seeking to limit its potential as a security
threat.</p>
<p>Gerald Feierstein, director of the Arabian Peninsula Affairs Program
at the Middle East Institute, told VOA, “The Turks are far more
sympathetic to political Islam, and have longstanding ties to Hayat
Tahrir al-Sham and to Golani — not close, but they do have ties. … For
the Gulf states, they’re going to be far more suspicious about which
direction Damascus is going to be going.”</p>
<p>Feierstein noted that while there is currently “not a big gap”
between Turkish and Gulf perspectives, this difference could widen over
time if the new government in Damascus adopts a more hardline Islamist
stance than expected.</p>
<p>Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war claimed 500,000 lives and displaced
half of its 23 million prewar population. Millions of Syrians fled to
neighboring countries such as Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, with
many continuing their journey to Europe in search of safety.</p>

Arctic Report Card</a> concluded that the Arctic tundra is now emitting
more carbon dioxide than it is absorbing thanks to thawing permafrost
and wildfires. This means the tundra is no longer a carbon sink, as it
has been for thousands of years, but a carbon source. “Increasing
surface air temperatures are causing permafrost to warm and thaw,” the
report stated, adding that permafrost temperatures this year were the
highest ever recorded. “Once thawed, permafrost carbon can be decomposed
by microbes and released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases.” At
the same time, increased wildfire activity in the region has contributed

id="biden-approves-national-security-memo-on-china-iran-north-korea-and-russia-ahead-of-trumps-return">Biden
approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia
ahead of Trump’s return</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security
memorandum ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House that could
serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to
counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia,
the White House said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this
summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next
administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the
tightening relationships involving America’s most prominent adversaries
and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. </p>
<p>The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground
rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not
be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. </p>
<p>The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S.
government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of
information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S.
government’s use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum
effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises
involving the adversaries. </p>
<p>The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among
the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries
in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. </p>
<p>The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much
of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From
North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even
thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel
Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported
Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial
base afloat. </p>
<p>In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran
as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. </p>
<p>North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to
help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The
officials added that Russia has “de facto accepted North Korea as a
nuclear weapon state.” </p>
<p>China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two
countries working together to deepen their military technical
cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the
Arctic region. </p>
<p>Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in
both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to
coordinate on national security issues during the transition. </p>
<p>One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo “isn’t
trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one
policy option or another.” </p>
<p>The official said the document is intended to help the next
administration build “capacity” as it shapes its policies on some the
most difficult foreign policies it will face.</p>

40% of Americans say they bet on sports through casinos or apps.
Americans are projected to bet $150 billion on sports this year — that’s
more than the entire annual budget of the state of New York. Today,
we’ll consider what’s behind America’s sports betting boom. But first:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced new data release

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> It’s been clear since Trump pulled out
of the Paris Agreement, to some degree, that China was trying to race
ahead in these clean technologies in a way that America was not. But I
feel like the full arrival of the Chinese EV industry in the U.S.
discourse has only happened in the past year. Can you zoom out and just
give us a sense of how we went from the Chinese car industry being … not
a joke, necessarily, but not really seen as a serious global competitor,
to now, where the Chinese EV industry is shaping U.S. and European
policy at the highest levels?<br/> <br/> <strong>Ilaria Mazzocco:
</strong>I actually think the fact that the traditional internal
combustion engine automotive industry in China was so uncompetitive is
part of the reason why we’re here, right? So the Chinese government for
decades tried to come up with ways of getting a world-class industry. So
it’s like, you know, to access the Chinese market, you have to create a
joint venture, and the government picked — usually it was state-owned
enterprises, which are not known for their dynamism and creativity and
innovation.<br/> <br/> And in fact the car companies that did do better
in China were often sort of the private, or like the small state-owned
enterprises that were sort of coming in from the margins and maybe
struggled to get a license to operate initially — like Geely, right?
Geely was sort of a classic example of that. <br/> <br/> But
essentially, by around the global financial crisis, there was the sense
that this just wasn’t working. And this was also at a time when the
Chinese bureaucracy is starting to think more and more about industrial
upgrading. Salaries in China are going up. So you want to think of
what’s next steps as maybe textiles and other sort of lower-end
manufacturing moves outside of China. And so the thinking was, well, why
don’t we invest and put our weight behind the next-generation technology
in automotive, and sort of invest in that. And that way, we’re competing
on a level playing field. <br/> <br/> Ironically, that’s sort of the
idea — or in the sense that, you know, you’re not competing with
companies that have been accumulating IP for over 100 years, you’re sort
of playing … Chinese companies may have even an advantage if they start
early. <br/> <br/> This was sort of the brainchild of the minister at
the time, the minister of science and technology, who was an auto guy,
Wan Gang. And so this was a fairly small project, to be honest. This
wasn’t something that the secretary of the party or the premier who came
up with it. It was a ministry-level initiative. There were four
ministries working on it, but yeah, pretty small. It was really pilot
city programs, not a big success initially — kind of expensive — but
they stick with it. And that’s kind of the key there, right? So that’s
what the big advantage that the Chinese bureaucracy has, that it can
have that policy continuity. These are not politicized things, issues.
These are, there’s also not, there’s no voters there looking at the
budget and saying, <em><em>You’re spending a ton of money on this
unproven technology.</em></em> And so that’s one advantage.<br/> <br/>
What I also like to point out is that it was the right time. This is,
they started the program to commercialize, right? Obviously there’d been
R&amp;D grants and that sort of thing, but there’s a program to start
actually giving consumers rebates to buy EVs and incentivizing taxi
fleets, which was pretty crucial in China, and bus fleets to electrify
self-starts around 2009, 2010. And you know, in those years, that’s also
when Tesla is starting to emerge, right? This is a moment in which the
technology is … not mature, but it’s mature enough that it can actually
make real strides when it starts to be commercialized. <br/> <br/> And
then the third part is you had really good entrepreneurs. You had BYD
that was just there lobbying to get this. You actually had Tesla in
there trying to get more incentives for this, as well. But, you know,
you had Chinese companies like BYD that were really at the margins and
quite hungry that really took up this opportunity and started investing
and really believed in it. So I think you had that combination of
factors and, you know, now we’re like 15 years later, I think we’re
seeing the results of it. <br/> <br/> I will say it doesn’t always work
that way. To an extent, there’s an element of luck, right? This is the
problem with industrial policy. You can do the work right in the
research and you can get it right, but it’s still not a … you don’t
always know that it’s going to work out. And I give the example of fuel
cell technology. They received the same types of subsidies, fuel cell
passenger vehicles in China. And that, you know, we’re nowhere close to
seeing a mass market for that.

id="atmospheric-river-and-potential-bomb-cyclone-bring-chaotic-winter-weather-to-east-coast">Atmospheric
river and potential bomb cyclone bring chaotic winter weather to East
Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Maine — The U.S. East Coast was beginning a
whiplash-inducing stretch of weather on Wednesday that was rainy, windy
and potentially dangerous, due in part to an atmospheric river and
developing bomb cyclone.</p>
<p>Places like western Maine could see freezing rain, downpours,
unseasonably high temperatures and damaging winds — all in the span of a
day, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather
Service.</p>
<p>The heavy rain and fierce winds will last until Wednesday night in
many areas, and flooding is possible in some locales, forecasters said.
Utilities were also gearing up for potential power outages from damage
caused by winds that could exceed 97 kph in some areas.</p>
<p>One of the key factors driving the weather is an atmospheric river,
which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the
tropics to more northern areas, said Schroeter, who’s based in Gray,
Maine.</p>
<p>The storm has the ability to hit New England hard because it could
tap moisture from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S.
Southeast, and transport it to places like Maine. The state was
preparing for a “multifaceted storm” that could bring two to three
inches of rainfall in some areas, Schroeter said.</p>
<p>Similar conditions had been possible elsewhere from Tuesday night to
Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at the risk of slick travel (Tuesday night) with the
freezing rain,” Schroeter said, “and we are going to be watching for the
potential for flash flooding and sharp rises on streams as temperatures
rise into the 50s (10-15 Celsius).”</p>
<p>Forecasters also said the storm had the potential to include a
process that meteorologists call bombogenesis, or a “bomb cyclone.” That
is the rapid intensification of a cyclone in a short period of time, and
it has the ability to bring severe rainfall.</p>
<p>Parts of the Northeast were already preparing for bad weather. In
Maine, some schools operated on a delay on Tuesday, which began with a
few inches of snow. A flood watch for Vermont runs from Wednesday
afternoon to Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The city of Montpelier, Vermont, was advising residents to prepare
for mild flooding in the area and to elevate items in basements and low
areas that are prone to flooding. The city said Tuesday that it has been
in contact with the National Weather Service and Vermont Dam Safety and
“will be actively monitoring the river levels as this storm passes
through.”</p>
<p>Ski resorts around the Northeast were preparing visitors for a
potentially messy day on Wednesday. Stratton Mountain Resort, in
southern Vermont, posted on its website that patrons “make sure to pack
your Gore-Tex gear because it’s going to be a wet one.”</p>

largest humanitarian crisis ever recorded: IRC report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAIRO — Sudan has become the “biggest humanitarian crisis ever
recorded” after 20 months of devastating war between rival generals, the
International Rescue Committee said in a report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The country accounts for 10% of all people in humanitarian need,
despite being home to less than 1% of global population,” the New
York-based organization said in their 2025 Emergency Watchlist.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, a war between the Sudanese regular army and the
paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people
and uprooted 12 million.</p>
<p>Nearly 9 million of those are displaced within Sudan, most in areas
with decimated infrastructure and facing the threat of mass
starvation.</p>
<p>Across the country, nearly 26 million people – around half the
population – are facing acute hunger, according to the United
Nations.</p>
<p>Famine has already been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in
the western Darfur region, and the United Nations has said Sudan is
facing the worst humanitarian crisis in recent memory.</p>
<p>IRC’s report highlights the 20 countries at greatest risk of
humanitarian deterioration, with Sudan ranking highest on the list for
the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>They said a total of 30.4 million people were in humanitarian need
across the northeast African country, making it “the largest
humanitarian crisis since records began,” the IRC said.</p>
<p>There is no end to the war in sight, with both parties intensifying
strikes on residential areas in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The IRC warned of total “humanitarian collapse,” as the health crisis
was set to worsen and both sides continued to “choke humanitarian
access.”</p>
<p>Around 305 million people worldwide are in need of humanitarian
support, according to IRC, with 82% of them in watchlist areas such as
the occupied Palestinian territories, Myanmar, Syria, South Sudan and
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“It is clear that ‘the world is on fire’ is a daily reality for
hundreds of millions of people,” IRC chief David Miliband said.</p>
<p>“The world is being cleaved into two camps: between those born in
unstable conflict states, and those with a chance to make it in stable
states.”</p>

House wants Syrian-led process for new government after Assad’s
ouster</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration says it is in touch with all
rebel groups in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad
and wants the process of forming a new government to be led by
Syrians.</p>
<p>White House national security communications adviser John Kirby spoke
with VOA Turkish’s White House correspondent Begum Donmez Ersoz and said
whatever governance comes out of the process, Washington wants to make
sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>Kirby says it’s too soon to tell whether Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS),
the Sunni Islamic al-Qaida offshoot that the United States has
designated a terror group, and its leader, Mohammed al-Golani, have
undergone an ideological transformation.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: Did Israel give the United States prior notification of their
strikes on the Golan Heights and their deeper push into Syria?</p>
<p>John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser: I’m
going to let the Israelis speak to their operations, and I’m not going
to speculate about what they’re doing. I would just tell you that they
certainly have the right to self-defense. We recognize that they see
threats across that border as things unfold in Syria, and they’ve taken
some actions. … We, too, share a concern that the Israelis have over
chemical weapons and the possibility of stockpiles in Syria and the
potential use … so we’re in constant communication with the Israelis
about what they’re doing, and that will continue.</p>
<p>VOA: Does the U.S. believe that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has undergone an
ideological transformation?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think it’s too soon to tell. Mr. al-Golani is saying the
right things about inclusiveness, about not being interested in
persecuting either minorities or other groups. But I think, you know, we
have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of trying to
establish good governance. … They are still a designated terrorist
group. … Whatever kind of governance comes out of this, we want to make
sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, that they have a
vote and a voice in their future. So, we want it to be a Syrian-led
process, and the United States will continue to support that kind of
process.</p>
<p>VOA: There is a concern in Turkey about the potential of an
independent Kurdish state in northern Syria. How will the United States
mitigate Turkey’s concerns?</p>
<p>Kirby: They have legitimate concerns in terms of the safety and
security of people inside Turkey. I know right now, Syria is kind of
coming to the fore because of the news over the weekend, but it’s not as
if we haven’t continually, over the last four years, had conversations
with the Turks about their concerns along that border. And quite
frankly, sharing with them our concerns about what we’re trying to do
against ISIS, partnering with the Syrian Democratic Forces. So, where
those two levels of concerns overlap, or maybe conflict, we have the
ability and have executed the ability to have conversations with the
Turks to try to sort all this out.</p>
<p>VOA: The United States is talking to Turkey for information on the
whereabouts of journalist Austin Tice. Can you share more on those
talks?</p>
<p>Kirby: I won’t get into the details of the discussions. … We’re still
trying to get more context and information about Austin — where he is,
what condition he might be in. We obviously talked to the Turks about
this … but we also talked to other counterparts in the region. Those
conversations are ongoing. As the president said on Sunday, we want to
see him back home with his family where he belongs, and we’ll continue
to have the level of engagement in the region to see if we can bring
about that outcome.</p>
<p>VOA: President-elect Donald Trump has signaled a hands-off approach
in Syria. What would be the danger of that for U.S. interests in the
region?</p>
<p>Kirby: Well, we’ll let Mr. Trump speak to his plans when he comes
into office. We believe there are two things keenly in America’s
national security interest. Number 1 is the transition, peaceful
transition, to legitimate governance in Syria that is a Syrian-led
process. … The second thing that’s very much in our national security
interest is making sure that ISIS cannot regenerate the capabilities
like it had in 2014 and cannot exploit the current uncertainty in Syria
to their own advantage.</p>
<p>VOA: Syria was an important playground for Iran and the Shia
Crescent. That has been broken now. Do you think Iran’s ambitions over
the Middle East are over?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think only [the] supreme leader can answer that particular
question. … As Iran wakes up and looks at the region, it is different,
and their axis of resistance has been broken in many, many places. … And
they, too, have been weakened as a military and as a capability, just in
terms of, for instance, air defense. … That said, I can’t tell you that,
as we look at the world today, that we see Iran giving up on their
hegemonic ambitions in the region. They certainly are not as capable of
executing those visions and that ambition, but I haven’t seen anything
that would indicate that that they’re turning a blind eye to trying to
pursue those kinds of ambitions.</p>
<p>VOA: Would the United States accept a hard-line government under HTS
in Syria that would contain Iran, as Golani alluded to in his
speech?</p>
<p>Kirby: What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is
governance that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable,
that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, and that is the result,
the product, of a Syrian-led process to get them to that point. I think
it’s too soon to know exactly how it’s all going to unfold, and we’re
watching this real, real close.</p>

<h2 id="bill-to-protect-journalists-fails-in-us-senate">Bill to protect
journalists fails in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A shield law known as the PRESS Act that would give
journalists greater federal protections failed to pass the Senate on
Tuesday evening after it was blocked by Senator Tom Cotton.  </p>
<p>Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government
to disclose information such as the identities of sources. The PRESS Act
would also limit the seizure of journalists’ data without their
knowledge.  </p>
<p>Nearly every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a
shield law or court recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but
no federal law is in place.  </p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives unanimously passed
the PRESS Act in January.  </p>
<p>But an attempt to pass the bill in the Senate via unanimous consent
failed Tuesday evening after being blocked by Cotton. Any single senator
has the power to halt a bill put forward by a unanimous consent
request. </p>
<p>In a speech, Cotton, a Republican, said he was blocking the bill over
national security concerns.  </p>
<p>“Passage of this bill would turn the United States Senate into the
active accomplice of deep-state leakers, traitors and criminals, along
with the America-hating and fame-hungry journalists who help them out,”
Cotton said. </p>
<p>“Contrary to what members of the press may think, a press badge
doesn’t make you better than the rest of America,” Cotton later added.
 </p>
<p>The PRESS Act makes exceptions for terrorism and other
emergencies. </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Ron Wyden made a rebuttal after Cotton’s speech.
 </p>
<p>“I understand that we don’t have unanimous consent today. I think
it’s unfortunate. I think America would be stronger and freer if we were
passing this legislation today. But we’ll be back,” Wyden said.  </p>
<p>“This is about as important as it gets. Free speech is fundamental to
what makes our country so special,” Wyden said later. </p>
<p>Press freedom groups expressed disappointment over the bill’s failure
to pass. </p>
<p>“This is a commonsense bill with broad bipartisan support,” Gabe
Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, told VOA. “It’s time to get it across the finish line.”  </p>
<p>After President-elect Donald Trump won election to the White House in
November, several press freedom groups said they were making a final
push to get the bill through Congress and signed into law before
President Joe Biden left office.  </p>
<p>Trump has previously threatened to jail journalists if they don’t
reveal sources in stories he believes have national security
implications.  </p>
<p>And last month, he called on Republicans to “kill this bill” in a
post on Truth Social. </p>
<p>Now, the only way that the PRESS Act could pass the Senate is either
by attaching it to a year-end spending bill or bringing it up for a
stand-alone vote, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, or
FPF.  </p>
<p>“We need more than speeches about the PRESS Act’s importance. We need
action. Senate Democrats had all year to move this bipartisan bill, and
now time is running out,” FPF’s advocacy director Seth Stern said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>“Hopefully, today was a preview of more meaningful action to come,”
Stern said.</p>
<p>The PRESS Act’s failure comes on the same day that a Justice
Department report revealed that federal prosecutors ignored Justice
Department rules when they seized journalists’ phone records as part of
a media leak investigation during the Trump administration.</p>

signals hands-off Syria approach. Can he deliver?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump has signaled he wants to avoid involvement in Syria
following an insurgent group’s ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.
However, as White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports, the
president-elect might need to balance his stance with U.S. goals of
protecting Israel, isolating Iran, and dealing with Russia, Turkey and
other actors.</p>

<h2 id="how-us-foreign-policy-is-made">How US foreign policy is
made</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When most people think of U.S. foreign policy, they
picture the president. The president, to be sure, is the nation’s chief
executive and its chief foreign policy architect. But he is not the only
one calling the shots, and his power has limits.</p>
<p>Consider what U.S. presidents can and cannot do. They can deploy the
U.S. military around the world but cannot declare war — that power rests
with Congress. They can enter into executive agreements with other
countries but not treaties, which require Senate approval. They can
establish ties with a foreign government but cannot send a dime’s worth
of aid without Congressional appropriation.</p>
<p>Presidents often find their powers tested after they enter office.
During his first term in office, then-President Donald Trump pulled out
of the Paris agreement on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran,
but his campaign pledge to rein in North Korea’s nuclear weapons program
and end “endless wars” in the Middle East remained unfulfilled.
President Joe Biden’s administration then rejoined the Paris agreement
and pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, but he failed to revive the
Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>“There are limits to what a president can do and that is because of
the number of actors that are involved and the number of checks and
balances that do exist,” said David McKean, former director of policy
planning for the State Department and staff director for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who served as ambassador to Luxemburg.</p>
<p>Historically, foreign policy was the president’s domain, with
significant Congressional input, according to Thomas Schwartz, a
historian of U.S. foreign policy at Vanderbilt University. In the 18th
and 19th centuries, the State Department was small, and the executive
bureaucracy limited.</p>
<p>As the U.S. grew in power in the 20th century, so did its foreign
policymaking apparatus.</p>
<p>“Today’s foreign policy machinery is enormous, committed to billions
of dollars and thousands of persons involved, in the military,
political, economic arms of the United States,” Schwartz told VOA. “The
one thing that probably is consistent is that the role of the president
… is now much more in the forefront.”</p>
<p>A model of the U.S. foreign policymaking process, developed by the
late political scientist Roger Hilsman, includes three circles:</p>
<pre><code>The inner circle:  The president and his close advisers, including his national security adviser who usually heads National Security Council meetings
The middle circle: Key executive branch departments and agencies – the departments of State and Defense, the military&#39;s high command, the intelligence community
The outer circle: Congress and a variety of other actors, including interest groups, corporations, think tanks, foreign governments – all vying for influence</code></pre>
<p>“There is no doubt that the institutional architecture of foreign
policy has gotten much, much bigger,” McKean said.</p>
<p>For example, the State Department, a small agency with 700 employees
in the 1930s, has expanded to a 70,000-strong bureaucracy, McKean
noted.</p>
<p>The NSC</p>
<p>The NSC is the nerve center of the foreign policymaking machinery.
Created in 1947, the office, located next door to the White House, has
expanded in size and scope. Its principal members include the president,
the vice president, the secretaries of state and defense and other top
officials. McKean calls this the “president’s own foreign policy
team.”</p>
<p>The national security adviser’s influence has changed from
administration to administration. However, the adviser, McKean said, has
the ear of the president while the secretary of State is often
traveling.”</p>
<p>When a crisis erupts, such as the fall of the Assad regime in Syria,
the NSC swings into action. To help the president decide on a course of
action, the national security adviser calls an emergency “principals
meeting,” while NSC staff put together options for discussion.</p>
<p>“When you’re dealing with an immediate crisis like Assad, you’ve got
no time, you’ve got negative time,” said Gordon Adams, an emeritus
professor of international relations at American University who served
on the NSC in the 1990s. “Cars have to pick up principles and whisk them
to the White House, and those meetings start at any hour of the day or
night and happen with great urgency.”</p>
<p>Congress</p>
<p>With the president in charge of foreign policy, a change in
administration can result in significant policy shifts. But often there
is more continuity than change.  </p>
<p>That is because the president is not the only actor shaping foreign
policy.  As a co-equal branch of government, Congress plays an important
role. Though not given a specific role in foreign affairs, Congress can
provide oversight of policy decisions and pass legislation to shape
policy. </p>
<p>Most importantly, Congress controls the budget, Adams said. This
means it can influence how much money is spent on foreign aid, military
operations and other international initiatives. For example,
President-elect Trump has promised a mass deportation of undocumented
migrants, but he’ll need congressional funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>“Congress is going to have a voice in what the legislative term
language is around that process and around the money that is actually
appropriated for that process,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Other actors</p>
<p>As the foreign policy machinery has grown over the years, so too has
the influence of outside actors. These include corporations, interest
groups, think tanks, foreign governments, the media and the public.</p>
<p>“That is also an area where I think there’s been a huge increase in
influence so that corporations increasingly play a big role in foreign
policy because so much of what goes on in terms of trade involves
multinational corporations,” McKean said.</p>
<p>Foreign allies can also influence U.S. foreign policy, though this
varies from issue to issue and administration to administration, Adams
said. He noted that in the 1990s, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair
persuaded a reluctant President Bill Clinton to intervene in the
Balkans.</p>
<p>With so many actors involved in the U.S. foreign policymaking
process, the system can seem bewildering to policymakers in other
Western democracies, Adams said.</p>
<p>“They don’t have this kind of sloppy all-over-the-place set of
display of interests and the ambitions and agendas that we have in the
American policy process,” Adams said. “So in a way, we have one of the
least efficient policy processes of Western democracies.”</p>

id="trump-says-hell-name-andrew-ferguson-head-of-ftc-kimberly-guilfoyle-as-ambassador-to-greece">Trump
says he’ll name Andrew Ferguson head of FTC, Kimberly Guilfoyle as
ambassador to Greece</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump made another flurry of job
announcements on Tuesday, selecting Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of
the Federal Trade Commission, Ron Johnson was nominated to be ambassador
to Mexico, and Kimberly Guilfoyle to be ambassador to Greece.</p>
<p>Ferguson, who is already one of the FTC’s five commissioners, will
replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and
Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars’ worth of corporate
acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive
behavior.</p>
<p>“Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship,
and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump wrote on
Truth Social, adding, “Andrew will be the most America First, and
pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.”</p>
<p>Tom Barrack was chosen as the nominee for ambassador to Turkey.
Barrack, a wealthy financier, met Trump in the 1980s while helping
negotiate Trump’s purchase of the renowned Plaza Hotel. He was charged
with using his personal access to the former president to secretly
promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates but was acquitted of
all counts at a federal trial in 2022.</p>
<p>Trump called him a “well-respected and experienced voice of
reason.”</p>
<p>Johnson — not the Republican senator — served as ambassador to El
Salvador during Trump’s first administration. His nomination comes as
the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and
the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico
border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the
Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news
personality who led the fundraising for Trump’s 2020 campaign and became
engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her “a close friend and ally”
and praised her “sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.”
Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.</p>
<p>“I am so proud of Kimberly. She loves America and she always has
wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador. She will be an amazing
leader for America First,” Don Jr. posted.</p>
<p>The ambassador positions must be approved by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle said in a social media post that she was “honored to accept
President Trump’s nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece
and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate.”</p>
<p>Trump also announced Tuesday that he had selected Jacob Helberg as
the next undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the
environment, and Dan Bishop as deputy director for budget at the Office
of Budget and Management.</p>
<p>The replacement of Khan at the FTC likely means that the commission
will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust
enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the
FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions.</p>
<p>“These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business
than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be
determined,” wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at
Holland &amp; Knight, in a recent analysis.</p>
<p>Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new
life with Trump in command.</p>
<p>For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed
merger between the country’s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and
Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two
judges halted the merger Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to
block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading
to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a
merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals
like Walmart.</p>
<p>One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in
the administrative hearing.</p>
<p>Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the
Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC’s efforts to block
the deal, some experts have said.</p>
<p>And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any
anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms
such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in
Trump’s orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have
previously expressed support for Khan’s scrutiny of Big Tech firms.</p>

id="us-moves-to-save-once-common-monarch-butterflies-from-extinction">US
moves to save once-common monarch butterflies from extinction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is moving to grant federal protections
to the monarch butterfly — a once-common species recognizable by its
striking black and orange patterns that has faced a dramatic population
decline in recent decades.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said Tuesday it has initiated a
public comment period to consider listing the insect under the
Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>But the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who rolled back numerous
wildlife protections during his first term, casts uncertainty over the
decision.</p>
<p>“The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America,
captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle,”
said FWS Director Martha Williams in a statement. “Despite its
fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when
we just give them a chance.”</p>
<p>The proposed listing comes at a critical time for the species, which
has been designated as endangered by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature since 2022.</p>
<p>Monarchs are divided into two migratory populations in North America.
The larger eastern group has declined by approximately 80% since the
1980s, while the western population has plummeted by 95%.</p>
<p>According to the FWS, the species faces a host of threats, including
the loss and degradation of its breeding, migratory and overwintering
habitats; exposure to insecticides; and the growing impacts of climate
change.</p>
<p>As part of its conservation efforts, the FWS is also recommending the
designation of critical habitat at specific overwintering sites along
California’s coast. These habitats serve as vital winter refuges,
providing monarchs the resources needed to rest and prepare for spring
breeding.</p>
<p>“The fact that a butterfly as widespread and beloved as the monarch
is now the face of the extinction crisis is a tri-national distress
signal warning us to take better care of the environment that we all
share,” said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for
Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>“For 30 years, we’ve watched the population of monarch butterflies
collapse. It is clear that monarchs cannot thrive — and might not
survive — without federal protections,” added Dan Ritzman, director of
conservation at Sierra Club.</p>
<p>The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is widely credited with saving
iconic American species such as the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly
bear.</p>
<p>During Trump’s first administration, however, key provisions of the
law were weakened. These changes, later reversed by President Joe Biden,
included measures that allowed industrial projects such as roads,
pipelines and mines in areas designated as critical habitat for
vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration also removed endangered species protections
for gray wolves across most of the United States and slashed critical
habitat designated for northern spotted owls.</p>

says review of Nippon-US Steel tie-up ongoing as US Steel shares
tumble</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A national security review of Nippon Steel’s $15 billion bid for U.S.
Steel is ongoing and President Joe Biden will see what it yields before
making a decision on whether to block it, the White House said on
Tuesday, cautioning he still opposes the tie-up.</p>
<p>The statement comes after shares of U.S. Steel tumbled more than 10%
on Tuesday afternoon following a Bloomberg report suggesting the deal
would be killed in short order.</p>
<p>CFIUS, a powerful committee charged with reviewing foreign
investments in U.S. firms for national security risks, has until
December 22 to make a decision on whether to approve, block or extend
the timeline for the deal’s review, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>“The President’s position since the beginning is that it is vital for
U.S. Steel to be domestically owned and operated,” Saloni Sharma, a
White House spokesperson said in a statement. “As we have said before,
the President will continue to see what the CFIUS process yields. We
have not received any CFIUS recommendation. The CFIUS process was and
remains ongoing.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s initial headline read that Biden was “set to” block the
deal, suggesting a final decision had been made, but the outlet later
updated it to say he “plans to” kill it, echoing prior comments and
leaving the door open to a last-minute change.</p>
<p>CFIUS declined to comment.</p>
<p>Japan’s Nippon Steel said it was inappropriate that politics
continued to outweigh true national security interests.</p>
<p>“Nippon Steel still has confidence in the justice and fairness of
America and its legal system, and — if necessary — will work with U.S.
Steel to consider and take all available measures to reach a fair
conclusion,” it added in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel said the transaction should be approved on its merits.</p>
<p>“The benefits are overwhelmingly clear,” it said in a statement. “Our
communities, customers, investors, and employees strongly support this
transaction, and we will continue to advocate for them and adherence to
the rule of law.”</p>
<p>The two companies are poised to pursue litigation over the process if
Biden decides to block the merger.</p>
<p>The acquisition has faced opposition within the U.S. since it was
announced last year with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald
Trump both publicly indicating their intention to block it.</p>
<p>CFIUS told the two companies in September the deal would create
national security risks because it could hurt the supply of steel needed
for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.</p>
<p>Despite opposition, including from the United Steelworkers union,
Japan’s Nippon has pressed on in pursuit of a deal, promising to not
transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. if
the merger succeeds.</p>
<p>Nippon has also said it would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel’s
decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures
under U.S. law against unfair trade practices.</p>
<p>In a bid to win over support from workers, Nippon Steel said on
Tuesday it planned to give employees $5,000 each if the deal with U.S.
Steel closed. It also pledged $3,160 closing bonuses to employees in
Europe, which would result in a nearly $100 million total payment to
employees.</p>

id="report-on-attempts-to-kill-trump-urges-secret-service-to-limit-protection-of-foreign-leaders">Report
on attempts to kill Trump urges Secret Service to limit protection of
foreign leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A congressional task force investigating the attempts to
kill Donald Trump during his presidential campaign is recommending
changes to the Secret Service, including protecting fewer foreign
leaders during the height of election season and considering moving the
agency out of the Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>The 180-page report by the bipartisan task force released Tuesday is
one of the most detailed looks so far into the July assassination
attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and a
second attempt in Florida two months later.</p>
<p>Like the series of other investigations and reports, the task force
railed at the agency tasked with protecting the top echelon of America’s
democratic leaders.</p>
<p>“The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the
litany of related security failures are unacceptable,” the authors
wrote. “The Secret Service’s zero fail mission allows no margin for
error, let alone for the many errors described in this report.”</p>
<p>In the July shooting, a gunman opened fire from the roof of a nearby
building, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and wounding
two others. He was killed by a counter sniper.</p>
<p>In another assassination attempt in September, a gunman waited for
hours for Trump to appear at his golf course in Florida, but a Secret
Service agent thwarted the attack by spotting the firearm poking through
some bushes.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of the new report and its
recommendations:</p>
<p>Reducing the number of people protected — specifically foreign
leaders</p>
<p>The report’s authors noted that the number of people the agency is
tasked with protecting has “greatly expanded.” At the same time, the
presidential campaign season is getting longer and more intense.</p>
<p>The agency is also tasked with protecting foreign dignitaries during
the U.N. General Assembly, when heads of state and government flood into
New York. That event happens every September, which comes at the “height
of campaign season,” the report noted, adding to the agency’s staffing
crunch.</p>
<p>“Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective
role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties
can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS’s primary
duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders,” the
report said.</p>
<p>Drop some investigative work, especially during elections</p>
<p>The Secret Service is known for its high-profile work of protecting
the president, the vice president, presidential candidates, their
families and others.</p>
<p>But agents also carry out a wide range of investigations not related
to their protective mission — investigating fraud and financial crimes,
for example. Stemming from when the agency was part of the Treasury
Department, those investigations are an important part of training
Secret Service officers for skills they’ll need on protective details,
agency leaders say.</p>
<p>But the task force recommended reviewing these investigative
responsibilities — especially during campaign season — so the agency
“can prioritize the protection of U.S. leaders and candidates running
for office.”</p>
<p>Questioning whether the Secret Service should stay in the Homeland
Security Department</p>
<p>After DHS was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks, the Secret Service was moved there from the Treasury
Department.</p>
<p>The task force suggested reevaluating that move. During the time
Secret Service has been in the Homeland Security Department, “USSS has
not benefited from stable leadership,” the lawmakers said.</p>
<p>They said the structure “potentially weakens USSS, a small but
critically important agency, in advocating for its budget and other
priorities inside a much larger entity.”</p>
<p>Staffing problems</p>
<p>The task force said the gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, Thomas
Crooks, exploited gaps in protection because of a lack of assets and
staff.</p>
<p>Specifically, the panel noted that the Secret Service, already
dealing with the increased tempo of a presidential campaign, was
protecting not one but two high-profile people that day in close
vicinity to each other, with first lady Jill Biden at a nearby
event.</p>
<p>In one example highlighting the lack of resources at the Trump rally,
the task force said there should have been a counter-surveillance unit
in Butler, and if there had been one assigned that day, it might have
spotted the shooter earlier.</p>
<p>Such a counter-surveillance team was in place for the Biden event,
the report noted, although that event was indoors.</p>
<p>“From interviews with special agents on the ground, it appears that
the main factor in the decision to not request [the counter-surveillance
unit] was an assumption that the request would be denied due to the
protectee’s status as a former President at the time of the event,” the
report said.</p>
<p>Pointing to bad communication, faulty planning</p>
<p>Much of the criticism in the aftermath of the July assassination
attempt has centered on how the shooter could have gotten access to a
roof with a clear line of sight to Trump and why there was such poor
communication between the Secret Service and local law enforcement.</p>
<p>The Secret Service often relies on local law enforcement to secure
large events. The report detailed how local law enforcement had one idea
of its responsibilities while the Secret Service had another.</p>
<p>But the task force emphasized that ultimately the Secret Service is
responsible for ensuring that coordination runs smoothly.</p>
<p>“The Secret Service must own responsibility for the security of the
site,” the report said.</p>

id="suspect-in-killing-of-ceo-struggles-shouts-while-entering-courthouse">Suspect
in killing of CEO struggles, shouts while entering courthouse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The suspect in the killing of
UnitedHealthcare’s CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while
arriving for a court appearance Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a day after he
was arrested at a McDonald’s and charged with murder.</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione emerged from a patrol car, spun toward
reporters and shouted something partly unintelligible referring to an
“insult to the intelligence of the American people” while deputies
pushed him inside.</p>
<p>Prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione back to
New York while new details emerged about his life and how he was
captured. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland
real estate family was charged with murder hours after he was arrested
in the Manhattan killing of Brian Thompson, who led the largest U.S.
medical insurance company.</p>
<p>At the brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey informed the court
that Mangione will not waive extradition to New York but instead wants a
hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he
was too dangerous to be released.</p>
<p>Mangione, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, mostly stared straight
ahead at the hearing, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his
chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to
respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.</p>
<p>A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that
at the time of his arrest, Mangione was carrying a handwritten document
expressing anger with what he called “parasitic” health insurance
companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power.</p>
<p>He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in
the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while
“our life expectancy” does not, according to the bulletin.</p>
<p>In social media posts, Mangione called “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski a
“political revolutionary,” according to the police bulletin. Kaczynski
carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society
and technology.</p>
<p>Mangione remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially
charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing
false identification to police. Manhattan prosecutors have obtained an
arrest warrant, a step that could help expedite his extradition from
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>McDonald’s customer recognizes suspect</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania — about 370 kilometers
(about 230 miles) west of New York City — after a McDonald’s customer
recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.</p>
<p>Officers found him sitting at a back table, wearing a blue medical
mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police
criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione
whether he’d been to New York recently, he “became quiet and started to
shake,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>When he pulled his mask down at the officers’ request, “we knew that
was our guy,” Officer Tyler Frye said.</p>
<p>Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police
showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald’s while
holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and
beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with
rumpled hair.</p>
<p>New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Mangione was carrying
a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the
suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a
passport and other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said
Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows “some
ill will toward corporate America.”</p>
<p>A law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed
to have acted alone.</p>
<p>“To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do
for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly
that I wasn’t working with anyone,” the document said, according to the
official.</p>
<p>It also had a line that said, “I do apologize for any strife or
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it
coming.”</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a
Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to
consider the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to
wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.</p>
<p>Investigators have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on
ammunition found near Thompson’s body. The words mimic “delay, deny,
defend,” a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the
shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus.</p>
<p>Suspect’s family prays for victim’s family</p>
<p>A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and
philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state
legislator.</p>
<p>Valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, he went on to earn
undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the
University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s
family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his
cousin, Maryland Delegate Nino Mangione. “We offer our prayers to the
family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all
involved.”</p>
<p>From January to June 2022, Luigi Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a
“co-living” space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote
workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a
spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.</p>
<p>“Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no
complaints,” Ryan said. “There was no sign that might point to these
alleged crimes they’re saying he committed.”</p>
<p>At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from
childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to
romance, Ryan said.</p>
<p>Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said,
then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.</p>
<p>Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.</p>

Are Expecting a Natural Gas Boom. Will They Get It?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI0MjQ3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzkyNzI3MH0.-bSZ0NnJx3LgxPt-u5QOUSlILjV7kiaKOD7V7lXw1n4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When you think of companies whose valuations are soaring due to
artificial intelligence, the ones that come to mind first are probably
the chip designer Nvidia, whose shares are up 180% this year, or Elon
Musk’s xAI, which its investors recently valued at
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-startup-xai-valued-at-50-billion-in-new-funding-round-7e3669dc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But aside from those, some of the best performing companies of this year
have been those that own or supply equipment for the power plants that
generate the energy to run all that AI infrastructure in the first
place.
</p>
<p>
GE Vernova’s gas turbine orders have almost doubled so far this year,
chief executive Scott Strazik
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_webcast_transcript_10232024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in an October earnings call</u></a>; since then, the company has secured
orders for another nearly 9 gigawatts’ worth of turbines in the U.S.,
the company said in an
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_investor_update_presentation_12102024.pdf" target="_blank">investor
presentation</a> Tuesday. “I can’t think of a time that the gas business
has had more fun than they’re having right now,” Strazik told investors.
The company’s stock is up almost 150% from the end of 2023.
</p>
<p>
Vistra, which owns over 40,000 megawatts of generation assets, including
around 6,500 megawatts of nuclear power plants and more than two dozen
gas-fired power plants, is planning on developing 2,000 megawatts of
natural gas capacity, its chief executive Jim Burke
<a href="https://investor.vistracorp.com/2024-11-07-Vistra-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Results,-Raises-and-Narrows-2024-Guidance,-and-Initiates-2025-Guidance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in November</u>; its share price</a> is up 272% for the year. The
utility Entergy, which last week
<a href="https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/meta-selects-northeast-louisiana-as-site-10-billion-data-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a deal with Meta</u></a> to power a planned data center in northeastern
Louisiana, is up 45%. Compare those impressive results to the S&amp;P
500, which is up a healthy but comparatively modest 27% on the year.
</p>
<p>
Much of that enthusiasm comes from huge expected increases in energy
demand. Grid Strategies, an energy policy consulting firm, last week
updated its forecast for energy demand growth over the next five years,
raising it from an increase of 39 gigawatts as of the end of 2023 to a
rise of <em><em>128 gigawatts</em></em>. That works out to annual
projected growth of around 3%, compared to less than 1% annual growth in
the first two decades of this century.
</p>
<p>
Where will all that additional energy come from? “Quite frankly, in the
next five years, we’re going to see a lot of new gas turbines being
built,” Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told me, adding that the “prospects are good for
a natural gas boom.”
</p>
<p>
The data centers that are driving renewable demand tend to require a
constant flow of energy at all times — except when their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power
demands surge</u></a> — while renewables are intermittent and may be far
away from planned load growth. While so-called hyperscalers such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-x-energy-nuclear-deal" target="_self"><u>Amazon</u></a>,
<a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Meta</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Google</u></a>
have made deals to support the development of 24/7 clean power sources
like nuclear, the most optimistic time frame for any of these new
developments to start producing power is sometime in the early 2030s.
</p>
<p>
Rob Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies, told me the technology
companies generating all this demand growth typically want it satisfied
with renewables, but “they really need transmission in order to do
that.”
</p>
<p>
“If everyone had done this 10 years ago, we could have connected a lot
of generation a lot quicker. It could have been a lot cleaner generation
mix,” Gramlich told me. Now, though, even if a utility wants to build
solar, wind, and storage that can provide power at costs comparable to
new gas, “it’s only available as an option if you build the grid
infrastructure ahead of time,” he said.
</p>
<p>
McGeady agrees. “It’s the only path forward,” he said of natural gas.
“Nobody is willing to <em><em>not</em></em> build the next data center
because of inability to access renewables.”
</p>
<p>
But therein lies the difficulty: While natural gas plants are not as
transmission-dependent as renewables, some analysts worry that even gas
generators won’t be able to respond quickly enough to the increase in
demand.
</p>
<p>
“When we look at the hot spots of Data Center development, in the U.S.
and around the world, we see a significant overlap with regions that
have favorable policy support for natural gas,” Morgan Stanley analysts
wrote in a note to clients. And yet, “there will in our view be a
significant shortfall in available U.S. power grid access relative to
the magnitude of new data centers needed to ‘absorb’ the AI equipment
purchases over the next several years, with the bottleneck becoming
apparent in mid-to-late 2025,” the analysts wrote.
</p>
<p>
The utilities in these areas — places like
<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/12/02/georgia-power-says-data-center-growth-will-cause-electricity-demands-to-triple-in-next-decade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Georgia</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.aps.com/en/About/Our-Company/Newsroom/Articles/APS_Secures_its_Largest-Ever_Energy_Supply_to_Reliably_Serve_Customers#:~:text=Arizona%20Public%20Service%20(APS)%20has,state's%20growing%20demand%20for%20energy." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arizona</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/regulators-ok-duke-energys-gas-plant-buildout-despite-n-c-climate-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>North
Carolina</u></a> — are indeed building new natural gas capacity. In
other places where the laws and regulations aren’t as favorable to gas
development, however, analysts expect to see more data centers sited at
existing power plants. Some of those may be powered by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>fossil
fuels</u></a>, as in the case of a New Jersey facility recently taken
over by the cloud computing company Core Weave, while others may wind up
taking zero-carbon power off the grid, as Amazon
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-11-4-2024/card/the-amazon-talen-deal-why-it-was-stopped-0zPgZJrJatPX0GZ2Wr38" target="_blank"><u>attempted
to do</u></a> with the Susquehanna nuclear station in Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
Building new natural gas capacity is more difficult in the PJM
Interconnection, the country’s largest electricity market, which spans
the Eastern Seaboard and a large chunk of the Midwest. Its leadership is
hoping high prices can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>lure
new gas</u> generation</a>, but the complexity and uncertainty of the
system’s reward structure for companies that agree to supply failsafe
capacity has hindered the massive new investment PJM says it needs.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Some clean energy advocates argue that utilities are being short-sighted
in their plans to develop new gas resources that could be around for
decades — well past corporate, state, or national goals for electric
system decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
“They’re used to building gas plants more so than they’re used to
building other things. It reflects a lack of creativity on their part,”
Michelle Solomon, a senior policy analyst at Energy Innovation, told me.
</p>
<p>
But until
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>the
system for building and paying</u></a> for transmission can be reformed
to clarify who pays for what and what transmission can be built where —
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/experts-react-senators-manchin-and-barrasso-announce-permitting-reform-bill" target="_blank"><u>as
federal regulators and Congress are trying to do</u></a> — utilities
will likely default to what they know best.
</p>
<p>
“The difficulty of building transmission certainly can constrain
utilities’ ability to serve new load, and it can constrain the ability
to serve the load with clean generation,” Gramlich told me.
</p>
<p>
Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice president of energy transition and
power and renewables,
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/gridlock-demand-dilemma-facing-us-power-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>echoed</u></a>
Gramlich’s thought in a note from October. “The constraint is not the
demand for renewables,” he wrote, “but the ability to get through
permitting, interconnection, and building out the transmission system
accordingly.”

President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday rocked the energy world when he
promised “fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no
way limited to, all Environmental approvals” for “Any person or company
investing ONE BILLION DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of
America,”

</p>
<p>
“GET READY TO ROCK!!!” he added.
</p>
<p>
Trump has frequently derided regulatory barriers to development,
including in his announcements of various economic and policy roles in
his upcoming administration. His designee for Secretary of the Interior,
Doug Burgum, for instance, will also head a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self">
<u>National Energy Council</u></a> that will “oversee the path to U.S.
ENERGY DOMINANCE by cutting red tape … by focusing on INNOVATION over
longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation.”<br/> <br/> When
Trump
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113466208496990420" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>announced his nomination</u></a> of Lee Zeldin to head the
Environmental Protection Agency, he said Zeldin would “ensure fair and
swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash
the power of American business.”
</p>
<p>
Current interpretations of existing laws dictate that any project
constituting a major federal action (e.g. one that uses public lands)
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12560#:~:text=In%20the%20words%20of%20the,than%20unwise%E2%80%94agency%20action.%E2%80%9D&text=major%20federal%20actions%20must%20occur,of%20control%20over%20the%20outcome." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>must be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act</u></a>,
the country’s signature permitting law. Federal courts are often asked
in litigation to sign off on whether that review process — although not
the outcome — was sufficient.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of any changes Trump may make to the federal regulatory
system as president, that infrastructure is already in flux. The D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals recently issued a ruling that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/nepa-ruling" target="_self">
<u>throws into doubt decades of NEPA enforcement</u></a>. Also on
Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard a separate case on the limits of NEPA
as it relates to
a<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2024/12/09/utah-colorado-oil-train-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>proposed rail line expansion</u></a> to transport oil from Utah’s
Uinta Basin to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Although the court is
unlikely to issue a decision until next year, its current membership has
shown itself
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-23-supreme-court" target="_self"><u>plenty
willing</u></a> to scrap longstanding precedent in the name of cutting
the regulatory state down to size.
</p>
<p>
Trump did not support his announcement with any additional materials
laying out the legal authorities he plans to exercise to exempt these
projects from regulation or proposed legislation, but it already
attracted criticism from environmentalists, with the Sierra Club
describing it as a “plan to sell out communities and environment to the
highest bidder.It’s also unclear whether Trump was referring to
<em><em>foreign</em></em> direct investment in the United States, of
which there was $177 billion in
2022,<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/data-and-reports/reports/2024/10/foreign-direct-investment-united-states" target="_blank">

Treasury transfers $20 billion in Ukraine loan funds to World Bank</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said it
transferred the $20 billion U.S. portion of a $50 billion G7 loan for
Ukraine to a World Bank intermediary fund for economic and financial
aid.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said the disbursement makes good on its
October commitment to match the European Union’s commitment to provide
$20 billion in aid backed by frozen Russian sovereign assets alongside
smaller loans from Britain, Canada and Japan to help the Eastern
European nation fight Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>The disbursement prior to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration
in January is aimed at protecting the funds from being clawed back by
his administration. Trump has complained that the United States is
providing too much aid to Ukraine and said he will end the war quickly,
without specifying how.</p>
<p>The $50 billion in credit for 30 years will be serviced with the
interest proceeds from some $300 billion in frozen Russian sovereign
assets that have been immobilized since Russia invaded in February 2022.
The Group of Seven democracies have been discussing the plan for months
and agreed on terms in October, prior to Trump’s election.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration initially sought to split the
$20 billion loan in half, with $10 billion to be used for military aid
and $10 billion for economic aid, but the military portion would have
required approval by Congress, a task made more difficult by
Republicans’ sweeping election victory. With Tuesday’s transfer, the
full amount will be devoted to nonmilitary purposes.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the funds were transferred to a new World Bank fund
called the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine
Financial Intermediary Fund. The global lender’s board approved the
creation of the fund in October with only one country, Russia,
objecting.</p>
<p>The bank, whose charter prevents it from handling any military aid,
has run a similar humanitarian and economic intermediary fund for
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally oversaw staff
executing the wire transfer of the $20 billion to the World Bank fund, a
department official said.</p>
<p>“These funds — paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia’s
own immobilized assets — will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of
support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of
aggression,” Yellen said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The $50 billion collectively being provided by the G7 through this
initiative will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to
sustain emergency services, hospitals and other foundations of its brave
resistance,” she said.</p>

designates national monument at site of Carlisle Indian school</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has created a new national monument
on the grounds of a former Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, which
served as the blueprint for hundreds of similar institutions across the
United States.</p>
<p>“I want everyone to know,” Biden said. “I don’t want people
forgetting, 10, 20, 30, 50 years from now.”</p>
<p>Indian children from 140 tribes were taken from their families,
tribes and homelands and forced to spend years at the school in the
borough of Carlisle, he noted.</p>
<p>“It was wrong, and by making the Carlisle Indian School a national
monument, we make clear that [that’s] what great nations do. We don’t
erase history. We acknowledge it. We learn from and we remember, so we
never repeat it again.”</p>
<p>Biden told the 2024 Tribal Nations Summit in Washington Monday that
the monument will encompass 10 hectares (24.5 acres) inside what is
today the Carlisle Army Barracks, including historic buildings and
structures that once made up the school’s campus. These will include the
brick and marble gateposts at the school’s entrance, which Carlisle
students built by hand in 1910.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army will maintain operational control over the site, which
is now home to the U.S. Army War College. The Army will collaborate with
the National Park Service to oversee the planning and management of the
new national monument, consulting with federally recognized tribes to
ensure that the monument accurately reflects historic and contemporary
impacts of the boarding school system on tribal members and
communities.</p>
<p>“This addition to the national park system that recognizes the
troubled history of U.S. and Tribal relations is among the giant steps
taken in recent years to honor Tribal sovereignty and recognize the
ongoing needs of Native communities, repair past damage and make
progress toward healing,” said National Park Service Director Chuck
Sams, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation in Northeast Oregon.</p>
<p>The announcement comes just six weeks after Biden’s visit to the Gila
River Indian Community in Arizona. There, he gave a long-awaited apology
to Native Americans for the boarding school era, calling it “one the
most consequential things I’ve ever had an opportunity to do in my whole
career as president of the United States.”</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland opened the summit with
a speech focusing on the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative she
launched in May 2021.</p>
<p>The initiative resulted in a two-volume report that documented the
history of the school system, accounting for 417 known schools and
confirming more than 900 child deaths.</p>
<p>The initiative also included The Road to Healing, in which Haaland
and Assistant Interior Secretary Bryan Newland traveled to 12 Native
communities, giving survivors and their descendants an opportunity to
share their boarding school experiences.</p>
<p>“So many of you spoke bravely and forthright[ly] … about the horrors
you endured or the trauma that was passed down over generations. Those
stories must continue to be told,” Haaland told the summit leaders.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, the Interior Department engaged the
National Native Boarding School Healing Coalition to conduct video
interviews with boarding school survivors to create a permanent oral
history collection.</p>
<p>Haaland announced that the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s
National Museum of American History will partner to preserve their
accounts for the public.</p>

id="judge-could-permanently-halt-trumps-hush-money-case-while-upholding-his-conviction">Judge
could permanently halt Trump’s hush money case while upholding his
conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prosecutors are urging a judge not to throw out President-elect
Donald Trump’s hush money criminal conviction but suggesting a
willingness to end the case in a way that would preserve the verdict
while avoiding punishment or a protracted legal fight.</p>
<p>In court papers made public on Tuesday, the Manhattan district
attorney’s office proposed an array of options for keeping the historic
conviction on the books, including asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to
consider treating the case the way he would when a defendant dies.</p>
<p>That would effectively put the case into a permanent state of
suspended animation. Trump’s conviction would stand, but everything
would freeze, including any appeal action. It is unclear if that option
is viable under New York law.</p>
<p>“As applied here, this Court could similarly terminate the criminal
proceeding by placing a notation in the record that the jury verdict
removed the presumption of innocence; that defendant was never
sentenced; and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on
appeal because of presidential immunity,” prosecutors wrote in an
82-page filing.</p>
<p>Among the other options prosecutors proposed was delaying sentencing
until after Trump leaves office in 2029. However, they were adamant that
the conviction should stand, arguing that Trump’s impending return to
the White House should not upend a jury’s finding.</p>
<p>The filing expands on the position the prosecutors laid out last
month. Since then, Trump’s lawyers have pressed Merchan to dismiss the
case altogether in light of his election.</p>
<p>The Trump team argues that letting the case continue would present
unconstitutional “disruptions” to his upcoming presidential term. The
attorneys also cited President Joe Biden’s recent pardon of his son
Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. Biden
complained that his son was unfairly prosecuted for political reasons —
and Trump’s lawyers say he was, too.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how soon Merchan may decide what to do next with the
case. Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20.</p>
<p>He had been scheduled for sentencing late last month. But following
Trump’s Nov. 5 election victory, Merchan halted proceedings and
indefinitely postponed the former and future president’s sentencing so
the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the
case.</p>
<p>Merchan also delayed a decision on Trump’s prior bid to dismiss the
case on immunity grounds.</p>
<p>Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34
counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors said he fudged the
documents to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to
suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier.</p>
<p>He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. Trump portrays the
case as a political attack ginned up by D.A. Alvin Bragg and other
Democrats.</p>
<p>A dismissal would erase Trump’s historic conviction, sparing him the
cloud of a criminal record and possible prison sentence. Trump is the
first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first
convicted criminal to be elected to the office.</p>
<p>Merchan could also decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to
sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a
federal appeals court rules on Trump’s parallel effort to get the case
moved out of state court or choose some other option.</p>
<p>The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal
indictments to go to trial.</p>
<p>Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two
federal cases, which pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020
election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at
his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate state election interference case in
Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold. Trump denies wrongdoing in
all.</p>

burn in California as wind-driven wildfire prompts evacuations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — Thousands of Southern California residents were
under evacuation orders and warnings Tuesday as firefighters battled a
wind-driven wildfire in Malibu that burned near seaside mansions and
Pepperdine University, where students sheltering at the school’s library
watched as the blaze intensified and the sky turned deep red.</p>
<p>A “minimal number” of homes burned, but the exact number wasn’t
immediately known, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony
Marrone said. More than 8,100 homes and other structures were under
threat, including more than 2,000 where residents have been ordered to
evacuate. Some 6,000 more people were warned to be prepared to evacuate
at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Ryan Song, a resident assistant at Pepperdine University, said he
first noticed the power went out at his dorm late Monday and then looked
out the window and saw a huge pink glow.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘This is too bright,’ and it got bigger and bigger,” the
20-year-old junior said. “I immediately went outside and saw that it was
a real fire.”</p>
<p>Song and the other resident assistants went door to door, evacuating
students. Most were calm and followed instructions, he said; a few who
were scared rushed to their cars to get off campus.</p>
<p>Song spent the next few hours racing back and forth in the dark
between his dorm and the main campus to ensure no one was left behind as
fire raged down a mountain, he said.</p>
<p>“It felt really close,” he said, adding he was probably less than a
mile away. “Seeing the fire rampaging down the hill is obviously scary
for students, but I felt like our staff was prepared.”</p>
<p>The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past
campus.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how the blaze, named the Franklin Fire,
started. County officials estimated that more than 9 square kilometers
of trees and dry brush had burned. There was no containment.</p>
<p>The fire burned amid dangerous conditions because of notorious Santa
Ana winds expected to last into Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marrone said at least a thousand firefighters would be scrambling to
get a handle on the blaze before 2 p.m., when winds were expected to
regain strength. “Time is of the essence for us to grab ahold of the
fire and start getting some containment,” the chief said at a morning
news conference.</p>
<p>The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday and swiftly moved
south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all
the way to the ocean, where large homes line the beach and inland
canyons are notoriously fire prone. At one point, it threatened the
historic Malibu Pier, but the structure was protected and is intact,
officials said.</p>
<p>Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a
shelter-in-place order on campus. Helicopters dropped water collected
from lakes in the school’s Alumni Park onto the flames.</p>
<p>Firefighters with flashlights and hoses protected nearby homes
overnight, ABC 7 reported. As the sun came up Tuesday, smoke billowed
over the campus and the adjacent mountains that plunge toward the
coast.</p>
<p>North to northeast winds were forecast to increase to 48 to 64 kph
with gusts up to 105 kph expected, the National Weather Service’s office
for Los Angeles posted on social media platform X.</p>
<p>Power to about 40,000 customers had been shut off by Monday night,
including 11,000 in Los Angeles County, as Southern California Edison
worked to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong
gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Email and
phone messages were left with Edison inquiring whether electricity had
been turned off in Malibu before the fire started.</p>
<p>The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three
people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment.</p>
<p>Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the
interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They
typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and
into early spring.</p>

Justice Department ignored some policies when seizing journalists’ phone
records, watchdog finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors ignored some Justice Department
rules when they seized journalists’ phone records as part of media leak
investigations beginning in 2020, according to a report released Tuesday
by the Justice Department inspector general’s office.</p>
<p>The investigation found that the Justice Department during the Trump
administration did not fully comply with the internal guidelines in
place at the time that restricted the department’s use of investigative
tools to seize journalists’ records.</p>
<p>The investigation was launched in 2021 after it was revealed that the
Justice Department had sought records the previous year from reporters
at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.</p>
<p>Press freedom experts find the report’s revelations troublesome.</p>
<p>“It’s very concerning to see this kind of government overreach and
inappropriate use of government power to access journalists’ source
material,” Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S., Canada and Caribbean program
coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA.</p>
<p>“Using journalists as a conduit to find leakers within the federal
government is an incredibly concerning practice,” Jacobsen added.</p>
<p>The report found that the Justice Department in 2020 did not follow
existing department rules that governed searches for reporters’ records,
including failing to convene the News Media Review Committee to consider
the requests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then-Attorney General William Barr, who authorized obtaining records
from news outlets, also did not expressly sign off on the use of
non-disclosure agreements that were sought, which was in conflict with
department policy, the report said.</p>
<p>Press freedom experts say the report’s findings underscore the need
for Congress to pass a proposed federal shield law known as the PRESS
Act.</p>
<p>Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government
to disclose information such as the identities of sources. Nearly every
U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a shield law or court
recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but no federal law is in
place.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passed the PRESS Act in January. An
attempt to pass the PRESS Act via unanimous consent in the Senate failed
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This investigation highlights the need for a reasonable,
common-sense law to protect reporters and their sources,” Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press Executive Director Bruce Brown said
in a statement. “It’s time for Congress to pass the PRESS Act, which has
overwhelming bipartisan support, to prevent government interference with
the free flow of information to the public.”</p>
<p>Although the report details years-old rules-dodging, its contents are
particularly relevant since former President Donald Trump will return to
the White House in just over one month.</p>
<p>The president-elect has pledged to jail journalists who do not name
confidential sources on stories he believes to have national security
implications, and he has suggested that the threat of prison rape would
make them talk.</p>
<p>And Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has said he wants to
“come after” journalists “who lied about American citizens.” He has also
said that the federal government should be rid of “conspirators” against
Trump.</p>
<p>“Using the Justice Department as a way to find leakers in the federal
government is of great concern, and it’s something that we should be
aware of as he comes into office again,” CPJ’s Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration isn’t the only one that has gone after
government leakers. The Obama administration engaged in what CPJ
described as an “aggressive war on leaks.”</p>
<p>Using journalists to target leakers is an issue that has spanned both
political parties, according to Jacobsen. But it’s also “an issue that
both parties can ultimately fix together,” Jacobsen said, including with
the PRESS Act.</p>
<p>The department also went after the records of two members of Congress
and 43 congressional staffers, according to the report.</p>
<p>The congressional staffers were targeted because they had accessed
classified information, even though doing so was part of their job
responsibilities, the report said.</p>

sanctions Chinese cybersecurity firm for ‘malicious’ activities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States slapped sanctions on a Chinese
cybersecurity company and one of its employees Tuesday, accusing it of
compromising more than 80,000 firewalls in a 2020 attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that it had
sanctioned Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company and an
employee named Guan Tianfeng over the April 2020 attack, which targeted
firewalls around the world, including critical infrastructure in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Over a three-day period, Guan exploited a vulnerability in a firewall
product and proceeded to deploy malware against some 81,000 businesses
around the world with the aim of stealing data, including usernames and
passwords, while also attempting to infect the computers with
ransomware, according to the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>More than 23,000 firewalls were in the United States, of which 36
were protecting “critical infrastructure companies’ systems,” the
Treasury said.</p>
<p>“Today’s action underscores our commitment to exposing these
malicious cyber activities … and to holding the actors behind them
accountable for their schemes,” Bradley Smith, Treasury acting
undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The Treasury, he said, “will continue to leverage our tools to
disrupt attempts by malicious cyber actors to undermine our critical
infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Alongside the sanctions, the Department of Justice has also unsealed
an indictment against Guan and announced a reward of up to $10 million
for information about the employee or company, according to the Treasury
Department.</p>

housing supply hiding in plain sight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Empty nesters own prime real estate and lots of it. There are nearly 21
million empty nester households in the U.S., and if they choose to
downsize that could go a ways in addressing the housing shortage, right.
Turns out, location and mortgage rates muddy the answer. Also on this
morning’s show: a scheduled ruling on a potential grocery merger and a
pricey but painless trend in the world of tattooing.

a new design for data centers that reduces water use. The design
“optimizes AI workloads and consumes zero water for cooling,” saving an
estimated 125 million liters of water per year per data center. It does
this by recycling water through a closed loop system, moving it between
the servers and the water chillers. All new Microsoft data center
designs will now be based on this cooling technology, and some pilots
will come online in 2026.

move seems to have angered people on all sides, for many different
reasons. Environmentalists will remember that Biden campaigned on a
promise to stop drilling in the ANWR. “The Arctic Refuge deserves to

id="south-koreas-leadership-crisis-jeopardizes-us-efforts-to-counter-china">South
Korea’s leadership crisis jeopardizes US efforts to counter China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s uncertain
political future from his martial law backlash could imperil the next
Trump administration’s trilateral coordination with the country and
Japan in countering China, analysts say.</p>
<p>Yoon faces an investigation for treason after declaring martial law
and rescinding it hours later last week. Although he survived an
impeachment vote on Saturday, the main opposition Democratic Party said
the following day it would seek an impeachment vote again.</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s leadership and the future leadership of
South Korea amid rapidly evolving political disarray and confusion.</p>
<p>Key government officials have resigned over the martial law
controversy, and the head of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), Han
Dong-hun, said Sunday that Yoon would resign soon and would no longer be
involved in conducting state affairs. In the meantime, the Defense
Ministry said Monday that Yoon still had the control of the South Korean
military.</p>
<p>The South Korean political crisis poses risks to the security of the
region, where countries such as North Korea, China and Russia lie in
wait to take advantage of the situation, analysts say.</p>
<p>“The resulting political turmoil raises uncertainty over the future
direction of the country’s policies and ability to implement them,” said
Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>“The incoming U.S. administration will be focused on countering the
multifaceted Chinese threat to the region and urging allies and partners
to assume larger roles,” he said. “Yoon’s actions will trigger doubts as
to the viability of Seoul’s roles and contributions.”</p>
<p>“Coupled with the Japanese leadership change and loss of legislative
majority by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the United States now
has two weakened allies in Northeast Asia,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba assumed office in October. The
same month, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in
parliament. </p>
<p>On Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs, met with his South Korean and Japanese
counterparts to discuss regional security, underscoring the importance
of maintaining close trilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>The trilateral ties were consolidated after Yoon extended an olive
branch to then- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after years of
frayed relations between the two countries over colonial wartime
issues.</p>
<p>The two countries’ mending of bilateral ties and their subsequent
trilateral summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August 2023, viewed as
historic in Washington, is frowned upon by South Korea’s main opposition
party, which is considered anti-Japan and pro-China.</p>
<p>If the Democratic Party files another impeachment motion and manages
to get two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly and six of nine
constitutional court judges to vote in favor, the country will hold a
special election to choose a new president.</p>
<p>If Yoon resigns or impeachment votes by the parliament and court
pass, the main opposition party has a shot at the country’s next
leadership.</p>
<p>However, how the process will unfold is uncertain as the PPP
boycotted the first impeachment vote and the constitutional court has
three vacancies.</p>
<p>Terence Roehrig, a Korea expert and professor of national security at
the U.S. Naval War College, said, “If Yoon leaves office, either through
impeachment or resignation, the special election that follows will
undoubtedly select a Democratic Party president.”</p>
<p>He continued: “As a result, there is likely to be a shift in South
Korean policy toward China and in maintaining trilateral ties with Japan
and the United States. Much has been done in the past two years to
institutionalize trilateral relations, but these efforts will be tested
with Yoon’s departure along with the incoming Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The PPP criticized Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung for what it
described as his “subservient” attitude toward China when he met with
then-Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming in March.</p>
<p>Lee said at the meeting that South Korea should not be involved in
the cross-strait issue involving Taiwan. China considers the independent
island nation as its own sovereign territory.</p>
<p>Xing in 2023 accused Yoon’s government of tilting too much toward the
U.S. and damaging South Korea’s relations with China.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press
briefing in Beijing on Monday that she will “not comment on the ROK’s
internal affairs,” referring to South Korea by its official name, the
Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation chair in Korea Studies at the
Brookings Institution, said it would not be surprising for China “to
hope for a DP to come back in office,” as during the previous Moon
Jae-in government before Yoon, because the main opposition party is
“more open to engaging China.”</p>
<p>Yeo said that based on President-elect Donald Trump’s key Cabinet
position picks, such as Representative Mike Waltz for national security
adviser and Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, both viewed as
China hawks, countering China will be a key focus, and good ties between
Seoul and Tokyo would be “desirable.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump’s preference to deal bilaterally rather than
with alliances, makes the future of the trilateral ties a bit uncertain,
Yeo said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the Trump administration may be as active as the Biden
administration was in trying to orchestrate and encourage alliances to
work together,” he said.</p>

sect leader sentenced to 50 years in child sex scheme</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20
spiritual “wives” including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years
in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit
to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to
kidnap them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once
led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to
transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to
kidnap some of them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity,
which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count
of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life
imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served
concurrently.</p>
<p>The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the
neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah.
The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially
abandoned polygamy in 1890.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after
hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they
still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The
Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some
appeared to still be minors.</p>
<p>“You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the
opportunity to be around young women,” Brnovich told Bateman, noting
that for a man of his age the 50-year sentence was effectively a life
sentence.</p>
<p>“You took them from their homes, from their families and made them
into sex slaves,” the judge said. “You stripped them of their innocence
and childhood.”</p>
<p>A short competency hearing that was closed to the public was held
just before sentencing to discuss a doctor’s assessment of Bateman’s
mental health. The defense had argued that Bateman could have benefited
from a maximum of 20 years of psychiatric treatment behind bars before
being released.</p>
<p>The girls told the court, sometimes addressing Bateman himself, how
they grappled to develop relationships in high school, among other
struggles. Now living with foster families, they said they had received
much support from trusted adults outside their community.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, the teens hugged and wept quietly. They were
escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the
slogan “Bikers Against Child Abuse,” a group dedicated to protecting
children from what it calls dangerous people and situations. A woman who
sat with the teens said no one in the group would have a comment.</p>
<p>There was no one in the courtroom who appeared to be a supporter of
Bateman.</p>
<p>The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls whom they
claim as spiritual “wives” has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was
convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of
his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs’ trusted followers and
declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a “prophet” of the FLDS. Jeffs
denounced Bateman in a written “revelation” sent to his followers from
prison, and then tried to start his own group.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven
and that he was acting on orders from the “Heavenly Father,” Bateman
began taking female adults and children from his male followers and
proclaiming them to be his “wives,” the plea agreement said. While none
of these “marriages” were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman
acknowledged that each time he claimed another “wife,” it marked the
beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl.</p>
<p>Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess
publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged
from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some
male followers atone for their “sins” by surrendering their own wives
and daughters to him.</p>
<p>Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and
Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual
activity, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some
of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic
devices.</p>
<p>Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove
through Flagstaff, Arizona, pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted
authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of
the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a
makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years
old.</p>
<p>Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of
obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children
were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes.
Authorities also took nine children from Bateman’s home in Colorado City
into protective custody.</p>
<p>Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and
were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle
driven by one of the adult “wives.” Bateman also admitted his
involvement in the kidnapping plot.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman’s plea agreement was
contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also
called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all
assets to be immediately forfeited.</p>
<p>Seven of Bateman’s adult “wives” have been convicted of crimes
related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the
investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to
become Bateman’s spiritual “wives,” witnessed Bateman having criminal
sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving
children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman
is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the
kidnappings.</p>
<p>Two Colorado City brothers also face 10 years to life at their
sentencings, on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20, after being convicted in October of
charges including interstate travel to persuade or coerce a child to
engage in sexual activity. Authorities say one bought Bateman two
Bentley automobiles, while the other bought him a Range Rover.</p>
<p>In court records, lawyers for some of Bateman’s “wives” painted a
bleak picture of their clients’ religious upbringings.</p>
<p>One said his client was raised in a religious cult that taught sexual
activity with children was acceptable and that she was duped into
“marrying” Bateman. Another said her client was given to Bateman by
another man as if she were a piece of property, feeling she had no
choice.</p>

<h2 id="biden-under-pressure-to-commute-federal-death-sentences">Biden
under pressure to commute federal death sentences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden is facing growing calls to
commute the death sentences of the more than three dozen federal inmates
on Death Row before Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>Trump resumed federal executions during his last term in office,
overseeing 13 by lethal injection during his final six months in power,
more than any U.S. leader in 120 years.</p>
<p>Biden campaigned for the White House as an opponent of the death
penalty and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at the
federal level after he became president.</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump spoke
frequently of expanding the use of capital punishment to include
migrants who kill American citizens and drug and human traffickers.</p>
<p>There had been no federal inmates put to death in the United States
since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. </p>
<p>A coalition of death penalty opponents submitted a letter to Biden on
Monday asking him to commute federal death sentences to life in prison
without parole.</p>
<p>“The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect
Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is
commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now,” the
American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and more than 130 other organizations said.</p>
<p>“Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United
States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,”
they said.</p>
<p>There are currently 40 prisoners — all men — convicted of federal
crimes awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, including several in high-profile cases.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<pre><code>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 31, the &quot;Boston Bomber,&quot; who was sentenced to death for the murders of two people in the April 15, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.
Dylann Roof, 30, an avowed white supremacist who shot dead nine Black parishoners during a June 17, 2015 Bible study meeting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Robert Bowers, 52, an anti-Semitic Pennsylvania man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during an October 27, 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Commuted, changed’</p>
<p>Nine of the inmates on federal Death Row were convicted of murdering
fellow prisoners while one killed a prison guard.</p>
<p>Four were sentenced to death for murders committed during bank
robberies.</p>
<p>There are also four inmates on the military’s Death Row including
Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people during a
rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has not carried out an execution since 1961.</p>
<p>Pope Francis, in his Sunday address at the Vatican, asked the crowd
to pray for Death Row inmates in the United States and said their
sentences should “be commuted, changed.”</p>
<p>Biden, who controversially pardoned his son Hunter this month for tax
and gun crimes, has been barraged with clemency appeals from other
religious leaders, former state and federal prison officials,
ex-prosecutors and dozens of relatives of murder victims.</p>
<p>Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, a
former top executive at Facebook, were among the signatories of a letter
from top business leaders urging Biden to exercise his clemency
power.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, the White House is considering
“taking steps to commute at least some federal death sentences.”</p>
<p>“No decision has been made, however, about the breadth or scope of
such a possible move, including whether to do it at all,” the newspaper
said.</p>
<p>There have been 23 executions in the United States in 2024 and two
more are scheduled before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while
six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Tennessee — have moratoriums in place.</p>
<p>Federal executions are carried out by lethal injection at a prison in
Terre Haute, Indiana. The last one was on January 16, 2021, four days
before Trump left office.</p>

id="unitedhealthcare-ceo-was-likely-killed-with-a-ghost-gun-that-can-be-made-at-home">UnitedHealthcare
CEO was likely killed with a ghost gun that can be made at home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was likely
carried out with a ghost gun, one of the nearly untraceable weapons that
can be made a home, police said Monday.</p>
<p>A ghost gun is a firearm without a serial number, and police believe
the one used in last week’s shooting of Brian Thompson may have been
made with a 3D printer. It was capable of firing 9 mm rounds. The man
arrested in the crime, Luigi Mangione, also had a sound suppressor, or
silencer, police said.</p>
<p>Ghost guns have increasingly turned up at crime scenes around the
U.S. in recent years.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the weapons and efforts to regulate them:</p>
<p>What are ghost guns?</p>
<p>The firearms are privately made and have no serial numbers.</p>
<p>Generally, firearms manufactured by licensed companies must have
serial numbers — usually displayed on the frame of the gun — that allow
officials to trace the gun back to the manufacturer, the firearms dealer
and original purchaser.</p>
<p>Ghost guns, however, are made of parts that the owner can assemble
together. The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what
is known as the lower receiver. Some are sold in do-it-yourself kits,
and the receivers are typically made from metal or polymer. They include
semiautomatic handguns and rifles.</p>
<p>Are they legal?</p>
<p>It is legal in the U.S. to build a firearm for personal use. Until
about two years ago, ghost gun kits were available online that allowed
people to assemble the weapons at home without background checks or age
verification.</p>
<p>As police found more ghost guns at crime scenes, the Biden
administration moved to add age requirements and background checks in
2022.</p>
<p>Buying one now is more like purchasing a regular gun at a gun
shop.</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in
several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
Baltimore, according to court documents.</p>
<p>But gun groups have challenged the regulation in court. The Supreme
Court heard a case in October and seemed likely to uphold the
regulation. It hasn’t yet handed down a ruling.</p>
<p>Where else have ghost guns been used?</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement increased from
4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department
data. However, traditional guns are still used far more often in
crimes.</p>
<p>Ghost guns really popped into the public consciousness in 2013 when
John Zawahri opened fire on the campus of Santa Monica College in
California, killing six people, including his father and brother.
Zawahri, who was later shot and killed by police, had assembled an
AR-15-style weapon after failing a background check at a gun dealer.</p>
<p>A gunman who killed his wife and four others in Northern California
in 2017 built his own weapon to skirt a court order prohibiting him from
owning firearms. In 2019, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally
shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>A mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five
people dead in Philadelphia in 2023. A ghost gun was also used in a
shooting that critically wounded two kindergartners at a tiny religious
school in Northern California last week, police said.</p>

<h2 id="biden-memorializes-painful-past-of-native-people">Biden
memorializes painful past of Native people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday presided over his final
White House Tribal Nations Summit by reaching into the nation’s dark
past and establishing a new national monument to honor the suffering of
thousands of Native children and their families in federal boarding
schools in the last century.</p>
<p>His proclamation starts a three-year clock to design a monument to be
placed at the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in 1879, with the stated
mission to “kill the Indian” to “save the Man.” Schools like this
removed children from their families and forced them to speak English,
wear non-native clothing and eschew tribal customs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Biden described the treatment of thousands of
Native children at government boarding schools as “a blot” on the
nation’s history.</p>
<p>“The federal government mandated — mandated — removal of children
from their families and tribes, launching what’s called the federal
Indian boarding school era, over a 150-year span, 150 years from the
early 1800s to 1970 — one of the most horrific chapters in American
history,” he said earlier this year. “We should be ashamed.”</p>
<p>The most recent U.S. Census found that the population of those who
consider themselves wholly or partly Native is upward of nearly 9
million. The U.S. Department of the Interior says it serves 1.9 million
American Indian and Alaska Natives, many in sovereign lands.</p>
<p>That’s a shadow of the population that historians say thrived on the
continent before European colonization. Native Americans were only
granted universal U.S. citizenship in 1924 with the passage of the
Indian Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>Activists like Elveda Martinez of the Walker River Paiute Tribe say
it’s remarkable how recent this history of dispossession and
discrimination is.</p>
<p>“It’s within our generation that Natives finally all had the right to
vote,” she said. “So, that’s still a big thing now. We always tell
people, you know, it was our parents and people in that generation that
fought for the right to vote.”</p>
<p>As a group, Native residents have the highest poverty rate in the
country, and their youth lag behind other demographics in education,
according to a study by a bipartisan research group.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden detailed his administration’s efforts to improve the
livelihoods of descendants of the nation’s pre-colonial populations and
to give communities more say, such as designating conservation areas.
But he stressed that honoring the past is the way forward.“By making the
Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear what great
nations do,” he said. “We don’t erase history. We acknowledge it and
learn from it, so we never repeat it again.”</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as
a Cabinet secretary, praised Biden’s work.</p>
<p>“President Biden has been the best president for Indian Country in my
lifetime,” she said. “This is a president and an administration that
truly sees Indigenous people and has worked tirelessly to address the
issues in Indian Country that have long been underfunded or outright
ignored.”</p>
<p>As a sign of her esteem, Haaland, who is a member of the Pueblo of
Laguna, draped Biden in a personalized parting gift: a black-and-white
version of a blanket designed by Pueblo artist Pat Pruitt, who says the
motif, which depicts thunder and lightning in the desert, is meant to
evoke “the feeling of that calm before the storm that is filled with
electricity and sound.”</p>
<p>But as one tribe made clear Monday, America’s Native people are not a
monolith.</p>
<p>The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lashed out at the Biden
administration for what the group says is a “lack of tribal
consultation” over a wave of proposed off-reservation casinos, including
a recent approval for Oregon’s first off-reservation casino.</p>
<p>“It is performative to celebrate an administration’s contributions to
Indian Country when the actions tell a very different story,” Cow Creek
Umpqua Tribal Chairman Carla Keene said in a statement sent to VOA on
Monday. “We have been dismissed and ignored about policy that will
devastate our social, cultural, and economic livelihood. There is time
to do the right thing and put a stop to the pending decisions that will
irreversibly harm Tribes across the Pacific Northwest and West Coast,
which is a backwards step in American history, not forward.”</p>
<p>The principal chief of the large and powerful Cherokee nation — which
includes about 450,000 people — issued a careful, diplomatic statement
Monday advocating for the summit to continue under the next
administration.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to attending the White House Tribal Nation’s
summit this week,” Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. posted on Facebook. “Other
than when the summit was not held (2017-2020), I’ve been attending since
2013. I hope it is a productive engagement and I hope it continues on in
future years.”</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he views Native issues as
intertwined with energy generation, by naming North Dakota Governor Doug
Burgum as Interior secretary, while also serving as “White House energy
czar.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to do things with energy and with land interior that is
going to be incredible,” he said, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>As president, Trump angered Indigenous activists by lifting a ban on
the Keystone XL pipeline that cuts through sovereign native lands on its
path south from Canada to Texas.</p>
<p>Biden revoked Trump’s permit for the oil pipeline on the first day of
his term.</p>

wary of fissures, fragmentation as Syria looks to rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. diplomats and military officials have intensified
their outreach to groups vying to chart a new course for Syria, as well
as to Syria’s neighbors, in an effort to ensure the fall of the regime
of former President Bashar Assad does not give way to a more unstable
and dangerous future.</p>
<p>A number of key meetings took place Monday in Jordan, where senior
U.S. diplomatic officials held consultations with their Jordanian
counterparts following similar meetings a day earlier in Doha,
Qatar.</p>
<p>And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more diplomatic
missions are in the works.</p>
<p>“Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the
region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States
can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the
future” Blinken told an audience at the State Department Monday.</p>
<p>“This moment presents a historic opportunity, but it also carries
considerable risks,” he said. “History shows how quickly moments of
promise can descend into conflict and violence.”</p>
<p>As evidence of the U.S. concern, the commander of U.S. Central
Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, also engaged
with allies in the region.</p>
<p>General Michael “Erik” Kurilla met in Amman with Major General Yousef
Al-Hunaiti, the chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff.
According to a U.S. readout, Kurilla promised U.S. support for Jordan
should the situation in Syria deteriorate.</p>
<p>Other U.S. officials on Monday likewise emphasized the need for a
calm and orderly transition in Syria.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that our allies are safe and secure,” U.S.
Deputy United Nations Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters at the U.N.
in New York.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that there isn’t a humanitarian catastrophe,”
Wood said. “So, we’re going to be working over the coming days and weeks
to try to make sure that we can ensure all of those things happen.”</p>
<p>But officials at the State Department and the Pentagon caution there
is ample reason to worry that hopes for a better future for the Syrian
people could disintegrate, with differences leading to new waves of
violence and even migrations out of Syria.</p>
<p>They say that while the words and actions of Syrian rebel leaders,
including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s Abu Mohammed al-Golani, seem promising,
pledges for a new, inclusive government will be tested if tensions
between rival groups continue to simmer or escalate.</p>
<p>And the State Department officials said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a
U.S.-designated terror group that grew out of the al-Qaida terror
group’s Syrian affiliate before cutting ties, has yet to show that it
deserves to have the terror designation removed.</p>
<p>So too, there are concerns about the Islamic State terror group,
which commands between 2,500 and 5,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq,
and which has been growing stronger in recent months.</p>
<p>“ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to
create safe havens,” Blinken said Monday, using an acronym for the
terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. “We are determined not to let
that happen.”</p>
<p>U.S. allies on the ground in Syria, however, warn IS has already
begun ramping up its attacks, seeking to take advantage of the collapse
of Syrian regime forces over the past week.</p>
<p>“We are worried,” the U.S. representative for the political wing of
the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told VOA,
pointing to an uptick in attacks across northeastern Syria.</p>
<p>“They are targeting our internal security forces,” said Syrian
Democratic Council representative Sinam Mohamad, noting efforts by IS
sleeper cells in places like Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and even Hasakah, home
to one of the SDF-run prisons holding thousands of IS fighters captured
after the fall of the terror group’s self-declared caliphate in
2019.</p>
<p>She also warned of increased activity, and new escape attempts at
al-Hol, a displaced persons camp that holds tens of thousands of IS
wives and other family members, many of them children.</p>
<p>Mohamad praised U.S. forces for lending support to the SDF but said
there are indications of additional IS activity in areas abandoned by
Syrian regime forces along with their Russian and Iranian allies.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials hope a series of airstrikes, carried out
Sunday at five locations across central Syria, will help to blunt the
threat.</p>
<p>The strikes are “a way to certainly prevent them [IS] from taking
advantage of the dynamics within Syria and the current situation,” said
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters at the Pentagon
Monday.</p>
<p>But U.S. counterterrorism officials have long warned that IS is
capable of demonstrating both patience and resilience and is well-aware
of the types of fissures that could still serve to derail a transition
government in Syria.</p>
<p>And perhaps nowhere are those tensions more palpable at the moment
than in Syria’s northeast, where fighting has broken out between Kurdish
militias and the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of
Turkish-backed militias.</p>
<p>Turkey has defended various efforts to strike at the SDF, claiming it
is led by fighters with the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, a
Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party
(PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>The SDC and SDF, in return, have accused the SNA of attacking
civilians in Manbij, and other nearby areas.</p>
<p>“The United States, now, they are trying to stop this,” the SDC’s
Mohamad told VOA.</p>
<p>“There is some negotiation,” she said. “We hope they [the U.S.] can
succeed in that.”</p>
<p>The State Department Monday said it has been clear with both sides,
echoing warnings from the SDF that ongoing clashes could hurt the
ability of the U.S.-backed force to contain IS.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to see an escalation,” said spokesperson Matthew
Miller of the clashes between Kurdish groups and the SNA. “We don’t want
to see anyone take advantage of this period of instability to try, and
further their own position.”</p>

Media mogul Murdoch fails in bid to change family trust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch has lost a bid to change his family trust to
consolidate control of his media empire in the hands of his son Lachlan,
The New York Times reported Monday, citing a sealed court document. </p>
<p>Nevada Commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded in a decision filed
Saturday that Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, who is the head of
Fox News parent Fox Corp and News Corp, had acted in “bad faith” in
their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, the Times reported. </p>
<p>The court docket indicates Gorman issued a recommendation or order
Saturday, but the document is not publicly available. </p>
<p>The trust currently would divide control of the company equally among
Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence
— after his death. </p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch proposed amending the family trust to solidify
Lachlan’s leadership of the family’s media empire after his death, and
block any interference by three of Lachlan’s siblings, who are
politically moderate, the Times reported. </p>
<p>Under one scenario, three of the heirs could technically outvote a
fourth, setting up a battle over the future of the powerful media
outlets, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox and is sole chair of News
Corp. </p>
<p>In his opinion, Gorman said, the plan to change the trust was a
“carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s
executive roles” inside the empire “regardless of the impacts such
control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries” of the
family trust, the Times said. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said they were
disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal, the Times reported.
The commissioner’s ruling is subject to approval by a district judge,
whose decision could be challenged in court. </p>
<p>The trust was set up in Nevada, which is prized for its strict
confidentiality rules. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch, 93, could not immediately be
reached for comment. Lachlan Murdoch did not respond to an email seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Lachlan’s siblings issued a joint statement expressing hope that the
family would focus on mending relationships. </p>
<p>“We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move
beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding
relationships among all family members,” the siblings said.</p>

Years of Delay Means to an Offshore Wind Project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzOTk2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODQwNzg0OH0._GyqbDXWOLHCu2YdMuM_d1YvkLVolQBQYXFgeyZpMcI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As soon as Donald Trump was declared the winner of November’s
presidential election, climate advocates vowed to continue making
progress at the state and local level. But some local projects may still
depend too much on federal policy to move forward.
</p>
<p>
The president-elect’s influence has already put a highly anticipated
plan to convert New York City’s biggest power plant into a renewable
energy hub on shaky ground. Central to the conversion is a
1,400-megawatt offshore wind farm called Attentive Energy developed by
TotalEnergies. Trump, a longtime critic of the industry, has
<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-wildwood-new-jersey-may-11-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
vague threats</u></a> to “end” offshore wind “on day one.” While that
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/how-will-offshore-wind-fare-under-a-second-trump-term" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overstates
his capabilities</a>, his administration will, at the very least, have
the power to slow the processing of permits.
</p>
<p>
The regulatory uncertainty was enough to convince Patrick Pouyanne, the
CEO of TotalEnergies, to put Attentive Energy on pause, he said at the
Energy Intelligence Forum in London, according to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/total-pauses-new-york-offshore-wind-farm-plans-after-trump-win" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>
— though he left open the possibility of reviving it “in four years.”
</p>
<p>
That’s bad news for the Ravenswood Generating Station in Long Island
City, Queens. Ravenswood consists of three steam turbines built in the
1960s that run mostly on natural gas, though sometimes also on oil, plus
a natural gas combined cycle unit built in 2004. Together, they emitted
nearly 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 in 2023, or about 8% of the city’s
carbon emissions from electricity production, while representing more
than 20% of the city’s local generating capacity. Ravenswood is also
situated across the street from the largest public housing project in
the country, and has spewed pollution into the area colloquially
referred to as “asthma alley” for decades.
</p>
<p>
Rise Light and Power, the company that owns the plant, has said it will
redress those harms to the community by transforming the site into
“Renewable Ravenswood.” The aspiration includes retiring the three
1960s-era generators and replacing them with offshore wind, battery
energy storage, and additional renewable energy delivered from upstate
New York via a new transmission line. Long term, the company says it
will repurpose the plant’s cooling infrastructure to provide clean
heating and cooling to buildings in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Members of the community and local political leaders celebrated the
proposal and showed up at rallies and public hearings to support it.
Rise Light and Power also incorporated clean energy job training into
the plan and earned the support of the union workers who operate the
plant. The environmental group Earthjustice recently cited Renewable
Ravenswood
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024.09.23_earthjusticecomments.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a state filing</u></a> as a shining example of “a more
community-centered approach to energy planning.”
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
for Renewable Ravenswood declares that the plan “starts with offshore
wind,” and
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/initiatives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says</u></a>
that “Attentive Energy One is the first step.” When Attentive Energy
submitted its initial bid for a power contract with the state last year,
Rise Light and Power CEO Clint Plummer
<a href="https://citylimits.org/2023/08/15/citys-largest-power-plant-nears-milestone-in-renewable-energy-push" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the local outlet </u><u><em><em>City Limits</em></em></u></a><em>
</em>that the wind farm “essentially unlocks ‘Renewable Ravenswood.’”
</p>
<p>
Now, it’s unclear when the promised air quality benefits and jobs will
materialize.
</p>
<p>
When I hopped on the phone with Plummer, the Ravenswood CEO, last week,
he downplayed the implications of the pause.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it changes that much,” he told me, stressing that
“project delays don’t impact our commitment to the vision” and that
“it’s simply part of the process of developing these large scale energy
infrastructure projects.” Plummer said the company could continue to
make progress on permitting, engineering, and other related work on the
site and in the community in the meantime. Since New York state has
significantly more control over onshore renewables and transmission, he
said, it may be possible to move more quickly on those.
</p>
<p>
The pause on Attentive Energy may have come with or without Trump — the
project, which is a joint venture between Rise Light and Power,
TotalEnergies, and Corio, had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/new-york-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>withdrawn
its revised bid</u></a> for a contract to sell power into New York’s
energy market in October. When I asked Attentive for clarification,
however, representatives didn’t respond.
</p>
<p>
The wind farm pause is the third big setback to the company’s
replacement plans in as many years.
</p>
<p>
The first effort to bring clean energy to Ravenswood was a 316-megawatt
battery project the New York Public Service Commission approved in 2019.
It was slated to be completed by April 2021, but by January of that
year, the company had
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/lacking-contract-ls-power-delays-major-battery-storage-station-in-ny-62467197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
yet secured an offtake agreement with Con Edison</u></a>, the local
utility, and so asked for a three-year extension. The development still
has not broken ground. “Our project, and most like it that have been
proposed in New York City, are awaiting the State’s expected battery
procurement next year,” a spokesperson told me when I asked for a status
update. “We expect that projects that received State incentives through
that program will likely be able to proceed to construction quickly.”
</p>
<p>
The company also
<a href="https://riselight.com/rise-plans-innovative-solution-to-power-15-of-nyc-with-upstate-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority in May of 2021 to build a transmission line called the
Catskills Renewable Connector that would be capable of delivering 1,200
megawatts of renewable energy from upstate solar and wind farms to the
Ravenswood site, meeting up to 15% of the city’s electricity needs. But
the agency passed over the proposal in favor of two other transmission
lines — Clean Path New York, which would bring renewable power to the
city from Western New York, and the Champlain Hudson Power Express,
which would deliver hydropower from Canada. (While construction on the
latter project is
<a href="https://chpexpress.com/construction-progress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>well
underway</u></a>, Clean Path was cancelled the day before Thanksgiving.)
</p>
<p>
“We weren’t selected then, but we’ve continued to mature and advance
that project,” Plummer told me, regarding the Catskills line. “All these
projects take a very long period of time to realize.”
</p>
<p>
The only aspect of Renewable Ravenswood that’s still alive and kicking,
at least publicly, is the
<a href="https://queensbororenewableexpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Queensborough
Renewable Express</u></a>, a set of high-voltage power lines that would
connect the site to any future offshore wind farms in New York Harbor.
The company is currently awaiting approval on a key permit for the line
from the New York Public Service Commission. But while much of the
project is located within the jurisdiction of New York, part of it will
also need federal approvals.
</p>
<p>
Plummer may not be too concerned about the wind farm’s delay, but a
freeze on offshore wind development for the next four years would
further stretch New York’s already strained climate goals.
</p>
<p>
New York law requires the state to get 70% of its energy from renewable
sources by 2030 and 100% from zero-emissions sources by 2040. The
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/renewables/NYPA-Renewables-Draft-Strategic-Plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
recent progress report</u></a> on those goals, compiled by the New York
Power Authority, found that the state had enough renewable energy
operating and contracted so far to supply about 44% of expected demand
in 2030.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://dps.ny.gov/news/comments-sought-regarding-clean-energy-standard-biennial-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>separate
state analysis</u></a> showed that offshore wind would play a key role
in reaching the target, with an expected 6 gigawatts of offshore wind
generation getting New York about 15% of the way there. But so far, the
state has finalized contracts for only about 1.7 gigawatts. Though New
York has several additional contracts pending awards, none of those
potential projects has yet submitted construction plans to the federal
Bureau of Ocean Management. If that office freezes its offshore wind
work for the next four years, it’s possible none of them will be able to
start construction until the 2030s at the earliest.
</p>
<p>
“Four years may not be significant for project development time frames,”
Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy advisor for the city of
New York, told me. “But the state has these 2030 and 2040 goals, and so
many pieces of what makes up the ability to hit those goals are under
stress. So it’s certainly not good news.”
</p>
<p>
New Yorkers aren’t the only ones who will be affected by the pause.
Attentive Energy was also working on two additional offshore wind
projects that would send power to New Jersey. The developer had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energy-two-celebrates-award-of-offshore-wind-contract-to-deliver-1-3-gw-of-clean-energy-and-thousands-of-jobs-into-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secured
a contract</u></a> to sell power into that state from a 1.3-gigawatt
project called Attentive Energy Two. In July, it
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energys-proposal-to-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to New Jersey’s fourth offshore wind solicitation for an
additional, unnamed 1.3-gigawatt project. The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities is expected to reach a decision on that solicitation this
month.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to TotalEnergies to ask whether all three projects were
paused or just the New York one, but the company said it would not
comment on Pouyanne’s speech. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
also did not respond as to whether Attentive had pulled either its
awarded contract or bid.
</p>
<p>
It’s true that developing these projects takes a long time, and that
anyone excited about Renewable Ravenswood should not have expected any
new clean power to come into the site until the end of this decade,
anyway. But further delays could have real consequences. “Any of these
projects faltering is just going to keep New York City reliant on an
aging and dirty fossil fleet,” said Zarrilli. The city is in a hole, he
said, after the Indian Point nuclear plant closed and made it even more
reliant on natural gas for electricity.
</p>
<p>
On my call with Plummer, he emphasized several times that the city has
“the thinnest reserve margins we’ve had in decades” — in other words, it
doesn’t have much wiggle room to meet increases in electricity demand.
Rise Light and Power has already shut down 17 small gas “peaker” plants
that were previously part of Ravenswood to make room for new renewable
energy infrastructure. The city will be in better shape in 2026,
assuming the Champlain Hudson Power Express finishes on time,
<a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2248793/2024-RNA-Report.pdf/0fe6fd1e-0f28-0332-3e80-28bea71a2344?t=1732195607468" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the New York grid operator NYISO</u></a>. But by the early 2030s,
when additional peaker plants are expected to be shut down due to
pollution regulations, New York could be back on thin ice.
</p>
<p>
By then, the steam turbines at Ravenswood will be nearly 70 years old.
Unless significant additional generation comes online by then, Rise
Light and Power could be forced to re-invest in those gas generators
rather than retire them. “It’d be terrible if they were forced to make
that choice in the future,” said Zarrilli.

in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing charged with murder in New York, court
records show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Altoona, Pennsylvania — After UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was gunned down
on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs,
drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city’s muscular surveillance
system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet
addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.</p>
<p>When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative
efforts shared credit with an alert civilian’s instincts. A Pennsylvania
McDonald’s customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the
oblique security camera photos that New York police had publicized.</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a
prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the
killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States’ largest
medical insurance companies.</p>
<p>He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged
with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false
identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had
added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He’s
expected to be extradited to New York eventually.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the
allegations. Asked at Monday’s arraignment whether he needed a public
defender, Mangione asked whether he could “answer that at a future
date.”</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald’s
customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.
Police in Altoona, about 375 kilometers west of New York City, were soon
summoned.</p>
<p>They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the
restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop,
according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione
whether he’d been to New York recently, he “became quiet and started to
shake,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>When he pulled his mask down at officers’ request, “we knew that was
our guy,” rookie Officer Tyler Frye said at a news conference in
Hollidaysburg.</p>
<p>New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news
conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill
Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New
York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a
three-page, handwritten document that shows “some ill will toward
corporate America.”</p>
<p>A law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed
to have acted alone.</p>
<p>“To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do
for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly
that I wasn’t working with anyone,” the document said, according to the
official.</p>
<p>It also had a line that said, “I do apologize for any strife or
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it
coming.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was
found with a passport and $10,000 in cash — $2,000 of it in foreign
currency. Mangione disputed the amount.</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a
midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came
to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to
wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.</p>
<p>Investigators have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on
ammunition found near Thompson’s body. The words mimic a phrase used to
criticize the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the
shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a
northern Manhattan bus terminal.</p>
<p>Once in Pennsylvania, he went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,
“trying to stay low-profile” by avoiding cameras, Pennsylvania State
Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.</p>
<p>A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and
philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state
legislator. Mangione was valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep
school, where his 2016 graduation speech lauded his classmates’
“incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.”</p>
<p>He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer
science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s
family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his
cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione. “We offer our prayers to the
family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all
involved.”</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione worked for a time for the car-buying website
TrueCar and left in 2023, CEO Jantoon Reigersman said by email.</p>
<p>From January to June 2022, Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a “co-living”
space at the edge of Honolulu tourist mecca Waikiki.</p>
<p>Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote
workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a
spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.</p>
<p>“Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no
complaints,” Ryan said. “There was no sign that might point to these
alleged crimes they’re saying he committed.”</p>
<p>At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from
childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to
romance, Ryan said.</p>
<p>“He went surfing with R.J. once but it didn’t work out because of his
back,” Ryan said, but noted that Mangione and Martin often went together
to a rock-climbing gym.</p>
<p>Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said,
then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.</p>
<p>Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.</p>
<p>Although the gunman obscured his face during the shooting, he left a
trail of evidence in New York, including a backpack he ditched in
Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, a water bottle
and a protein bar wrapper.</p>
<p>In the days after the shooting, the NYPD collected hundreds of hours
of surveillance video and released multiple clips and still images in
hopes of enlisting the public’s eyes to help find a suspect.</p>
<p>“This combination of old-school detective work and new-age technology
is what led to this result today,” Tisch said at the New York news
conference.</p>

id="veteran-daniel-penny-is-acquitted-in-nyc-subway-chokehold-case-over-jordan-neelys-death">Veteran
Daniel Penny is acquitted in NYC subway chokehold case over Jordan
Neely’s death</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A Marine veteran who used a chokehold on an agitated
subway rider was acquitted on Monday in a death that became a prism for
differing views about public safety, valor and vigilantism. </p>
<p>A Manhattan jury cleared Daniel Penny of criminally negligent
homicide in Jordan Neely’s 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter
charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that
count. </p>
<p>Penny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly
smiled as the verdict was read. Both applause and anger erupted in the
courtroom, and Neely’s father and two supporters were ushered out after
audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears. </p>
<p>“It really, really hurts,” Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, said
outside the courthouse. “I had enough of this. The system is
rigged.” </p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the Democrat whose office
brought the case, said prosecutors “followed the facts and the evidence
from beginning to end” and respect the verdict. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from lawyers for Penny, who rushed to
a waiting car after the verdict. The anonymous jury, which had started
deliberating Tuesday, was escorted out of court to a van. </p>
<p>Penny’s attorneys had said he was protecting himself and other subway
passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming
remarks and gestures. </p>
<p>The case amplified many American fault lines, among them race,
politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was
Black. Penny is white. </p>
<p>There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse,
including Monday, when chants could be heard through the courtroom
window ahead of the verdict. High-profile Republican politicians
portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely’s
funeral. </p>
<p>Penny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study
architecture. </p>
<p>Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story:
His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a
teenager. </p>
<p>As a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes — complete with
moonwalks — on the city’s streets and subways. But Neely also struggled
with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was
convicted of murdering her. </p>
<p>He subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was
repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and
realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to
medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he
died. </p>
<p>Neely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty
and having to “dig through the garbage” for food made him feel so
hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records
show. </p>
<p>About six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1,
2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry
and thirsty and didn’t care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said.
Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he’d
harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid. </p>
<p>Neely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and
didn’t touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that
alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him. </p>
<p>Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor
and “put him out,” as the veteran told police at the scene. </p>
<p>Passengers’ video showed that at one point during the roughly
six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker’s leg and gestured to him.
Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute
before Penny released him. </p>
<p>“He’s dying,” an unseen bystander said in one video. “Let him
go!” </p>
<p>A witness who stepped in to hold down Neely’s arms testified that he
told Penny to free the man, though Penny’s lawyers noted the witness’
story changed significantly over time. </p>
<p>Penny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely
threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to
“de-escalate” the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said
he held on as long as he did because Neely periodically squirmed. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t trying to injure him. I’m just trying to keep him from
hurting anyone else. He’s threatening people. That’s what we learn in
the Marine Corps,” Penny told the detectives. </p>
<p>However, one of Penny’s Marine Corps instructors testified that the
veteran misused a chokehold technique he’d been taught. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he
perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any
need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at
the next station, seconds after Penny took action. </p>
<p>Although Penny himself told police he’d used “a choke” or “a
chokehold,” one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a
Marine-taught chokehold “modified as a simple civilian restraint.” The
defense lawyers contended that Penny didn’t consistently apply enough
pressure to kill Neely. </p>
<p>Contradicting a city medical examiner’s finding, a pathologist hired
by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the
combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a
blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during
exertion. </p>
<p>Penny did not testify, but several of his relatives, friends and
fellow Marines did — describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and
empathetic man. </p>
<p>The manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny
recklessly caused Neely’s death. Criminally negligent homicide involves
engaging in serious “blameworthy conduct” while not perceiving such a
risk. Both charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison
time. </p>
<p>While the criminal trial played out, Neely’s father filed a wrongful
death suit against Penny.</p>

asks federal appeals court to bar enforcement of potential ban until
Supreme Court review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden
administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the
popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the
statue. </p>
<p>The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same
court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which
requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a
ban as soon as next month, was constitutional. </p>
<p>If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance,
which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app
will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million
American users. </p>
<p>“Before that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity,
as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to
decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,” attorneys
for the two companies wrote in the legal filing on Monday. </p>
<p>It’s not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time
he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action. </p>
<p>In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political
realities, saying that an injunction would provide a “modest delay” that
would give “the incoming Administration time to determine its position —
which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court
review.”</p>

Perez,’ ‘The Brutalist’ lead Golden Globe film nominations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — Musical thriller “Emilia Perez” and
historical epic “The Brutalist” led the roster of films nominated on
Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off
the movie awards season leading to the Oscars.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez,” released by Netflix NFLX.O, scored 10 nods and “The
Brutalist,” from independent distributor A24, earned seven.</p>
<p>Taking home a Globe can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards
in March. Last year’s Hollywood strikes scrambled this year’s release
schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best
picture at the Oscars.</p>
<p>The Globe winners will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists
from 85 countries and will be announced Jan. 5 at a ceremony broadcast
live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez” stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a drug cartel
leader (Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón) fake his death and transition
from a man to a woman. Selena Gomez co-stars as the cartel leader’s
wife. All three were nominated for by Globes voters for acting
honors.</p>
<p>“The Brutalist” stars Adrien Brody in an epic tale of a Hungarian
immigrant who flees the horrors of World War Two to rebuild his life in
the United States.</p>
<p>Box office smash “Wicked,” adapted from a long-running Broadway play
about the witches in “The Wizard of Oz,” landed four nominations.</p>

Over the last 30 years, large swathes of land that were once lush and

ecosystems, according to a

report on global aridity</a> from the UN Convention to Combat
Desertification. The study found that more than 75% of all land on Earth
has become drier over the last three decades, and that during that time,
drylands expanded by an area the size of the Australian continent to
cover 40% of all the global land (excluding Antarctica). This is a very
bad trend. Aridity is different from drought. While drought eventually
recedes, aridity is “an unrelenting menace,” leading to land
degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity decline, crop losses, and
large-scale human migration. Human-caused climate change is the main
cause of the aridity crisis. “If the world fails in efforts to curb
greenhouse gas emissions,” the UN warned, “another 3% of the world’s
humid areas are projected to transform into drylands by the end of this
century.”

<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The Assad family ruled Syria for more than half a century, and that
dynasty has come to an end. The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or
HTS, is consolidating control and will inherit an economy devastated by
a decade of brutal civil war that cost 500,000 lives. What could
economic recovery look like? Then, China preps for a U.S. trade war
under Trump, and global criminals utilize cryptocurrency to launder
money.

id="polarization-is-merriam-websters-2024-word-of-the-year">‘Polarization’
is Merriam-Webster’s 2024 word of the year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the
country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for
celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the
Merriam-Webster word of the year is “polarization”?</p>
<p>“Polarization means division, but it’s a very specific kind of
division,” said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor at large, in
an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s
announcement. “Polarization means that we are tending toward the
extremes rather than toward the center.”</p>
<p>The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls
with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to
the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000
voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat
concerned that Donald Trump’s views — but not Harris’ — were too
extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris
— but not Trump.</p>
<p>The Merriam-Webster entry for “polarization” reflects scientific and
metaphorical definitions. It’s most commonly used to mean “causing
strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.”</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its
site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in
search and usage.</p>
<p>Last year’s pick was “authentic.” This year’s comes as large swaths
of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.</p>
<p>“It’s always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind
of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,” Sokolowski
said. “It’s a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news,
alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word’s
meaning in the culture.”</p>
<p>It’s notable that “polarization” originated in the early 1800s — and
not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about
science, Sokolowski said. He called it a “pretty young word,” in the
scheme of the English language. “Polarized is a term that brings
intensity to another word,” he continued, most frequently used in the
U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.</p>
<p>“The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,”
the Merriam-Webster editor continued. “We’ve had dictionaries of English
for 420 years and it’s only been in the last 20 years or so that we’ve
actually known which words people look up.”</p>
<p>“Polarization” extends beyond political connotations. It’s used to
highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends
and other industries.</p>
<p>All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift’s private jet usage? Polarizing.
Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The
International Olympic Committee’s decision to strip American gymnast
Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it:
polarizing.</p>
<p>Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian
breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn’s performance — or the proliferation
of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved
polarizing.</p>
<p>Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word
itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the
political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and
CNN.</p>
<p>“It’s used by both sides,” he said, “and in a little bit ironic twist
to the word, it’s something that actually everyone agrees on.”</p>
<p>Rounding out Merriam-Webster’s top 10 words of 2024:</p>
<p>Demure</p>
<p>TikToker Jools Lebron’s 38-second video describing her workday makeup
routine as “very demure, very mindful” lit up the summer with memes. The
video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding “huge spikes”
in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means
reserved or modest.</p>
<p>Fortnight</p>
<p>Taylor Swift’s song “Fortnight,” featuring rapper Post Malone,
undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks.
“Music can still send people to the dictionary,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Totality</p>
<p>The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are
tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico’s
Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of
totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully
blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate
amount — or wholeness.</p>
<p>Resonate</p>
<p>“Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of
the word ‘resonate,’” Sokolowski said. This may be because the word,
which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional
way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial
intelligence “also betrays itself to be a robot because it’s using that
word too much.”</p>
<p>Allision</p>
<p>The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March,
a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. “When you
have one moving object into a fixed object, that’s an allision, not a
collision. You’re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in
fact, in motion,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Weird</p>
<p>This summer on the TV news show “Morning Joe,” Minnesota Gov. Tim
Walz called Republican leaders “weird.” It may have been what launched
his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential
nominee. Though it’s a word that people typically misspell — is it “ei”
or “ie”? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable,
Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Cognitive</p>
<p>Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe
Biden’s debate performance or Trump’s own age, it cropped up often. It
refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning,
or remembering.</p>
<p>Pander</p>
<p>Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said.
“Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to
different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights
supporters.” Whereas Walz said Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s kitchen
pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what
someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not
“good, proper, reasonable, etc.”</p>
<p>Democracy</p>
<p>In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make “democracy” its first word
of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of
government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions,
policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary’s most looked
up. “There’s a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,”
Sokolowski said. “Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the
public shows, is that they’re paying attention.”</p>

<p>Both U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump

Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests
are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday
evening in Washington. </p>
<p>This year’s recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic
accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the
Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter
Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo,
which has launched generations of Black artists, is being
recognized. </p>
<p>There will be personalized tributes with performances and
testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the
traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. </p>
<p>The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients
themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her
longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on
stage to perform Cher’s hit, “If I Could Turn Back Time.” </p>
<p>Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past
tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. </p>
<p>Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese’s induction in
2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet
legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy
and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the
1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in
a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. </p>
<p>The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial
to the band’s founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age
84. </p>
<p>This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without
political intrigue for a while. </p>
<p>During Republican Donald Trump’s first four years in office, Kennedy
Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the
tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy
toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear
threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who
takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his
first term. </p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for
the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center
ceremony afterward. </p>
<p>The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.</p>

id="biden-assads-syrian-collapse-a-fundamental-act-of-justice">Biden:
Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of
the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a “fundamental act of
justice,” but that it was “a moment of uncertainty” for the Mideast.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the
decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was “the best opportunity in
a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.”</p>
<p>Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two
years weakened Syria’s backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported
Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that “for the first time”
they could no longer defend the Assad government.</p>
<p>“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,”
Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the
White House.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his
country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, “was not interested in protecting
him any longer.”</p>
<p>Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he
decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in
Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, “THIS IS
NOT OUR FIGHT.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according
to Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with
Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S.
forces on Sunday conducted “dozens” of what he called “precision
airstrikes” on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria.</p>
<p>Biden said the U.S. is “clear eyed” that ISIS will try to take
advantage of the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a
terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat
Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida.</p>
<p>“We will remain vigilant,” Biden said. “Make no mistake, some of the
rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of
terrorism and human rights abuses.” He added that the groups are “saying
the right things now.”</p>
<p>“But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just
their words, but their actions,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and
Russia’s war in Ukraine, noting that Assad’s allies in Moscow, as well
as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, “are in a weakened
state right now.”</p>
<p>Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq,
wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the
insurgents.</p>
<p>“Many of ‘the rebels’ are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope
they’ve moderated. Time will tell,” he said.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S.
journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him.</p>
<p>“To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that
we’re waiting for Austin,” Tice’s mother, Debra, said in comments that
hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. “We know that when he
comes out, he’s going to be fairly dazed &amp; he’s going to need lots
of care &amp; direction. Direct him to his family please!”</p>
<p>Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus.</p>
<p>“We’ve remained committed to returning him to his family,” Biden told
reporters. “We believe he’s alive, we think we can get him back, but we
have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held
accountable.”</p>
<p>The president added: “We have to identify where he [Tice] is.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="trump-picks-lawyer-to-serve-as-counselor-to-the-president">Trump
picks lawyer to serve as counselor to the president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that
he had chosen Alina Habba, his personal attorney, to serve as counselor
to the president.</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Habba a “tireless
advocate for justice.”</p>
<p>“She has been unwavering in her loyalty and unmatched in her resolve
— standing with me through numerous ‘trials,’ battles and countless days
in Court,” Trump said. “Few understand the Weaponization of the
‘Injustice’ System better than Alina.”</p>
<p>Trump announced several other planned additions to his
administration, including Christopher Landau as his choice to serve as
deputy secretary of state. Landau was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Trump also said former National Security Council spokesman Michael
Anton will serve as the director of policy planning at the State
Department, while Michael Needham will serve as counselor of the State
Department.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Trump vowed to make swift and sweeping changes as he
takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the
country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise
consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend
his 2020 reelection loss. </p>
<p>Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the
White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making
him only the second American president elected to a second,
nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>“People like me now, you know?” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an
interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday.</p>
<p>“It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time
[in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,” he said. “And one thing
that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the
popular vote, and by a lot,” with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his
defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots
that were cast.</p>
<p>But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances,
refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election
to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent
balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in
his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a
month ago, Trump said, “Because I think it was too big to rig.”</p>
<p>Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped
insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of
Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the
January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying
to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020
election.</p>
<p>He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the
investigative panel “political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what
they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”</p>
<p>Trump said that on his first day in office he would be “acting very
quickly” to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an
array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them
have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to
go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as
“hostages” and called them “patriots.”</p>
<p>“These people are living in hell,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate Biden. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said.
“Retribution will be through success.”</p>
<p>But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida
state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal
political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy
in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special
counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as “very corrupt.”</p>
<p>Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S.
border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First
will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump
officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the
first to be deported.</p>
<p>“I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing
to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules,
regulations, laws. They came in illegally,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status,
where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. “I
don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break
up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all
back,” he declared.</p>
<p>Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive
deportation plan does not faze him.</p>
<p>“You have no choice,” he said. “First of all, they’re costing us a
fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it.
And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it
goes.”</p>
<p>But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to
exempt so-called “dreamers” from deportation, young children who were
brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little
connection to their native countries.</p>
<p>He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the
U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees
citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of
their parents being in the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on
imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico
and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not “guarantee American
families won’t pay more” as a result of his plan.</p>
<p>“I can’t guarantee anything,” Trump said. “I can’t guarantee
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, “if I
can.” He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his
administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in
September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.</p>

id="moana-2-cruises-to-another-record-weekend-600-million-globally">‘Moana
2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s animated film “Moana 2” remained at the top of
the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in
another record haul. </p>
<p>The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original,
and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.</p>
<p>The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following
Thanksgiving weekend, unseating “Frozen II,” which earned $35.2 million
in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for
inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, “Moana 2” has
already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year.
Its performance means Disney has three films in this year’s top five,
including “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.” The studio also
has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins’
“Mufasa,” out Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s
horror comedy “Y2K” and the Jude Law crime thriller “The Order.” But
nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the
enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, “Moana 2,” “Wicked” and “Gladiator
II.”</p>
<p>Second place at the box office was occupied by “Wicked,” which added
$34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three
weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at
$455.6 million. “Gladiator II” followed in third place with $12.5
million, while “Red One” came in fourth with $7 million.</p>
<p>“These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put
an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,” said Paul
Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie
business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number
was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and
up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for
the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the
deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. </p>
<p>The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th
anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which
played in only 165 theaters, did better than “Y2K” ($2.1 million) and
“The Order” ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science
fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in
an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX
presentations of “Interstellar” were sold out through the weekend.</p>
<p>“I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original
IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend,” Nolan said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic “Pushpa:
The Rule – Part 2,” which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll’s
anime release, “Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,” made $2.4 million. Fathom
also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s “A Drummer Boy Christmas”
concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.</p>
<p>“It’s a really diverse marketplace,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s
event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film.
It’s easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever
seen.”</p>
<p>Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies,
with both Sony’s comic book film “Kraven the Hunter” and the animated
“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” opening in wide
release. Awards contenders “Nickel Boys” and “September 5” will also
open in a limited number of theaters.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in
Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an
immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with
French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv “would like to make a deal”
to end the more than 1,000-day war. </p>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and
Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that
“should never have started.” </p>
<p>“There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should
begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families
destroyed,” he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to
act to bring the fighting to an end. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel
Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as “constructive”. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any
peace deal “should be just” for Ukrainians, “so that Russia and Putin or
any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.” </p>
<p>In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that
Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow’s all-out invasion on
Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. </p>
<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official
casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few
months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant
record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded
each month.</p>

oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe
age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials
said. </p>
<p>The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to
Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the
Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg,
the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said in a
Facebook post this week. </p>
<p>Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the
Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate
for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for
several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she
returned last week, officials said. </p>
<p>“We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,” Jonathan Plissner,
supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge,
said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the
refuge to nest and raise their young. </p>
<p>Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months.
Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They
spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and
fish eggs. </p>
<p>Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as
30 chicks, Plissner said. </p>
<p>The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

id="as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows">As
data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the
rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia.
He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes
and neighbors wave hello.</p>
<p>But now, as he’s approaching 60, he’s considering selling his Fairfax
County home and moving away. That’s because he’s getting a new neighbor:
Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical
substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds
and a community center.</p>
<p>Newman feels helpless to stop it.</p>
<p>“I planned on staying here until I died,” he said, “until this came
up.”</p>
<p>The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed
servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and
computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape,
popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.</p>
<p>Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid
growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local
governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.
But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas,
abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents
are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over
concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their
communities.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight
against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough
to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to
homes.</p>
<p>“All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in
this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn’t
run residents away from their homes,” he said.</p>
<p>Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia</p>
<p>In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling
hills of the area’s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular
Washington &amp; Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data
centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation’s
capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.</p>
<p>Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on
neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners
association in the community.</p>
<p>The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm
founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials
promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent
positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction
and electrical jobs to build the facility.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022,
hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green
space.</p>
<p>But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping
out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for
the Plaza 500 project.</p>
<p>When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held
protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to
their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were
largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in
September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter
zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under
the old rules.</p>
<p>Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the
already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia
in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by
2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates
also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every
day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray
also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help
power the data centers’ hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this
story.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how a general resident, even someone who has been
engaging intently on an issue,” Ray said, “has any chance to go up
against the data center industry.”</p>
<p>Local leaders say data centers a financial boon</p>
<p>For local governments, attracting data centers to their
municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said
in 2024 that Virginia’s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in
tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech
companies that own them in 2023.</p>
<p>For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of
direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently
that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000
residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center
advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction,
technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In
that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730
indirect jobs.</p>
<p>Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her
estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax
County should reap the benefits.</p>
<p>“I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the
big picture,” Smith said. “Data centers are not going away.”</p>
<p>Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon </p>
<p>On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon
Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the
4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland
flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia
river.</p>
<p>Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in
property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a
$66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in
two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another
$1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.</p>
<p>That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and
bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a
new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras,
and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.</p>
<p>Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals.
Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials
allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a
company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the
data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics
complaint against them.</p>
<p>Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the
relationships between the company and local officials, and raised
eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an
estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build
five new data centers.</p>
<p>Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS
officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant
in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.</p>
<p>The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a
commissioner. “They said, ‘Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what
you need. Tell us what we can do for you,’” Doherty recalled. Other
former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS
didn’t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.</p>
<p>“We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate
around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a
community’s goals,” said Kevin Miller, AWS’ Vice President of global
data centers. “This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve
those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good
neighbors.”</p>
<p>Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said
they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new
data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to
negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of
AWS-suited lawyers.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to blow it up. We didn’t want to run them off,” said
Lindsay. “But there were better deals to be made.”</p>
<p>Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their
direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.</p>
<p>“This road right here? Wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t for AWS,” said
Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe’s cruiser, pointing out
the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.
Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to
authorize tax breaks for AWS.</p>
<p>“These companies would not be here if they weren’t getting some kind
of incentive,” Stokoe said. “There wouldn’t be any money to talk
about.”</p>

House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in
Syria now are to ensure the country’s conflict does not encourage a
resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a
“humanitarian catastrophe.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the
“extraordinary events in Syria” are in touch with regional partners, the
White House said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the
extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with
regional partners,” the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Spillover “is a concern,” said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also
known as ISIS.</p>
<p>In previous phases of Syria’s long-running civil war, “at its worst,
we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,” he said at a conference in
Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum.</p>
<p>The main priority is to ensure “that the fighting in Syria not lead
to a resurgence of ISIS,” Sullivan said. “We are going to take steps
ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the
Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working
with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the
AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would
affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. “It’s still too
early to tell,” he said.</p>
<p>What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in
Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the
Reagan event.</p>
<p>Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they
have begun to encircle Syria’s capital, Damascus.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies
Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, “who would potentially
face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we’re in
touch with them every day.”</p>
<p>Washington is also alert to stopping a “humanitarian catastrophe,
both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in
terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,”
Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to
take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying … to reconstitute to
a certain extent.”</p>
<p>So the United States will seek to “contain the potential violence and
instability,” protect allies and ensure that ISIS not “get new oxygen
out of this” that could lead them to threaten US or allies’ interests,
Sullivan added.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of
power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated
Biden in November’s election.</p>
<p>Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement
in Syria, saying the country is “a mess” and “not our friend.”</p>
<p>“THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Sullivan, addressing Trump’s remarks, agreed, saying “the United
States is not going to… militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian
civil war.”</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms
equipment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next
week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for
U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms
firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to
address security risks.</p>
<p>The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other
provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese
efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence
assessment of the current status of China’s biotechnology
capabilities.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure
equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously
only approved $1.9 billion for the “rip and replace” program.</p>
<p>Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and
other Chinese gear from their wireless networks.</p>
<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S.
Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to
replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion
shortfall “putting both our national security and the connectivity of
rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.”</p>
<p>She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural
networks shutting down, which “could eliminate the only provider in some
regions” and could threaten 911 service.</p>
<p>Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised
the announcement, saying “funding is desperately needed to fulfill the
mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while
maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that
receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms
equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the
program.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the
program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by
funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced
wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising
spectrum demands of wireless consumers.</p>

id="pearl-harbor-survivors-ages-104-and-102-return-to-hawaii-for-attack-anniversary">Pearl
Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack
anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira “Ike” Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor
attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a
remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that
thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six
weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his
right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a
submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him
from either side.</p>
<p>“I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,” he
said afterward. “I’m getting old, you know.”</p>
<p>Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who
made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National
Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor
had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health
issues.</p>
<p>The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen.
Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS
Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900
Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.</p>
<p>Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has
declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living,
according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state
chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military
historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000
military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.</p>
<p>Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to
salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans.</p>
<p>“He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,” said his daughter
Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their
Beaverton, Oregon, home. “He wanted to be able to stand for that.”</p>
<p>Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack,
serving as the tuba player in the ship’s band. He had showered and put
on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party.</p>
<p>He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS
Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of
sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside.</p>
<p>Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the
ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due
to health issues.</p>
<p>Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time
the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation
flew overhead shortly after.</p>
<p>Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he
lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as
the attack began.</p>
<p>“When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,”
Fernandez said. “We didn’t even know we were in a war.”</p>
<p>Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was
to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast.
Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a
plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly
by.</p>
<p>Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and
other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing
12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to
the ship’s guns.</p>
<p>He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow
sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.</p>
<p>“I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going
on,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>The ship’s guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its
cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into
the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on
fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.</p>
<p>Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its
sailors were injured.</p>
<p>Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t
view himself that way.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hero,” he said. “I’m just nothing but an ammunition
passer.”</p>

id="garlands-ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-auctioned-for-28m">Garland’s
ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ auctioned for $28M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy
Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades
ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or
more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55
million, or $1.91 million including the buyer’s premium, a commission
that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the
Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the
slippers, and the company’s web page for the auction had hit nearly
43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it,
the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen “more twists
and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.”</p>
<p>They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of
Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to
smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case.</p>
<p>Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in
2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota,
wasn’t publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023.
He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on
supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served
because of his poor health.</p>
<p>His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin,
who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was
attempting to pull off “one last score” after an old associate with
connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real
jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person
who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass,
DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn’t
specify how.</p>
<p>The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis
suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair
and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He’s scheduled to
go on trial in January and hasn’t entered a plea, though his attorney
has said he’s not guilty.</p>
<p>The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael
Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs
that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to
have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to
click her heels three times and repeat, “There’s no place like
home.”</p>
<p>Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand
Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival
to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to
help the museum purchase the slippers.</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with
the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway
musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
<p>The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz,
such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>

<h2 id="us-announces-nearly-1-billion-in-military-aid-for-ukraine">US
announces nearly $1 billion in military aid for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Saturday announced a new $988
million military assistance package for Ukraine as Washington races to
provide aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes
office. </p>
<p>It nearly halves the available $2.21 billion remaining in Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) as the Biden administration works
to commit to buying weapons from industry, rather than pull from U.S.
weapons stocks. </p>
<p>Trump’s victory in the November election has cast doubt on the future
of American aid for Ukraine, providing a limited window for billions of
dollars in already authorized assistance to be provided before he is
sworn in next month.  </p>
<p>The package features drones, ammunition for precision HIMARS rocket
launchers, and equipment and spare parts for artillery systems, tanks
and armored vehicles, the Pentagon said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has often used Presidential Drawdown
Authority, which authorizes President Joe Biden to transfer excess
articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval
during an emergency. </p>
<p>The USAI funds are separate and will go to purchase new weapons from
the defense industry or partners rather than drawn from American stocks,
meaning it will not immediately arrive on the battlefield. </p>
<p>It follows a $725 million package announced Monday that included a
second tranche of landmines as well as anti-air and anti-armor
weapons. </p>
<p>The outgoing U.S. administration is working to get as much aid as
possible to Ukraine before Trump — who has repeatedly criticized U.S.
assistance for Kyiv and claimed he could secure a ceasefire within hours
— takes over. </p>
<p>Trump’s comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the
future of U.S. aid, and Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian attacks
in the absence of further American support. </p>
<p>The United States has spearheaded the push for international support
for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia
launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and coordinating aid from
dozens of countries. </p>
<p>Ukraine’s international supporters have since then provided tens of
billions of dollars in weapons, ammunition, training and other security
aid that has been key to helping Kyiv resist Russian forces. </p>
<p>The Biden administration still has about $6 billion of
congressionally granted presidential drawdown authority, including funds
authorized in 2024 and funds discovered by the Pentagon after
overestimating the value of arms shipped to Ukraine. </p>
<p>Since the Russian invasion in February 2022 the U.S. has committed
more than $62 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine. </p>

id="net-is-tightening-on-man-suspected-of-shooting-executive-says-official">‘Net
is tightening’ on man suspected of shooting executive, says
official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York’s mayor said Saturday “the net is tightening” on
the man suspected of gunning down a top health insurance executive
before fleeing the city. </p>
<p>Mayor Eric Adams said detectives knew the name of the fresh-faced
suspect, an image of whom was released by investigators Thursday and who
has now been on the run for almost four days. </p>
<p>Adams praised “the manner in which (investigators) were able to
follow his footsteps to recover evidence — some of it is known, some of
it is unknown — but the net is tightening and we’re going to bring this
person to justice,” he said, the New York Post reported. </p>
<p>Adams was quoted by the Post as saying the police were withholding
the suspect’s name for now. </p>
<p>“We don’t want to release that,” the mayor said. “If you do, you are
basically giving a tip to the person we are seeking, and we do not want
to give him an upper hand at all. Let him continue to believe he can
hide behind the mask.” </p>
<p>“We revealed his face,” the mayor continued, referring to numerous
security camera photos and video released after Brian Thompson, CEO of
UnitedHealthcare was gunned down. And eventually, “we’re going to reveal
who he is and we’re going to bring him to justice,” Adams said. </p>
<p>The masked assailant was caught on camera entering a bus station in a
northern neighborhood of Manhattan in the wake of Wednesday’s slaying,
but he could not be identified exiting the facility on foot, a police
spokesperson confirmed to Agence France-Presse. </p>
<p>“They believe he’s not in New York City,” the spokesperson
added. </p>
<p>The image of the smiling suspect was obtained from a youth hostel
where the gunman apparently stayed before the hit, detectives said, with
media reporting he lowered his mask to flirt with a receptionist. </p>
<p>The FBI, which said it was assisting the New York police, offered a
reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his capture. </p>
<p>‘Delay’ and ‘deny’ </p>
<p>The gunman on Wednesday sprayed Thompson of United Healthcare — one
of the country’s largest medical insurers — with bullets in front of
bystanders, in an audacious attack captured by a surveillance camera and
now seen by millions. </p>
<p>Thompson was attending an investor conference in the Midtown business
district. </p>
<p>Police have yet to suggest a motive and would not confirm media
reports that the words “delay” and “deny” — often used by insurance
companies to reject claims — were written on shell casings found at the
scene. </p>
<p>Video footage shows Thompson on the sidewalk outside the New York
Hilton Midtown when a man in a hooded top, his lower face covered,
approaches from behind, then fires several shots at his 50-year-old
victim, who crumples to the ground. </p>
<p>Camera footage showed the suspect fleeing on foot, before getting on
a bicycle, with police revealing he headed to Central Park. </p>
<p>Officers have confirmed that a cell phone as well as DNA from a
coffee cup were recovered from near the murder scene. </p>
<p>In the absence of an arrest, speculation has been rife that the
gunman may have sought revenge for adverse medical coverage decisions
made by the insurer. </p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare is a major player in the lucrative American health
care market; the parent group had revenues of $100.8 billion in the
third quarter of the year.</p>

id="macron-welcomes-trump-to-paris-with-presidential-pomp-joined-by-zelenskyy">Macron
welcomes Trump to Paris with presidential pomp, joined by Zelenskyy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Donald Trump to
Paris on Saturday with a full dose of presidential pomp as the two held
a hastily arranged meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy before
celebrating the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</p>
<p>On a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global
problems, the once and future American president was warmly embraced by
Macron upon arriving at the Elysee Palace.</p>
<p>“It’s a great honor for French people to welcome you five years
later,” Macron told Trump. “Welcome back again.”</p>
<p>Trump said it was a “very great honor” to be there, while hinting at
challenges ahead.</p>
<p>“It certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now.
And we’ll be talking about that,” Trump said.</p>
<p>An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the
kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American
presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican
Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump
doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European
leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as
America’s representative on the world stage.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame
ceremony, five years after a devastating fire, with the White House
citing a scheduling conflict. First lady Jill Biden was the official
U.S. representative in his place.</p>
<p>Macron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the
president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against
Russia’s invasion. Macron’s office said the war, along with conflicts in
the Mideast, would be discussed.</p>
<p>As Trump arrived at the official residence of the French president,
Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, offering
handshakes and plenty of back-patting for the cameras.</p>
<p>In a video posted later on X, Macron could be heard asking Trump:
“You remember?” as both men entered a reception room.</p>
<p>“I remember,” Trump answered.</p>
<p>Trump spent about 90 minutes inside, meeting first with Macron before
they were joined by Zelenskyy for about 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Macron had long planned to meet separately with Zelenskyy. The French
president’s office said the three-way talks were proposed by Macron and
arranged shortly before Trump’s arrival. Trump has pledged to end the
war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in
Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.</p>
<p>A person familiar with Trump’s plans had said before the meeting was
announced that while Trump and Zelenskyy were attending the cathedral
ceremony and surrounding events and probably would interact, Trump’s
transition team had not worked with the Ukrainians to schedule formal
talks.</p>
<p>After the place meeting, a Trump senior transition official did not
push back on the idea that it had come together at the last minute, but
said it had been “discussed fully and agreed to” and that Trump had been
“fully briefed” ahead of time.</p>
<p>The three leaders spoke in English, and translator was in the room,
according to a French official.</p>
<p>Accompanying Trump to Paris was a small contingent of advisers that
included incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with Steve Witkoff,
a longtime friend and real estate investor whom Trump has tapped as his
special envoy to the Middle East, and Massad Boulos, who is the
father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and will serve as senior
adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. </p>
<p>The group did not appear to include anyone with expertise on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“United States, Ukraine and France. Together on this historic day.
United for Notre-Dame. Let’s continue to work together for peace and
security,” Macron wrote on X afterward.</p>
<p>Trump’s victory last month threw into doubt the Biden
administration’s flow of money and arms to Ukraine — aid bolstered even
more on Saturday by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s announcement
of a $988 million package that brings American military support to more
than $62 billion since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.</p>
<p>Trump has characterized Zelenskyy as “the greatest salesman on Earth”
for winning billions in U.S. aid. Trump also has said he work out a
peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within a day of taking office and
has promoted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>In an effort to build trust with the incoming U.S. administration,
Zelenskyy’s top aide Andriy Yermak met key members of Trump’s team on a
two-day trip to the U.S. earlier this week.</p>
<p>Macron has argued that Ukraine’s defeat or a cease-fire with Russia
on unfavorable terms to Ukraine would be viewed as a loss for the U.S.
and even Trump himself, according to two European officials familiar
with the matter.</p>
<p>After arriving at Notre Dame for the ceremony, Trump was greeted by
Macron and his wife, Brigitte. He was given prime seating at the service
right between them — a better location than Jill Biden, who sat on
Brigitte Macron’s other side — and many current heads of government and
state. </p>
<p>Inside, Trump also greeted Zelenskyy as well as Britain’s Prince
William, who Trump met with later at the British ambassador’s residence
in Paris. Trump was greeted in the foyer, shook the royal’s hand and
said “good man, this one.”</p>
<p>Trump told reporters the Prince of Wales was doing “a fantastic job”
before the two went to sit down and talk in a private room reserved for
high-profile figures in the residence that once was the Paris town home
of Princess Pauline Borghese, the youngest sister French Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
<p>Prince William was also scheduled to meet separately with Jill Biden,
according to the British royal palace.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and X who has spent
considerable time with Trump since the election and spent millions to
elect him, was also in attendance at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made
a point of cultivating their bond since the Republican defeated Democrat
Kamala Harris. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the
significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in
office had been invited as well.</p>
<p>Trump was invited as president-elect of a “friendly nation,” Macron’s
office said, adding, “This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it
before.” </p>
<p>Trump is known to revel in pomp and circumstance. One of his first
trips as president his first term was to Paris, where Macron made him
the the guest of honor at Bastille Day events. Trump later said he
wanted to replicate the grand military parade back in the United
States.</p>
<p>Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump’s first term began
warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.</p>
<p>Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner, and
Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered
after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and
raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual defense
pact.</p>
<p>During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump often mocked Macron,
imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and
champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American
companies.</p>
<p>But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump
last month after the election.</p>
<p>When he accepted the invitation to travel to Paris, Trump said Macron
had done “a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to
its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day
for all!” Trump was president in 2019, when a fire nearly destroyed the
861-year-old landmark.</p>

id="trump-says-that-us-should-not-get-involved-in-conflict-in-syria">Trump
says that US should ‘not get involved’ in conflict in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday the U.S.
should not be involved in the conflict in Syria, where rebel forces are
threatening the government of President Bashar Assad.</p>
<p>“Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY
OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!,” Trump said in a post on his social media
platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump said because Russia, an Assad ally, is tied up fighting a war
with Ukraine, it “seems incapable of stopping this literal march through
Syria, a country they have protected for years.”</p>
<p>If Russia were forced out of Syria, it “may actually be the best
thing that can happen to them” because “there was never much of a
benefit in Syria for Russia,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments appeared to reflect his opposition to the presence
of some 900 U.S. troops in Syria, mostly of them in the northeast, where
they have backed a Syrian Kurd-led alliance in preventing a resurgence
of Islamic State militants.</p>
<p>Trump announced in 2018 during his first term that he wanted to
withdraw the U.S. troops because he said Islamic State was near
defeat.</p>
<p>But he held off as advisers warned that a pullout would leave a void
that would be filled by Iran and Russia.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor “changed the future of the world,” U.S. President Joe
Biden said at a White House event for veterans and their families on
Friday, the eve of the anniversary of Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl
Harbor.</p>
<p>The president recalled that he “heard so much” about Pearl Harbor
when he was growing up and talked about his uncles who enlisted in the
military after the attack.</p>
<p>“During World War II, we stood at an inflection point,” the president
said.  “We still stand at an inflection point. The decisions we make now
in the next four to five years will determine the course of our future
for decades to come. … We owe it to the next generation to set that
course on a more free, more secure and more just path.”</p>
<p>Saturday, December 7, marks the 83rd anniversary of Japan’s surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor, a U.S. naval base on the island of Oahu, Hawaii,
near Honolulu.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Japanese fighter planes unleashed bombs, bullets and
aerial torpedoes on America’s Pacific Fleet in the Sunday morning
attack.</p>
<p>More than 2,400 U.S. sailors, soldiers and civilians were killed that
day. About half of them died on the USS Arizona battleship.</p>
<p>The Japanese succeeded in sinking four of the eight U.S. battleships
at Pearl Harbor and damaging the remaining four.</p>
<p>According to the Naval History and History Command website, “That
more Japanese aircraft were not shot down had nothing to do with the
skill, training or bravery of our Sailors and other servicemembers.</p>
<p>“Rather, U.S. antiaircraft weapons were inadequate in number and
capability, for not only had the Japanese achieved tactical surprise,
they achieved technological surprise with aircraft and weapons far
better than anticipated — a lesson in the danger of underestimating the
enemy that resonates to this day.”</p>
<p>The day after the attack, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt appeared
before a joint session of Congress, seeking a declaration of war. After
he delivered his famous “Day of Infamy” speech, the Senate unanimously
supported the declaration. In the House, there was one dissenter,
Montana’s Representative Jeanette Rankin, a pacifist.</p>
<p>Roosevelt signed the declaration Monday afternoon. The United States
had now been officially drawn into World War II.</p>
<p>Before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had
imposed economic sanctions on Japan as a way of stopping Japan’s
expansion goals in Asia. The sanctions affected Japan’s access to
aircraft exports.</p>
<p>The attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor was part of
Japan’s plan to prevent any challenges to those goals in Asia.</p>
<p>There is now a USS Arizona Memorial that expands over the hull of the
sunken vessel without touching it.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a 104-year-old survivor of Pearl Harbor returned
to Hawaii to participate in this year’s commemorations. Ira “Ike” Schab
Jr. of Portland, Oregon, who was a Navy musician, was greeted at the
airport in Honolulu with a water cannon salute and music from the U.S.
Pacific Fleet Band.</p>
<p>When asked what he remembers about that day, Schab told the Hawaii
News Now website, “Being scared, more than anything else.” Schab said he
made the trip because he is one of the Pacific Fleet’s “very few”
survivors remaining from that day.</p>
<p>He said, “They deserve to be recognized and honored.”</p>

id="maternal-mortality-review-panels-are-in-the-spotlight.-heres-what-they-do">Maternal
mortality review panels are in the spotlight. Here’s what they do</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Efforts to reduce the nation’s persistently high maternal mortality
rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from
each mother’s death.</p>
<p>The panels — called maternal mortality review committees — usually do
their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that’s not been the
case recently in three states with strict abortion laws.</p>
<p>Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after
information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization
ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas’
committee won’t review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years
after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its
panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year.</p>
<p>“They’ve become more of a lightning rod than they were before,” said
epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health
and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia.</p>
<p>Here’s what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do
and what might happen next:</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>“Maternal mortality review committees are important because they are
the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality
that we have,” said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality
prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</p>
<p>The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year
after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes
of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses
to traffic accidents.</p>
<p>The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help “decide
what we can do about them.”</p>
<p>All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their
membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine
doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members
of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas
of expertise, which the CDC recommends.</p>
<p>How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit
letters of interest or be invited to serve.</p>
<p>The selection shouldn’t be politically motivated, Kramer said,
because “if there’s a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain
perspectives” it’s difficult to truly understand what’s happening.</p>
<p>How do they look at deaths?</p>
<p>First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and
epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by
examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a
related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and
fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media
reports and obituaries.</p>
<p>Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as
possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service
records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members.
Professional “abstractors” distill all this into case narratives, which
committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process
developed by the CDC — and all panels can get help and guidance from the
agency.</p>
<p>They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related?
What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors
contributed?</p>
<p>States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members
and people who provide information on the deaths.</p>
<p>The groups then issue public reports that don’t name moms or
hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some
come out a couple of years or more after the deaths.</p>
<p>Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from
those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical
professionals and policymakers.</p>
<p>What about Georgia, Texas and Idaho?</p>
<p>Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process,
the state public health commissioner said.</p>
<p>Texas’ committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on
2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health
Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>“Reviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for
more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will
allow us to provide that in the next report,” Anton said, adding that
maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and
publish data for 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the
state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state’s
health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said
Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the
first time in November and plan to issue a report by Jan. 31. Because
the legislature wanted the most up-to-date information, McLaughlin said
the first report will cover only 2023 cases, and the group will review
2022 deaths next.</p>
<p>Goodman said he’s encouraged that every state has a review committee
now — only 20 had them in 2015.</p>

id="irish-youtuber-moves-millions-of-followers-to-donate-millions-for-charity">Irish
YouTuber moves millions of followers to donate millions for charity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sean McLoughlin wears a lot of hats: YouTuber. Voice
actor. Coffee entrepreneur. But McLoughlin, better known by his
pseudonym Jacksepticeye, likes to say he would be a therapist if he
wasn’t posting video game playthroughs for his nearly 31 million
subscribers. </p>
<p>The 34-year-old Irish creator finds that gaming enthusiasts aren’t
just drawn by his expressive reactions to the latest action role-playing
games; fans also resonate with his candid discussions of mental health.
The supportive responses from his niche but passionate following make
McLoughlin feel “less alone,” he said, forging the same camaraderie that
brought him to online gaming communities as a lonely 20-something living
at his family’s remote home. </p>
<p>That shared connection is also central to his annual fundraiser,
“Thankmas.” The charity livestream is one of many online specials
emerging as a modern spin on the classic telethon. Total donations have
increased more than 50% over the last year on Tiltify, a digital
platform that integrates giving tools into streams. The spaces are
credited for allowing more authentic interactions between nonprofits and
young donors — and encouraging benevolence in a corner of the web marked
by incendiary rhetoric. </p>
<p>“If you want to do good things, the people are there, and they’ll
listen,” McLoughlin said. “They’re already following you for what you do
for a reason. So they’ll follow you to help out people as well.” </p>
<p>Follow they have. His streams have raked in more than $26 million,
according to partner Tiltify. This year’s goal is to collect $6 million
for two nonprofits supporting mental health: Crisis Text Line and
Samaritans. </p>
<p>A seven-figure target would have seemed a longshot when McLoughlin
entered the space. The initial idea was to hold monthly fundraisers. He
hosted seven charitable streams in 2018, Tiltify records show, for
causes including pediatric cancer and clean water. The year culminated
in the inaugural “Thankmas,” which pulled over a quarter of a million
dollars. </p>
<p>But McLoughlin said the pace became “a bit much.” That same year he
announced a brief break from YouTube, in part due to unhappiness from
the demands he felt for high content volumes. He resolved to focus on
one big holiday event at the end of the year, when he said people are “a
bit more giving and heartfelt.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2020 that Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman said the two
began working closely to maximize the streams’ reach. McLoughlin reached
out, according to Wasserman, and said he wanted something “more
impactful.” With communities worldwide reeling from the pandemic, they
put together the #HopeFromHome campaign: a peer-to-peer event where
multitudes could simultaneously rally around the same cause. McLoughlin
served as a tent pole supporting the other streamers. </p>
<p>Their first effort together yielded $1.9 million for United Way
Worldwide and more than one-third came from McLoughlin’s stream alone.
The following “Thankmas” generated more than $4.7 million. Wasserman
said he’d never seen his technology used so collaboratively. </p>
<p>“That’s what really made this a regular, multimillion-dollar event,”
Wasserman said. “Not just making it, ‘Hey I’m going to fundraise and
just watch me,’ but, ‘We as a community can do this and get involved
together.’” </p>
<p>Specials feature calls, celebrities</p>
<p>This year’s “Thankmas” will be performed before a live audience in
Los Angeles but broadcast online. Recent specials have seen McLoughlin
make surprise calls into streams that are also pooling contributions.
Comedic segments sometimes feature traditional celebrities; actor Jack
Black played a life-sized game of Jenga in 2022. </p>
<p>The idea resembles the star-studded telethon pioneered last century
by comedian Jerry Lewis. But new technologies and web cultures enable
more engaging experiences. Wasserman said charitable livestreams like
McLoughlin’s are not a “passive watching experience.” </p>
<p>It’s “a much more personable approach to giving,” according to Yvette
Wohn, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies
human-computer interaction. </p>
<p>A streamer’s audience “cares about them,” Wohn said, and donors flock
to their content because “they really like that person.” Social media
and chat boxes allow fans to feel seen by hosts in ways television
viewers could never expect. Followers might get shoutouts by name upon
contributing. McLoughlin has previously shared fan art submitted through
specific hashtags. </p>
<p>Fandoms also develop subcultures. McLoughlin’s gaming catchphrases
are especially popular among his circles. Jacksepticeye content often
starts with him shouting, “Top of the morning to ya, laddies!” and fans
have uploaded video compilations of the expression. Members then form
friendships with others in the fandom. That creates a “positive social
pressure” to donate, according to Wohn, helping new generations “dip
their toes into building an identity as somebody that gives.” </p>
<p>“Giving habits are things that build over time,” Wohn said. “If
younger people start to engage in this culture of giving, I feel like
the general culture of giving might expand in ways that cannot be done
from a top-down perspective.” </p>
<p>Online communities offer kinship</p>
<p>Still, McLoughlin describes online communities as a “double-edged
sword.” The “monetization of hate,” he said, is “bigger than it’s ever
been.” And the desire for acceptance can introduce lonely people to dark
pockets of the internet that nevertheless provide kinship. </p>
<p>“Thankmas” aims to prove it’s easy to do good online. Yes, he
acknowledged, charity work is “quite intimidating.” Where is the line
between promoting the fundraiser and promoting himself? McLoughlin
doesn’t know. He just hopes people trust it’s coming from the right
place. </p>
<p>At least one longtime follower was drawn by McLoughlin’s ties to this
year’s cause. Jack Worthey, a 20-year-old from Texas, said McLoughlin
brought much comfort growing up with “similar family troubles.” It had
been several years since he watched Jacksepticeye content, he said, but
he was pulled back by an October video where McLoughlin detailed his
journey finding mental health treatment. </p>
<p>Worthey said he wouldn’t have looked into “Thankmas” had McLoughlin
had not made the promotion so personal. He now plans to raise awareness
through digital art. For Worthey, returning to the channel as an adult
and seeing the “positive product” has been “really amazing.” </p>
<p>“It makes you see what I was enjoying when I was younger in a
different light,” Worthey said. “It brings a different type of joy.”</p>

<h2 id="appeals-court-upholds-law-that-could-ban-tiktok-in-us">Appeals
court upholds law that could ban TikTok in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday upheld a law
requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be sold to a
non-Chinese owner or face closure in the United States by next month.
The court cited “persuasive” and “compelling” arguments presented by the
federal government that TikTok poses a risk to national security.</p>
<p>The ruling could leave the 170 million Americans who regularly use
TikTok without access to a social media platform that has enjoyed
explosive global growth in recent years. It could also mean that the
millions of Americans who create content for TikTok — some of whom rely
on monetizing that content for their livelihood — could be cut off from
their audiences.</p>
<p>The government has argued that TikTok presents a unique danger to
national security because it collects vast amounts of information about
its users, and because the Chinese government ultimately exercises
control over its parent company, ByteDance, and over the algorithm that
determines what content TikTok users see.</p>
<p>Because ByteDance is in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) it is
subject to that country’s laws, including measures requiring private
companies to cooperate with government intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit found that the government has a compelling interest
in taking steps “to counter the PRC’s efforts to collect great
quantities of data about tens of millions of Americans” and “to limit
the PRC’s ability to manipulate content covertly on the TikTok
platform.”</p>
<p>TikTok signals an appeal</p>
<p>TikTok immediately signaled that it would appeal the circuit court’s
ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to its website, the company said, “The Supreme
Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans’
right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this
important constitutional issue.”</p>
<p>The company said that the law underlying the case “was conceived and
pushed through based on inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information,
resulting in outright censorship of the American people,” and warned
that it “will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in
the U.S. and around the world.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is not obligated to hear the company’s appeal, and
it was not immediately clear that it would do so. If the high court
accepts the case, it is possible that it would block the government from
enforcing the law until the case is decided.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a TikTok ban before
changing his mind during the recent presidential election, has suggested
that he will act to save the app when he takes office. However, it is
unclear what options he might have for doing that.</p>
<p>Lack of trust</p>
<p>In April, President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from
Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act into law. The measure gave
TikTok 270 days to find a way to separate itself from ByteDance before a
ban on the application would kick in on January 19, 2025.</p>
<p>The federal government made it clear that the only kind of
divestiture that it would accept was a complete separation of TikTok
from its Chinese parent. The company offered alternatives, and
established TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc. (TTUSDS) as a subsidiary in
Delaware, to wall off U.S. user data from ByteDance.</p>
<p>However, the government cited instances in which U.S. user data that
the company claimed to have shielded from the PRC was, in fact,
accessible to ByteDance employees in mainland China. It told the court
that it lacked “the requisite trust” that “ByteDance and TTUSDS would
comply in good faith” with any arrangement other than complete
separation of TikTok and ByteDance.</p>
<p>In Friday’s ruling, the judges wrote, “The court can neither fault
nor second-guess the government on these crucial points.”</p>
<p>First Amendment concerns</p>
<p>TikTok and its supporters have claimed that severing TikTok from
ByteDance is both practically impossible for technological reasons and
legally impossible because the Chinese government will block the sale of
the company. Therefore, they claim, the law constitutes a de facto ban
and a violation of the guarantee of free speech enshrined in the First
Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>In a sign of how seriously the court took the First Amendment
arguments, the panel of judges agreed that the law should be subject to
“heightened scrutiny,” which the Supreme Court has applied to measures
restricting fundamental rights.</p>
<p>In the end, the panel determined that the law satisfies even the most
stringent form of “strict scrutiny,” which requires that the government
“prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is
narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.”</p>
<p>Free speech advocates respond</p>
<p>The decision came under immediate criticism from free speech
advocates.</p>
<p>“Although we’re still analyzing the decision, we find it deeply
disappointing,” David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, said in a statement emailed to VOA. “The court
appropriately applied strict scrutiny as we have urged it to. But the
strict-scrutiny analysis is lacking, relying heavily on speculation
about possible future harms.</p>
<p>“Restricting the free flow of information, even from foreign
adversaries, is fundamentally undemocratic,” Greene said. “Until now,
the U.S. has championed the free flow of information and called out
other nations when they have shut down internet access or banned online
communications tools like social media apps.”</p>
<p>George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute
at Columbia University, told VOA that the court accorded “a shocking
amount of deference” to the government’s claims about the danger TikTok
poses to national security.</p>
<p>“We should be really wary whenever we allow the government to use
vague national security arguments as a justification to shut down
speech,” Wang said. “That’s a tactic of authoritarian regimes, not
democracies. It’s usually the job of courts to stand up to the
government when it infringes on the constitutional rights of millions of
Americans, and I think the D.C. Circuit really didn’t do that
today.”</p>
<p>‘A victory for the American people’</p>
<p>Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the senior Democrat on the House
Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States
and the Chinese Communist Party, and one of the original sponsors of the
law requiring TikTok’s divestiture or ban, released a statement Friday
praising the court’s decision.</p>
<p>“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached
the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist
Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat
that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,”
Krishnamoorthi said.</p>
<p>“Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s
control is a day that our security is at risk,” Krishnamoorthi
added.</p>
<p>Representative John Moolenaar, the committee’s Republican chairman,
said in a statement that the ruling was “a victory for the American
people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party,
which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance’s control over TikTok
to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens and threaten our
national security.”</p>
<p>Moolenaar also held out hope to the app’s users that access to it
may, in the end, be preserved under a Trump presidency.</p>
<p>“I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American
takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I
look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,”
Moolenaar said.</p>

market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: Market Place</p>
<p>
It’s been a wonky year for the labor market. Unemployment is down and
inflation has eased. But ask an average American, and they might not
feel like everything is peachy keen. In this episode, we asked
economists to sum up the complicated year … in a song. Plus,
homebuilders worry incoming President Donald Trump’s immigration policy
will leave them short-handed, and retail hiring plateaued in November —
unusual for the holiday shopping season.

police officer denies leaking information to Proud Boys leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A retired Washington, D.C., police officer charged with
lying about his private communications with former Proud Boys national
leader Enrique Tarrio testified Friday that he never leaked sensitive
police information to the far-right extremist group leader. </p>
<p>Taking the witness stand at his federal trial, former Metropolitan
Police Department Lieutenant Shane Lamond said he was upset that a
prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys “sympathizer” who acted as a
“double agent” for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives
Matter banner in December 2020. </p>
<p>“I don’t support the Proud Boys, and I’m not a Proud Boys
sympathizer,” said Lamond, whose bench trial started Monday and
continues next week. </p>
<p>Tarrio, who testified Thursday as a witness for Lamond’s defense, is
serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in a plot to use force to
keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election. Tarrio
previously was sentenced to more than five months in jail for burning
the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington
and for bringing two high-capacity firearm magazines into the
district. </p>
<p>Lamond said Tarrio never confessed to him that he burned the banner.
He also denies tipping off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been
signed before he arrived in Washington on January 4, 2021 — two days
before other Proud Boys joined a mob’s attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p>
<p>Lamond’s indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the
January 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger
of being charged in the attack. </p>
<p>“Of course I can’t say it officially, but personally I support you
all and don’t want to see your group’s name and reputation dragged
through the mud,” Lamond wrote. </p>
<p>Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he
said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain
his trust. </p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to other
messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with “real-time updates” on
the police investigation of the December 12, 2020, banner burning. </p>
<p>Lamond is charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three
counts of making false statements. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman
Jackson will decide the case after hearing testimony without a
jury. </p>
<p>Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence
branch of the police department’s Homeland Security Bureau. He was
responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to
Washington. </p>
<p>The men exchanged hundreds of messages across several platforms, with
Lamond frequently greeting Tarrio as “brother.” However, Lamond
acknowledged that he only sent encrypted messages to Tarrio or met him
in person after the banner burning.  </p>
<p>On the day of his arrest, Tarrio posted a message to other Proud Boys
leaders that said, “The warrant was just signed.” Tarrio testified
Thursday that he didn’t confess to Lamond or receive any confidential
information from him. </p>
<p>After the banner burning but before Tarrio’s arrest, Lamond told him
that the FBI and U.S. Secret Service was “all spun up” by chatter that
Proud Boys planned to dress up as supporters of President Joe Biden for
the Democrat’s inauguration in January 2021. </p>
<p>“I’m just going to let them get all freaked out. They’re idiots,”
Lamond wrote of his federal colleagues. </p>
<p>“Lol,” Tarrio responded. </p>
<p>Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, retired in May 2023 after 23
years of service to the police department.</p>
