      <p>Heckler shouts ‘end the deportations’ as Mississippi congressman Bennie Thompson says, under Noem’s direction, DHS has ‘detained Americans’</p>
<p><strong>Chris Van Hollen</strong>, the Democratic senator from Maryland, was among the lawmakers speaking out against <strong>the Trump administration</strong> and its actions around <strong>Venezuela</strong>, taking to the senate floor on Wednesday to call on Congress to block Donald Trump from “using taxpayer dollars to launch a <strong>regime change war</strong>” <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>“Last time I checked, the <strong>constitution</strong> of the United States gives <strong>Congress</strong> – this body – the power to decide questions of war or peace,” he said.</p>

      <h1>US lawmakers condemn seizure of Venezuelan oil tanker: ‘Trump is sleepwalking us into a war’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)

      <p>Unease grows in Washington, including among some Republicans, over Trump administration’s escalating military posture in the Caribbean</p>

</ul>
<p>Senior Democratic lawmakers and at least one Republican have condemned Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker</a> off the nation’s coast, with one saying Donald Trump is “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.</p>
<p>There is growing, at least somewhat bipartisan unease in Washington over the administration’s escalating military posture in the region. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.</p>

      <h1>‘Censorship pure and simple’: critics hit out at Trump plan to vet visitors’ social media</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>Some warn proposal will decimate US tourism industry as free speech advocates say it will lead to people self-censoring</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have accused Donald Trump of “shredding civil liberties” and “censorship pure and simple” after the White House said it planned to require visa applicants from dozens of countries to provide social media, phone and email histories for vetting before being allowed into the US.</p>
<p>In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve decided to cut interest rates again at its meeting this week, partly because Fed officials think the labor market is weaker than it appears. This morning, we'll hear why Fed Chair Jerome Powell says estimating job growth can be so tricky. Also on the show, we'll dig into the drone warfare industry, central to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Plus, are we past tariff inflation yet?</p>

<p>He excelled at <em>two</em> colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/25/shedeur-sanderss-first-round-nfl-draft">dramatic stock crashes</a> in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>US forces have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong> <strong>, in all this?</strong> The Nobel peace prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway">greeted crowds in Oslo</a> after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.</p>
<p><strong>Do we know who sent the letters?</strong> It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Mexico’s parliament has voted in favor of a bill imposing tariffs of between 5% and 50% on more than 1,400 products from Asian nations, including China. Mexico states that the aim is to boost jobs and domestic production. Then, survivors of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim in Britain against the oil and gas giant Shell. And later, we'll hear about the lucrative business of making drones and developing the technology to thwart them.</p>

Longtime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesotans</a> said they had never seen the mall as quiet as it has been in recent days, almost jarringly still.</p>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The AI boom is propelling a once-obscure group of state regulators into key decision-making roles for the economy. AI needs data centers, data centers need power and power is generally regulated in some way — depending on the state — by public utilities commissions.</p>
<p>That's the topic of a new report from the Center on Technology Policy at NYU. Scott Brennen, CTP director and author of the report, said these commissions often make decisions on planning and permitting for new infrastructure and decide the rates utilities charge consumers.</p>

<p>The 3,000-page bill also includes a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/military-strikes-boats-drugs-caribbean-hegseth-congress-93c513e28f38688f5582150c7675c072">demand</a> for more information about nearly two dozen lethal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/visual-guide-us-military-presence-caribbean">boat strikes</a> in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug smugglers.

      <p>
      <p>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May</p>
<p>The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.</p>
<p>The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe">White House national security strategy</a> that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.</p>

      <h1>Fed rate cut diverges from global central bank strategy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter point. That’s pretty much what analysts expected. But in other parts of the world, central banks have been signaling that they plan to hold rates steady or even hike them. In this global economy, why is the U.S. out of step? Also in this episode, we hear the pros and cons of quarterly earnings reports, check in on a union-run pipefitting apprenticeship and dig into why wage growth has slowed.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/01/stockton-california-shooting-suspect">investigators parse through</a> the aftermath of the shooting, they have found at least 50 shell casings and believe at least five firearms were used in the attack, San Joaquin sheriff Patrick Withrow told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/montana-climate-trial-young-activists-judge-order">groundbreaking legal decision in August 2023</a>, a Montana judge ruled in favor of 16 youth plaintiffs who had accused state officials of violating their constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings in late 2024. But state lawmakers have since violated her ruling, enshrining new laws this year that contradict it, argue 13 of the 16 plaintiffs in a petition filed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>TheFifa prize’s existence was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">announced</a> remarkably soon after the Nobel went to Venezuelan opposition leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-corina-machado">María Corina Machado</a>. Gianni Infantino, the controversial Fifa president, has been toadying to Trump for years, so after he introduced the prize – in response to zero demand – it was little surprise that Trump got the trophy.</p>

      <p>Car company said team detected ‘unusual activity’ inside vehicle and called to check on rider and alert 911</p>
<p>Self-driving Waymo taxis have gone viral for negative reasons including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/san-francisco-waymo-kitkat-cat-death">death of a beloved San Francisco bodega cat</a> and pulling an illegal U-turn in front of police, who were unable to issue a ticket to a nonexistent driver.</p>
<p>But this week, the company behind the self-driving taxis is drawing attention to the happier news that a San Francisco woman gave birth in a Waymo.</p>

<p>The Indianapolis Colts have not ruled out starting Philip Rivers at quarterback after luring the grandfather out of retirement amid an injury crisis.</p>
<p>The Colts lost starter Daniel Jones for the season after he tore his achilles on Sunday, while their first-round pick in 2023, Anthony Richardson, is out with a broken orbital bone he suffered in October. With backup Riley Leonard dealing with a knee injury, the Colts turned to the 44-year-old Rivers, who retired at the end of the 2020 season. Rivers, who has been a high school coach since his retirement and <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/philip-rivers-family-tree-kids-grandkid-wife-tiffany-alabama/eb5a2ed147d02cf23380c40d#Philip%20Rivers%20grandchildren">recently welcomed his first grandchild</a>, played for the Colts in his final season after a long stint with the Chargers.</p>

      <h1>Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter point amid apparent split over US economy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Divisive vote to lower rates highlights uncertainty in the Fed as economy absorbs major shakeups, including tariffs</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it was cutting interest rates by a quarter point for the third time this year, as the embattled central bank appeared split over how best to manage the US economy.</p>
<p>The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.</p>

      <h1>Keir’s performance in PMQs panto sets bar low enough for Kemi to stay as Tory leader | John Crace</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Lib Dems’ Gentleman Ed rips into Starmer for staying silent on The Donald’s US security strategy</p>
<p>With little more than a week to go until the Christmas recess, the Commons is in festive overdrive. Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose of PMQs at the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.</p>
<p>No one embraces the panto spirit more than Kemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.</p>

<p>In Washington, rain over the state’s watersheds and mountains are causing rising rivers that could imperil homes, livestock and lives in valleys from Mount Rainier to Mount Baker, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/wa-homeowners-fear-property-damage-from-floods-heres-what-to-know/">the Seattle Times</a> reported.

<p>Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni moved quickly on Wednesday to shut down the rising speculation around Jalen Hurts’ job security, calling talk of a potential quarterback change “ridiculous” despite his team’s three-game losing streak and their franchise star’s sudden dip in form.</p>
<p>Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl">Monday night’s 22-19 defeat</a> to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.</p>

<p><strong>European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.</strong></p>
<p>Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer <strong>Rheinmetall</strong> are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker <strong>BAE</strong> <strong>System</strong> has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.</p>
<p>Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.</p>
<p>Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.</p>

<p>A Democratic lawmaker from Michigan has introduced articles of impeachment against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy</a>, the US health secretary, accusing him of “abuse of authority and undermining of the public health”.</p>
<p>Representative Haley Stevens, who is currently <a href="https://haleyformi.com/">running for Senate</a>, formally introduced the articles on impeachment on Wednesday, several months after she announced that she <a href="https://stevens.house.gov/media/press-releases/michigan-congresswoman-haley-stevens-announces-she-will-introduce-articles">vowed</a> to file the articles.</p>

This presents an opportunity for bad actors to pitch homeowners something that might cost more than they’d think. Today, we discuss some &quot;too good to be true&quot; refinance opportunities.

      <h1>US health officials re-examine RSV shots despite documented safety and efficacy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>The FDA is reviewing RSV vaccines, which have drastically lowered infant hospitalizations, a spokesperson confirmed</p>
<p>US regulatory officials are re-examining the safety of RSV shots despite no published reports of safety issues – a move that could lead to the removal or limitation of shots that have dramatically lowered hospitalizations among babies.</p>
<p>It’s the latest move from US health officials under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, to limit access to shots and to undermine public trust in the safe and effective products.</p>

      <h1>Gen-Zine: DIY publications find new life as form of resistance against Trump</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Zines have made a resurgence as communities seek to share information on everything from ICE raids to local elections</p>
<p>On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.</p>

      <h1>Zelenskyy ‘ready for elections’ after Trump questions Ukrainian democracy | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy">ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months</a>, if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.</p>
<p><strong>Why hasn’t there been an election?</strong> Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he talk about?</strong> There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris lost last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">US presidential election</a> because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.</p>
<p>The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by <a href="https://rootsaction.org/">RootsAction</a>.</p>

      <h1>‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressure</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>In 2010 and 2022, the US faced heightened emotions from the lead-in to the tournament itself. As hosts next year, little will change</p>
<p>The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.</p>
<p>With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.</p>

      <p>The extended Black Friday sale season means a lot of people have been buying new TVs. The top sets today can display in up to 8K Ultra High Definition, they have deeper blacks, brighter highlights and are thinner and lighter-weight than ever. And yet, modern TVs have their haters — a dedicated group of purists who find them lacking, and would rather hunt down a good old fashioned used plasma.</p>

<p>US diplomats have been ordered to return to using the Times New Roman typeface in official communications, with secretary of state Marco Rubio calling the Biden administration’s decision to adopt Calibri a “wasteful” diversity move, according to an internal department cable seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The department under Rubio’s predecessor Antony Blinken switched to Calibri in 2023, claiming the modern sans-serif typeface was more accessible for people with disabilities because it did not have the decorative angular features and was the default in Microsoft products.</p>

<p>Frederick Green allegedly shot NFL player in abdomen</p>
</li>

<p>Boyd was on night out with Jets teammates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Bronx man has been charged with attempted murder in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/16/kris-boyd-new-york-jets-shot-nfl">the shooting of New York Jets player Kris Boyd</a>, police announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The New York police department said Frederick Green, 20, was charged late Monday night. Police had revealed Monday that a “person of interest” was in custody but didn’t name them. It was not immediately clear if Green has an attorney. He also faces additional charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.</p>
<p>Boyd was shot in the abdomen just after 2am on 16 November in midtown Manhattan. Boyd, his friend and two other Jets’ players, Irvin Charles and Jamien Sherwood, had left a club and were approached by a group of men who made fun of their clothing, police told reporters at a news briefing.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Claressa Shields will defend her undisputed heavyweight championship in Detroit on 22 February, returning home for a rematch with Franchon Crews-Dezurn in her first fight since signing a landmark $8m promotional deal. The bout will headline a Dazn card at Little Caesars Arena, the home of the NBA’s Pistons and NHL’s Red Wings where Shields attracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/27/claressa-shields-fight-heavyweight-title-detroit">a near-sellout crowd for her most recent fight</a> last July.</p>
<p>Shields (17-0, 3 KO) and Crews-Dezurn (10-2, 2 KO) first met nearly a decade ago when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/19/claressa-shields-boxing-olympics-professional-debut-kovalev-ward">made their professional debuts against each other</a> on the undercard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/20/andre-ward-sergey-kovalev-boxing-points-decision-title-fight">Andre Ward’s victory over Sergey Kovalev</a> in 2016. Shields won a four-round unanimous decision that night in Las Vegas, a moment she still sees as formative. “I had just come off winning two Olympic gold medals, fresh out of the amateurs, and finding an opponent was tough,” she said in a press release announcing the fight. “Franchon stepped in. I’ve grown a lot since that first victory, but me and Franchon have unfinished business that needs to be settled.”</p>

      <p>Former employees from justice department’s civil rights division accuse Trump administration of purging experts</p>
<p>More than 200 former employees in the justice department’s civil rights division <a href="https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Civil-Rights-Division-Sign-On-Letter.pdf">signed a letter</a> released on Tuesday decrying the “near destruction” of the agency that is supposed to enforce US civil rights laws and accused political leadership of waging a campaign to purge career experts from its ranks.</p>
<p>There was a mass exodus of lawyers earlier this year after political appointees removed career managers, detailed employees to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/civil-rights-division-doj-trump">menial work,</a> unilaterally dropped cases, and made it clear the division’s focus would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">enforcing</a> Donald Trump’s priorities. By 1 May of this year, the department had lost about 70% of its attorneys – a staggering number. The letter was released on Tuesday to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights division.</p>

      <h1>Lionel Messi named 2025 MLS MVP, the second player to win award twice</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>Inter Miami star scored 29 goals with 19 assists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Messi won MLS Cup MVP in South Florida on Saturday</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a season in which he led Inter Miami to the club’s first MLS Cup, Lionel Messi has been named the Landon Donovan MLS Most Valuable Player for the 2025 season. League commissioner Don Garber made the announcement on Tuesday, capping a season in which Messi scored 29 goals with 19 assists in 28 appearances, one short of Carlos Vela’s record for goal contributions in a single season (though Vela’s was done in 31 games).</p>
<p>Messi joins Kansas City Wizards legend Preki as the only players to win the MVP award twice, with Messi being the first to win two such awards consecutively. At 38, Messi is not the oldest MVP in MLS history – that distinction also goes to Preki, who was the oldest MVP in the history of North American professional sports when he won the award at age 40 in 2003.</p>

      <p>Walmart is moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq market. It's the biggest company ever to make the switch. Thing is, Nasdaq has a cool-kids, growth-through-tech kinda vibe and is home to Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia stocks. This morning, we'll help you understand what’s behind Walmart’s decision. Plus, consumers expect inflation to remain steady, and President Donald Trump looks to block state laws regulating AI.</p>

      <h1>New York City braces for new casinos as gambling surge in US worries experts</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>Three proposed casinos approved as researchers say they take money from businesses and increase addiction</p>
<p>New York City will probably soon see three new casinos, whose owners could rake in profits because of a recent surge in gambling in the United States that has some campaigners worried.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> gaming facility location board last week approved three proposed casinos in the US’s largest city – two in Queens and one in the Bronx – after determining the businesses would create new jobs and generate billions in tax revenue, according to the <a href="https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/12/12.01.25.gflbselectiondocument.pdf">group’s report</a>.</p>
<p>This article was amended on 9 December 2025 to correct that the New York gaming facility location board approved the casinos last week, not this week as previously stated.</p>

      <p>Civicus, a nonprofit that monitors global civic freedoms, moved the US from the ‘narrowed’ to ‘obstructed’ category. Plus, the ‘gay wool’ taking over a New York catwalk</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-civic-health-rating-trump">downgraded the civic health rating of the US</a> from “narrowed” to “obstructed”.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> <strong>does it mean by “obstructed”?</strong> Countries where civic space is heavily contested – where civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them, including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.</p>
<p><strong>What’s holding up</strong> <strong>the European plan?</strong> Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn ($213bn) of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.</p>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A new law comes into force in Australia today, banning children under 16 from some of their favorite social media platforms, including Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram. And as you'd expect, most teens aren’t happy about it, though many parents see it as the government standing up to American Big Tech. Also, Nvidia is now authorized to sell advanced AI chips to China, and President Donald Trump says the U.S. government will be taking a 25% cut of sales.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Prosthetic limbs can be expensive, costing thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the industry seemed ripe for disruption when 3D printing came along. The technology requires little labor and uses economical materials. But the reality of 3D printing prosthetic limbs isn’t that straightforward, according to writer and University of California, Berkeley, lecturer Britt Young, who uses a prosthetic arm.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Young about why 3D printing has yet to bring down prosthesis costs.</p>

<p>If Mark Carney's first nine months as prime minister have revealed a difference of opinion over how the federal government should go about fighting climate change, he now has to prove that his approach can put Canada on a credible path to net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

      <p>Agents who kneeled in 2020 accuse Kash Patel of retaliation and say they were trying to calm volatile situation</p>
<p>Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington have sued to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.</p>
<p>The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Kash Patel, the FBI director, because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with Donald Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on 4 June 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.</p>

      <p>President says farmers are ‘the backbone of our country’ and says China has committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans</p>
<p><a href="http://mpdc.dc.gov/release/statement-chief-police-pamela-smith">In a statement</a>, <strong>Pamela Smith</strong> said she was “deeply humbled, grateful and deeply appreciative” of her time in her role, which she described as the “greatest honor” of her career. She gave thanks to the mayor for appointing her in 2023 and supporting her throughout her tenure, which she acknowledged had been both “challenging and rewarding”.</p>
<p>Smith adds that “tremendous progress” has been made but the city is not at “zero percent crime” yet.</p>
<p><em>I am confident that the department is in a strong position and that the great work will continue, moving in a positive trajectory to combat crime and enhance public safety. Washington, DC is an extraordinary place to live, visit, and work, and I remain inspired by the resilience and spirit of this community.</em></p>
<p><em>I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity as Chief of Police. It has been an honor to lead the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department, and I will always carry with the me the pride of having served this city.</em></p>
<p><em>When Chief Smith stepped up to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, we had no time to waste. She came in at a very challenging time for our community, when there was significant urgency to reverse the crime trends our city was facing post pandemic. Within a year of her tenure, we opened the Real-Time Crime Center.</em></p>
<p><em>We deployed newer and better technology. We worked with the Council to pass comprehensive legislation that prioritizes accountability. And Chief Smith got all of this done while also navigating unprecedented challenges and attacks on our city’s autonomy.</em></p>

      <p>Paramount’s bid for the entire company counters $82.7bn Netflix deal for WBD’s studio and streaming operation</p>
<p>David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is not giving up in its aggressive campaign to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), launching a hostile bid for the entertainment company despite the announcement on Friday that Netflix had agreed to buy its studio and streaming operation.</p>
<p>Netflix’s bid for WBD’s storied Hollywood movie studio, as well as its premier HBO cable network, valued the company at $82.7bn. But it did not agree to acquire WBD’s traditional television assets, including the news network CNN and the Discovery channel.</p>

      <p>The two-term Texas congresswoman seeks to flip seat held by Republican John Cornyn in the GOP-dominated state</p>
<p>Democratic representative Jasmine Crockett launched a bid for US Senate in Texas on Monday, bringing a high-profile official to a race that may be critical to Democrats’ bold ambition to reclaim a Senate majority in next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>Crockett, one of Congress’s most outspoken Democrats and a frequent target of GOP attacks, made the announcement shortly before the state’s 6pm deadline for candidates to file the paperwork to run in the primary, due to be held on 3 March. The two-term representative of Dallas is seeking to flip the seat held by Republican John Cornyn, who is running for re-election in the GOP-dominated state.</p>

      <h1>Trump turns on Europe: will he pull support for Ukraine? | The Latest</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump has loomed large over Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s meeting with European leaders, after the US president took aim at the Ukrainian leader once again. It comes in the wake of a new White House national security strategy that has caused fear in Europe, but drawn praise from the Kremlin. Lucy Hough speaks to our Europe correspondent Jon Henley.</p>

<p>The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, stated repeatedly in 2016 on Fox News that US service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump – exactly the position he called “ <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5621756-pete-hegseth-democratic-lawmakers-influence-video/">despicable</a>” when Democratic lawmakers said it last month.</p>
<p>The debate about whether US soldiers should refuse illegal orders is now at the center of a fiery political dispute over the US killings of alleged drug traffickers in boats off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>

      <h1>‘We’ll need to see a warrant’: the group teaching businesses a vital tool to fight ICE raids</h1>

      <p>Siembra in North Carolina gives owners fourth amendment rights trainings should federal agents show up at their door</p>
<p>When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection agents descended on North Carolina last month, many local businesses were ready to push back. Posted on store- and restaurant-front windows across the state were signs reading: “private area”, “fourth amendment workplace” and “There’s always room at our table, but to enter past this point, we’ll need to see a warrant signed by a judge.”</p>
<p>The signs are part of a new fourth amendment strategy launched by the North Carolina immigrant rights group Siembra, to teach business owners their rights if federal agents show up at their door. While most Americans can name the rights protected by the first and second amendments, far fewer are familiar with the fourth, which prohibits unreasonable government searches and seizures. Siembra is working to change that, seeing the fourth amendment as a vital tool in fighting against the Trump administration’s brutal immigration crackdowns.</p>

<p>The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.</p>

      <h1>The once formidable Kansas City Chiefs look old, tired and out of ideas</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Patrick Mahomes has led his team to seven straight AFC Championship Games, winning three Super Bowls on the way. That run appears to be over</p>
<p>This is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.</p>
<p>For much of this season, there had been a gnawing sense of inevitability about the Chiefs. Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has been <em>slightly</em> better than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs. And in a one-off game, with everything on the line, it would still be hard to look past the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes axis.</p>

      <h1>Using AI chatbots for mental health support poses serious risks for teens, report finds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>A new report from Stanford and Common Sense Media finds that more than half of U.S. teens use AI chatbots for companionship. But, according to Dr. Darja Djordjevic, an adolescent and adult psychiatrist who co-authored the research, the bots aren't equipped to provide the kind of emotional support young people need when dealing with a mental health issue.</p>
<p>Dr. Djordjevic and her team simulated conversations involving various mental health concerns with four of the most popular consumer chatbots and identified several risks; chiefly, their tendency to be sycophantic. A note, this conversation mentions suicide and self-harm.</p>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Speaking at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night, Donald Trump said the Ukrainian president 'hasn’t yet read' the latest US-authored peace proposal for the war in Ukraine. Trump added: 'Russia is, I believe, fine with [the deal], but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it. His people love it but he hasn't read it.' The US president's comments come after days of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials ended on Saturday without an apparent breakthrough. Zelenskyy will be received in London by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, along with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the negotiations</p>

<p>The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.</p>
<p>“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”</p>

<p>Almost every couple that I know in their 20s, 30s or even 40s has had the same argument with their parents before getting married.</p>
<p>The parents say to open a wedding registry. The couple responds that they do not want one. They don’t expect gifts from wedding guests (their “presence is enough”), and they have been <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/FP/lamidi-cohab-prev-and-never-married-fp-15-21.pdf">cohabiting</a> for years and already have plates, bedsheets and a blender. In fact, since they live in a small rented apartment, they barely have room for the plates that they do have – let alone a set of china.</p>

      <h1>No, New York City’s wealthiest are not fleeing the city after Mamdani’s win</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>Conservatives warned of a mass exodus if the democratic socialist won, but experts, and property data, paint a very different picture</p>
<p>The warnings were stark. If Zohran Mamdani were to win the New York City mayoral election, his plans to raise taxes – slightly – on the city’s wealthiest residents would cause millionaires to bolt en masse, decamping to lower-tax states such as Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>The New York Post, a conservative tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, told readers on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&amp;oq=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTEwNjE0ajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">an almost daily basis</a> through October that New York would effectively become a ghost town under Mamdani’s mayoralty, a propaganda campaign that concluded the day before the election with the bombastic claim that <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/03/us-news/nearly-a-million-new-yorkers-ready-to-flee-nyc-if-mamdani-becomes-mayor-poll/">“nearly a million”</a> people were planning to “flee”.</p>

<p>Chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton speaks with Quebec Liberal MP Steven Guilbeault, who resigned from Prime Minister Mark Carney's cabinet last week, about his party’s deal with Alberta for a potential pipeline to the west coast of B.C., and why he thinks the federal government is stoking Quebec separatism by walking back its climate commitments.</p>

<p>From the moment Curt Cignetti took Indiana’s head coaching job, he made it clear this would be a different program. He refused to tolerate any moral victories or close calls and instead expected to win, to win big and win immediately.</p>
<p>In just 737 days, he turned what had been the Football Bowl Subdivision’s most losing program into the nation’s No 1 seed heading into the playoffs, a legitimate championship contender and a Big Ten champion for the first time since 1967. On Sunday, the inevitable was confirmed with Indiana <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/07/indiana-clinch-cfps-no-1-seed-as-alabama-and-miami-push-out-notre-dame">becoming the No 1 team</a> in The Associated Press Top 25 college football poll for the first time in their history.</p>

<p>When the history of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s second presidency is written, 26 November 2025 may well go down as a particular landmark.</p>
<p>On the eve of Thanksgiving, a lone gunman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">shot</a> two West Virginia national guards, Sarah Beckstrom, and Andrew Wolfe, as they were on patrol outside Washington DC’s Farragut West metro station, a short walk from the White House – and thereby opened the floodgates to a wave of racist and anti-immigrant invective that seemed extreme even for Trump.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Heather Jones, now 33, went public with allegations after Robert Sullivan continued to work with children</p>
<p>The woman who publicly alleged that she was 17 when a longtime Roman Catholic priest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama">Alabama</a> successfully offered her financial support in exchange for sex and other forms of private companionship – recently prompting him to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/robert-sullivan-alabama-catholic-priest">resign</a> from the clergy – says “there is no real winner in this situation”.</p>
<p>In her first remarks since Robert “Bob” Sullivan’s self-imposed removal from the priesthood was announced by his church superiors, Heather Jones wrote in a statement that the only thing she gained was “truth finally coming to light after years of gaslighting myself into thinking it wasn’t a big deal”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A soaring stock market rewards the already well-off but Trump’s handling of the economy has caused his approval ratings to plunge</p>
<p>Entering Printemps in downtown New York City feels like an escape. A slight smell of musk hangs in the air as shoppers weave carefully around racks of coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.</p>
<p>The French luxury retail emporium opened its first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> outlet earlier this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and reds, is reminiscent of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a> movie set.</p>

      <h1>Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup final</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>Inter Miami survived a remarkable double-post escape before Messi and friends sealed the club’s first MLS Cup, giving Busquets and Alba a storybook farewell</p>
<p>The ball was going over the line. Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge. And perhaps most distressingly to Inter Miami, two retiring legends, Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba, would be closing in on ignominious ends. They would have come to MLS to accompany Messi, their friend, but would end their time on the field as losers of a final, the type of game they so often won at club and international level.</p>
<p>All that ball had to do was cross the line. The Vancouver Whitecaps’ Emmanuel Sabbi had imbued it with a seeming destiny after a virtuoso run into the heart of the Inter Miami defense. His left-footed effort wrapped around the outstretched hand of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo. It smacked the inside of the far post. It bounced on the line.</p>

<p>Consider them answered. The Herons are MLS Cup champions after a 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps in the last game at their temporary home, Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Next year, they will open their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, as champions, and will face a high bar to clear to top a turbulent 2025 that saw them play 58 games – an all-time MLS record for games played by a team in a calendar year – for five separate trophies.</p>

It was like a tectonic shift in my reality,” she said.</p>
<p>Tuminez imagined quiet days walking through old churches, sitting in dim chapels in Rome. As part of her spiritual healing, she hoped her schedule held a meeting with Pope Leo. But as her flight landed in Atlanta for a short connection, her phone lit up. One sentence, again and again: “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie has been shot.</a>”</p>

      <h1>Pressure grows on ‘reckless’ Hegseth as twin scandals engulf Pentagon chief</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Defense secretary defiant but allegations of war crimes and blistering watchdog report increase calls for him to go</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> is facing the most serious crisis of his tenure as defense secretary, engulfed by allegations of war crimes in the Caribbean and a blistering <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ba8ad2c-5e41-4c54-ba1d-78e5feb66a2e.pdf">inspector general report</a> accusing him of mishandling classified military intelligence. Yet despite the long list of trouble and as lawmakers from both parties call for his resignation, Hegseth shows no signs of stepping down and still holds Donald Trump’s support.</p>
<p>The twin crises have engulfed the former Fox News personality in separate but overlapping allegations that lawmakers, policy experts and former officials say reveal a pattern of dangerous recklessness at the helm of the Pentagon. Democratic legislators have reignited calls for his ouster after revelations that survivors clinging to wreckage from a September boat strike were deliberately killed in a “double-tap” attack, while a defense department investigation released on Thursday concluded he violated Pentagon policies by sharing sensitive details via the Signal messaging app hours before airstrikes in Yemen.</p>

      <h1>Experts fear for US childhood vaccine schedule after hepatitis B guideline change</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Pediatricians say panel’s decision will create confusion and access issues, and condemn ‘parody of public health’</p>
<p>The entire US childhood vaccine schedule is now open for scrutiny, experts say, after government vaccine advisers took up discussions of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and their components and changed its recommendations on one crucial prevention.</p>
<p>Several of the vaccine advisers are longtime anti-vaccine activists, and they were all chosen by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he fired the previous advisers in an unprecedented move to enact dramatic changes to US vaccination policy. Kennedy has been a frequent critic of vaccines.</p>

Scotland will also face a partial repeat of their last World Cup campaign in 1998 after they were drawn alongside Brazil and Morocco, as well as Haiti, in Group C.</p>
<p>The most prominent candidate for the title of 'Group of Death' is Group I, where the seeds France are joined by Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway alongside the winner of an international playoff. USA face Australia, Paraguay and a European playoff winner.</p>

      <h1>The United States must create big moments at World Cup 2026. Anything less is not enough | Leander Schaerlaeckens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Each nation’s World Cup is defined, for good or bad, by huge, indelible moments. With a favorable draw, the onus is now on the US to create them</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic vividly remembers watching it with his family. So does Tyler Adams, who saw it with his friends from soccer camp. Memories of Tim Howard catching an Algerian header in Pretoria, and hurling it upfield to ignite the counterattack that would lead to Landon Donovan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbn3rOPmR9w&amp;t=56s">instantly iconic</a> goal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm7ievQ2bHo">The goal</a> that spared the United States men’s national team’s blushes at the 2010 World Cup, sneaking them out of the group stage at Algeria’s expense. One of the most iconic moments in US socer history.</p>
<p>Pulisic was a few months from turning 12. Adams had just turned 10. Matt Turner would be 16 the next day, and Howard’s heroics made him wonder if he ought to devote himself fully to becoming a goalkeeper.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Judge seems skeptical of administration’s case and whether any crisis justifying deployment still exists in Los Angeles</p>
<p>The judge presiding over California’s lawsuit against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> challenged the federal government’s authority and rationale for continuing to maintain command over the national guard troops it deployed to Los Angeles earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Trump administration federalized the state’s national guard in June, dispatching about 4,000 troops in response to protests in the city over immigration raids, despite opposition from the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. The state quickly filed a lawsuit, with Newsom calling the move unprecedented and illegal, and the case has been unfolding in the courts for months.</p>

      <p>Memo says the policy shift, which advocates call ‘reckless’, was designed to align with one of Trump’s anti-trans orders</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://prismreports.org/2025/12/04/prison-rape-elimination-act-trans-intersex-trump-doj/">justice department memo</a> issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.</p>

His comments come after B.C.'s Court of Appeal found that the legislation is incompatible with the province's current system used to grant mineral rights because it fails to ensure First Nations are notified when claims are made in their territory.</p>

      <h1>How Farage’s response to racism claims is straight out of Trump’s populist playbook</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Reform UK leader’s legal threats, denials and attacks on the media are tactics often deployed by US president</p>
<p>When Nigel Farage angrily denounced the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/farage-turns-on-broadcasters-racism-allegations-bbc">insulted one of its presenters</a> for raising questions about his alleged schoolboy racism, those who have been studying the tactics of the right noted that his behaviour felt familiar.</p>
<p>“Is it out of the Trump playbook? I think that’s exactly what’s going on,” said Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster. “This is becoming his new modus operandi, turning defence into attack. It’s exactly the tactics White House press secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/karoline-leavitt-white-house-press-conference">Karoline Leavitt</a>, uses. There are a lot of journalists in this country who just aren’t used to it.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence</p>
<p>The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">has formally retracted</a> a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.</p>
<p>Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">note</a> accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.</p>
<p>The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.</p>

      <p>How wired into your brain are tech companies? Spotify offers us a clue. The streaming company runs its Spotify Wrapped marketing campaign every December, taking user data and AI to create a personalized year-in-review for every listener — and it's an incredibly effective marketing move that consumers want to be a part of. Also: a preview of the last Fed meeting of the year and a manufacturing CEO's thoughts on tariffs and factory activity.</p>

      <h1>Pam Bondi tells law enforcement agencies to investigate antifa groups for ‘tax crimes’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Move is part of Trump’s broader crackdown on leftwing groups, including designation of antifa as ‘domestic terrorism’ group</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/05/trump-pete-hegseth-signal-politics-updates">US politics live – latest updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The US attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, instructed law enforcement officials on Thursday to investigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list">antifa</a> and other supposeddomestic terror groups, and specifically directed them to search for “tax crimes” the groups may have committed, according to a memo obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The document signals how the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and Bondi are ramping up efforts to crack down on leftwing groups. Antifa, short for antifascist, is not a clearly defined organization, but rather a loose network of activists. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-executive-order-antifa-terrorist-organization">signed an executive order</a> in September declaring it a domestic terrorism organization – something legal experts say he does not have the authority to do.</p>

      <h1>Digested week: Minor quake hits book lauding bits of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s chest | Emma Brockes</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Defenders rally to Olivia Nuzzi amid book mockery, while rakish David Dimbleby channels his inner Dickens</p>
<p>It’s publication week for American Canto, the hastily turned around memoir by the former New York magazine journalist Olivia Nuzzi, who took on the challenge of explaining what it was about Robert F Kennedy Jr she found so alluring, a task for which no upper word limit is adequate. Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.</p>

      <h1>Netflix is buying Warner Bros. Discovery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Following a fierce bidding war, Netflix announced this morning that it’s buying Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth more than $82 billion. The deal still has to be approved by regulators, and some lawmakers are already raising antitrust concerns. We learn more. Then, as part of our lunar economy mini-series, we hear what a lack of private interest oversight could mean for an economy beyond the clouds.</p>
<p><em>Note: This morning’s podcast has been updated following the official announcement of a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal.</em></p>

<p>Two men who survived a US airstrike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean clung to the wreckage for an hour before they were killed in a second attack, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/video-second-boat-strike-military-caribbean">a video of the episode shown to senators</a> in Washington.</p>
<p>The men were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible radio or other communications equipment. They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that the US military was weighing whether to finish them off, two sources familiar with the recording told Reuters.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Major airports in India have descended into chaos after the airline IndiGo either canceled or delayed hundreds of flights for the fourth consecutive day. IndiGo says there have been technical issues with aircraft or winter schedules that have delayed some flights, but the biggest reason is a pilot shortage. Also, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal, and some countries are boycotting Eurovision over Israel's involvement.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration has been trying for months to ban AI regulations at the state level. And its latest gambit to roll such a measure into the congressional National Defense Authorization Act appears to have failed. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that GOP leadership is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/another-bid-to-block-state-ai-regulation-has-failedfor-now/">“looking at other places”</a> to include that measure after reportedly facing pushback from both parties.</p>
<p>Plus, New York recently became the first state to enforce an AI law designed to protect consumers from &quot;algorithmic pricing.&quot; And Amazon pulled back on AI dubbing for some international content after anime fans complained.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami’s journey to MLS Cup has been methodical, and Messi-centered</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Ever since the club’s very beginning, David Beckham and Jorge Mas have had moments like this Saturday in mind</p>
<p>Back on 27 February 2020, days before Inter Miami’s first-ever fixture in MLS, I stood next to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas, and co-owner David Beckham as part of an MLS press junket in New York City. I was there for Sports Illustrated and my show Planet Fútbol TV, which I co-hosted with my friend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/grant-wahl-death-world-cup-qatar-2022-tribute-soccer">the late, great Grant Wahl</a>. We were adamant that the Inter Miami story was riveting, not just because of Beckham’s influence in MLS, but also because his new club was about to introduce the unique culture of Miami and south Florida – the Latin American capital of the world – to the league.</p>
<p>The conversation in 2020 was my second meeting with Mas and my first with Beckham. I remember the sense of excitement from both men, knowing that this Inter Miami project – seven years in the making before their debut in the league – was about to come to fruition after a long, arduous journey. From legal battles with Internazionale over the trademark of the word “Inter” to political and structural problems as they tried to make a stadium, Miami Freedom Park, a reality. Now, the club was finally starting life in MLS.</p>

<p>TikTok has introduced new features to build healthy habits for teens, including breathing exercises, soothing sounds and an affirmation journal. But while TikTok is pitching its new wellness features as a win for teens' mental health, critics fear it's a further push toward tech apps monopolizing our downtime to collect ever more data.</p>

      <p>Daughter of James Comey was dismissed by Trump justice department from job as prosecutor in New York</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/who-is-maurene-comey-fired-federal-prosector">Maurene Comey</a>, the federal prosecutor who helmed criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, appeared at Manhattan federal court on Thursday, in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/epstein-prosecutor-maurene-comey-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> claiming she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/maurene-comey-fired-sources">fired</a> as political retaliation against her father, James Comey.</p>
<p>Comey was terminated in July, shortly after the federal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, whose prosecution she led; he was found guilty of prostitution-related crimes. Comey’s lawsuit contends that Donald Trump’s justice department axed her without explanation or cause, and instead simply cited “article 2 of the United States constitution and the laws of the United States” in an email.</p>

      <p>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered</p>
<p>Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The supreme court’s decision came after a 2-1 ruling from a three-judge panel striking down Texas’s new map in November. The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.</p>

<p>Marco Odermatt of Switzerland won the downhill season-opener Thursday, beating American Ryan Cochran-Siegle in a World Cup race on a tricky but shorter Birds of Prey course.</p>
<p>Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.</p>

      <p>Zoe Rosenberg, 23, studying at UC Berkeley, had said it was a ‘rescue’ and ‘will not apologize’ for her actions</p>
<p>A California student has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after breaking into a Petaluma poultry and taking four chickens in an effort she called a “rescue”.</p>
<p>Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, was convicted of felony conspiracy and three misdemeanor counts in October. On Wednesday, a jury sentenced her to 90 days – 60 of which may involve jail alternates, such as house arrest – far less than the four and a half year maximum sentence she could have faced. The jury also ordered Rosenberg to pay more than $100,000 to Petaluma Poultry, the Perdue Farms facility from which she took four chickens in 2023. Rosenberg has been ordered to report to the Sonoma county jail on 10 December.</p>

<p>Top Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress on Thursday said that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had not ordered the military to kill surviving members of a deadly attack on a boat alleged to be carrying drugs in the Caribbean, but differed over whether the double strike was appropriate.</p>
<p>The allegation that Hegseth ordered the killing of survivors sparked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/venezuela-boat-strikes-legality-hegseth">bipartisan concern</a> in Washington that he or others involved may have committed a war crime. On Thursday, US navy admiral Frank Bradley, who commanded the attack, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Dan Caine, appeared before the House and Senate’s armed services and intelligence committees for a closed briefing in which they showed video and discussed the attack with lawmakers.</p>

      <p>An investigation found defense secretary put US forces at risk, triggering fresh demands for his resignation</p>
<p>The Department of Defense’s inspector general released the much-anticipated unclassified <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/04/2003834916/-1/-1/1/DODIG_2026_021.PDF">report</a> on Thursday about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>’s disclosure of plans for military airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal group chat earlier this year.</p>
<p>It found that Hegseth violated departmental policies when he shared information in the chat, and that if a foreign enemy force intercepted that information it could have endangered the lives of US troops, as the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/hegseth-yemen-signal-group-chat">reported on Wednesday</a>. “Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,” the report said.</p>

<p>After a contentious meeting, vaccine advisers for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voted on Thursday to delay a vote on restricting hepatitis B vaccination for infants.</p>
<p>The meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) turned confrontational at times before one member introduced a motion to delay the vote, which passed by six to three, to give advisers time to examine the wording before taking a vote.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump went on another extended racist tirade against Somalis on Wednesday, Minneapolis activists prepared for more targeting of the community by conducting trainings on their rights and planning how they would protect their neighbors.</p>
<p>In the White House on Wednesday, a reporter asked the president about Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, who has defended the Somali community. Trump responded: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian – look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. Billions and billions.”</p>

      <p>These days, Americans are drinking less alcohol. While that may be a positive from a health perspective, it’s not great news for California grape growers. Industry groups predict that 2025 will be the smallest harvest since the mid-’90s. These changing consumption habits are changing the landscape of California vineyards. Also, the Trump administration is reducing fuel efficiency standards, and layoffs are running high ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.</p>
<p>USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.</p>

      <h1>‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detainees face human rights violations, report alleges | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Amnesty finds detainees at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage. Plus, how the dollar-store industry overcharges consumers</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.</p>
<p><strong>Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?</strong> A federal judge in August <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling">ordered it to close</a> after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck">has close ties</a> to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?</strong> The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.</p>
<p><strong>Why have they released these photos now?</strong> It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, signed 19 November.</p>

      <h1>Meta faces an investigation over AI in WhatsApp</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European antitrust regulators have just launched an investigation into Meta over its rollout of artificial intelligence features on WhatsApp for European users. This move marks the latest action by European regulators against large technology firms, as the trade bloc seeks to balance support for the sector with efforts to curb its expanding influence. Then, air travelers in India face continued disruptions, and Japan tries to regain a stronghold in semiconductor chip manufacturing.</p>

      <h1>Killing of survivors sparks outrage – but entire US ‘drug boat’ war is legally shaky</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Pentagon’s Law of War manual clearly prohibits attack, but justification for whole campaign also faces tough questions</p>
<p>Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.</p>
<p>A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.</p>

      <p>Experts say any change to the hepatitis B schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences</p>
<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr’s vaccine advisory committee convenes on Thursday to consider a reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to delay hepatitis B shots for newborn babies.</p>
<p>For decades, federal health recommendations have suggested that all newborns be vaccinated against the virus that can lead to serious liver disease. Kennedy, the US health secretary and a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot.</p>

      <h1>Have we given up on data privacy?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Every day, consumers are confronted with the fragility of our personal data privacy — another data breach, another government agency accessing databases they didn't previously have access to, another consent form popping up to get permission to gather more data.</p>
<p>It's almost too much for any one person to keep a handle on, according to Rohan Grover, professor of artificial intelligence and media at American University. He recently co-authored a piece for The Conversation about why data privacy seems to have largely fallen out of the public discourse, even though he says the topic is more urgent than ever.</p>

      <h1>Wilfried Nancy’s move to Celtic means as much for MLS as it does for him</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>New Celtic manager may not be a big name but he won over the US league with leadership style and attractive football</p>
<p>Other managers won more in Major League Soccer than Wilfried Nancy. Bruce Arena, say, certainly has a fuller trophy cabinet. Nancy, however, lifted more than just trophies. He lifted standards. At Columbus Crew, he set a benchmark for the rest, showing what was possible even with limited resources. Columbus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/29/mls-cup-inter-miami-vancouver-whitecaps-san-diego-nycfc">didn’t have Lionel Messi</a> or Son Heung-min, but they had Nancy as head coach, and that was often enough.</p>
<p>For the past three seasons, the Crew have been the most dynamic, boundary-pushing team in MLS. Nancy’s CF Montreal team weren’t bad either, establishing the style of play that would come to be known as Nancyball. He changed MLS’s managerial landscape for ever. It was only a matter of time until a call came from Europe.</p>

      <h1>Jaxson Dart says the NFL ‘isn’t soccer’. The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The rookie plays like a linebacker at quarterback. His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himself</p>
<p>Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: <em>this is real football</em>. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">taking the latest</a> in a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.”</p>
<p>Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Dart <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">took another heavy hit</a> near the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots.

<p>While watching the World Series this fall, you may have noticed a series of ads from the Ontario government about the Ring of Fire, a mineral deposit in the James Bay lowlands that's long been eyed as a critical mineral source. Critics are speaking out about the use of stock footage in the ads, saying it doesn’t actually show the Ring of Fire. Here's what we found out.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon watchdog finds Hegseth’s use of Signal posed risk to US personnel, AP sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The Pentagon’s watchdog has found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen. That's according to two people familiar with the findings on Wednesday. One of the people says Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly. Hegseth denied posting classified information regarding plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen in March. The review by the Pentagon inspector general’s office was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Small business owners’ economic moods remain mixed. But, as is so often the case, how folks feel is different from how they act. And hard data tells us small business owners are pulling back on hiring — one ADP report shows businesses with fewer than 50 employees cut a net 120,000 jobs in November. Should we be worried? Plus: Retailers benefit from buy now, pay later offerings, import prices sans fuel rose in September, and cap-and-trade carbon emissions programs have changed since their inception.</p>

      <h1>The Clippers’ chaotic unravelling leaves Chris Paul as its most painful casualty</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Los Angeles have turned a feelgood reunion into a late-career humiliation for one of their greatest players – and exposed a franchise stumbling into a darker new era</p>
<p>Pull out your Los Angeles Clippers bingo cards. Anyone have the square marked “owner and star player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/clippers-deny-claims-star-forward-kawhi-leonard-was-paid-28m-for-job-that-didnt-exist">accused of skirting the salary cap</a> through improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/clippers-chris-paul-sent-home-stunning-late-night-move">wee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning</a>, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”.</p>
<p>The Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister.</p>

      <h1>The environmental costs of corn: should the US change how it grows its dominant crop?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Amid concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration has abolished climate-friendly farming incentives</p>
<p><em>This article was produced in partnership</em> <em>with <a href="https://floodlightnews.org/">Floodlight</a></em></p>
<p>For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90m acres – about the size of Montana – and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce weaker fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks at a White House event today. The move will likely reverse a Biden-era rule requiring automakers to reach an average of 50 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2031.

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Alejandro Carranza Medina’s relatives say he was a fisher, not a drug trafficker. Plus, Putin says Russia ‘ready’ for war with Europe as Ukraine talks stall</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A family in Colombia has filed a petition with the Washington DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), alleging that the Colombian citizen Alejandro Carranza Medina was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/trump-caribbean-drug-boat-attack-complaint">subject to an “extrajudicial killing”</a> in a US airstrike.</p>
<p><strong>What is the IACHR?</strong> A monitoring body designed to “promote and protect human rights in the western hemisphere”. The US is a member, and the state department said in March it was a “strong supporter of the IACHR”.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> <strong>ow has the Trump administration responded?</strong> A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, did not respond directly to questions about the complaint or about Carranza’s death, but wrote in an email that the media were “now running cover for foreign terrorists smuggling deadly narcotics intended to murder Americans”.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the front</strong> <strong>lines?</strong> Buoyed up by recent gains, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European politicians have reached a provisional agreement to phase out imports of Russian gas by 2027. Exports of oil and gas have been crucial for Russia to fund its military campaign in Ukraine. Russia says Europe will be less competitive and that consumers will have to pay higher prices. Then, we'll check in on Japan's work-life balance and hear about a diamond-studded Faberge egg, which just sold at auction for $30 million.</p>

<p>During a federal trial in North Carolina over whether a new voter registration law discriminates against college students, a prominent rightwing election integrity activist previewed Republicans’ long-range plans to end same-day registration.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Schroeder is deliberating over the future of provisions in Senate bill 747, which increased registration requirements for voters who cast ballots on the same day they register to vote during North Carolina’s early voting period. Schroeder called for briefs at the end of November after a week-long trial in Winston-Salem.</p>

<p>On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.</p>
<p>Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.</p>

<p>Trump administration officials have defended carrying out a follow-up strike on a drug boat that killed survivors on 2 September by arguing that its objective was to ensure the complete destruction of the boat, an action the Pentagon had internal legal approval to conduct.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Monday that Adm Frank Bradley, who oversaw the operation and gave the order for the second strike, directed it to sink the boat.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve’s quantitative approach to monetary policy decisions means its governors tend to reach consensus.

In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and former FOMC member Daniel Tarullo discuss why the Fed is divided right now. Plus: Dollar stores weather an uncertain economy, companies use return-to-office policies as a workforce reduction mechanism, and electricity demand grows as data centers pop up nationwide.</p>

      <p>Donation of $6.25bn for children’s investment accounts prompts wave of questions – but details remain scarce</p>
<p>A tech billionaire and his wife said on Tuesday they would pour $6.25bn into individual investment accounts for 25 million children under 10, prompting a wave of new questions about how these so-called “Trump accounts” will work.</p>
<p>The creation of these accounts was included as part of Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and spending bill, which he signed into law in July. Every child born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, can receive a Trump account that includes a $1,000 initial deposit from the administration. The money will then be invested.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary said that the decision to re-strike the “narco terrorist vessel” was made by Adm Frank M Bradley, “operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”. Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.</p>

<p>The US Soccer Federation announced on Tuesday that the national team will play Belgium and Portugal in the March Fifa window, with both matches taking place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on 28 and 31 March, respectively. Those matches will be followed by two friendlies in the window immediately preceding the World Cup, with the second one coming against Germany in Chicago on 6 June. The first game of the pre-World Cup series is against an opponent to be determined in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 31 May. Multiple reports have indicated that the opponent will be announced after the World Cup draw. (Fifa rules forbid group opponents from playing each other in a friendly ahead of the tournament.)</p>

      <p>Billionaires contribute to new investment accounts for children created as part of Trump legislation</p>
<p>Billionaires Michael and Susan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/dell">Dell</a> pledged $6.25bn on Tuesday to provide 25 million American children under 10 an incentive to claim the new investment accounts for children created as part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> tax and spending legislation.</p>
<p>The historic gift has little precedent, with few single charitable commitments in the past 25 years exceeding $1bn, much less multiple billions. Announced on GivingTuesday, the Dells believe it’s the largest single private commitment made to US children.</p>

Hegseth also denied knowledge of it, but stated the admiral ‘had the complete authority’ to launch it</p>

<p>Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.</p>
<p>Williams, 44, has not played an official match since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement">her run to the third round of the US Open</a> more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.</p>

<p>A post on social media by US defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, depicting a beloved children’s character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book’s Canadian publisher.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.</p>

      <h1>What Trump’s asylum ‘pause’ means – and what it doesn’t</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>The US president has halted decisions on many asylum claims, but the scope, legality and real-world effects of the pause remain unclear</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghani national who assisted US forces during the two-decade war there and was paroled into the United States in 2021. US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the president’s asylum pause will last. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/30/donald-trump-pause-asylum-applications/87544306007/">Trump told reporters Sunday</a> that the directive “has no time limit, but it could be a long time”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Corporate bond spreads, extra compensation that corporate bonds pay out compared to government bonds, have been narrowing this year, which means investors aren’t demanding much additional money to account for additional credit risk. That could indicate that investors think economic growth could pick up in the near term. Also on the program: a trade deal regarding U.K. pharmaceuticals and OPEC's plans to keep oil production flat to start the new year.</p>

<p>The revelation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/trinidad-and-tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> has approved the installation of a US military radar facility has stoked fears that the Caribbean could be drawn into the escalating crisis between the US and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had attempted to allay concerns about a US C-17 aircraft that had landed in the country, claiming it was carrying marines to assist with a road construction project. She also claimed she was told that no marines remained in the country.</p>

      <p>Your essential guide to Friday’s draw in Washington DC, including where to watch it, who to watch out for and a look at Fifa’s peace prize</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a> draw will start at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center at 12pm local time on Friday 5 December (5pm GMT/4am Saturday AEST). Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Agreement could cost NHS an extra £3bn a year, industry sources estimate</p>
<p>The UK has agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/08/nhs-could-pay-25-more-for-medicines-under-plan-to-end-row-with-drugmakers-and-trump?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other">25% more</a> for new medicines by 2035 as part of a US-UK drug pricing deal that will cost an estimated additional £3bn a year.</p>
<p>The transatlantic agreement will also see the health service in England, which currently spends £14.4bn a year on innovative therapies, double the percentage of GDP it allocates to buying such products, from 0.3% to 0.6% over the next decade.</p>

      <h1>Fuzzy Zoeller obituary</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Popular American golfer hailed for winning the US Masters and the US Open</p>
<p>The golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who has died aged 74, won two majors – the US Masters in 1979 and the US Open in 1984, both by virtue of a playoff. His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC-pC_S6aTs">high into the air</a> as the ball disappeared into the cup.</p>
<p>Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6_Mx9YmgU">mock surrender</a>. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq6SG_Qzpxg">flapping</a> his own white towel at the 18th.</p>

      <p>You’ve heard of caregivers in the sandwich generation. In this anti-compassion Trump 2.0 era, it’s more like a triple-decker sandwich. Alissa Quart has experienced this first-hand</p>
<p>It was a crisp autumn day day, but I had been trapped inside for hours, breathing the cold air of one of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s cancer centers with my mom. We were waiting for her latest infusion to finish dripping.</p>
<p>Time in hospitals moves differently – minutes stretch and lose their meaning. Meanwhile, my daughter kept calling. Would I be able to go to her school volleyball game? After a few calls, I had to break it to her: the answer was no.</p>

      <p>On today's show, we're lifting the veil on a little-known profession in the legal field: private judges. These are judges that businesses or individuals resort to when traditional courts are too slow, too expensive, or too time-consuming. But first, AI is helping out with our holiday shopping. Adobe Analytics says traffic to retail websites that originated from AI tools like chatbots was up 805% compared to last year.</p>

      <p>Morgan Geyser, who stabbed a classmate as a 12-year-old, fled after a decade being raised by state institutions</p>
<p>The haunting apparition of “Slender Man” reappeared last week when Morgan Geyser, a central character in an 11-year-old attempted murder case, briefly absconded from a Wisconsin care home to which she had been transferred after being released from a psychiatric institution over the summer.</p>
<p>Geyser was 12 in 2014 when she pleaded guilty to stabbing a sixth-grade classmate to appease the mythical Slender Man.</p>

<p>Fresh off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/democrat-election-wins-across-america-caution-around-hope-mamdani-spanberger">a wave of successes</a> in November’s off-year elections, Democrats are angling for an audacious victory in a Republican-heavy Tennessee congressional district where an upset win could amount to a major blow against Donald Trump’s legislative agenda.</p>
<p>Voters on Tuesday will cast ballots in a special election to replace Mark Green, a Republican representing a middle Tennessee district who resigned from Congress in July. Drawn by the state’s Republican leaders to ensure its voters favored their party, the district last year backed Trump and Green by 22-point margins.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Factories in China have long been an engine of economic growth, so it's worrying for leaders in Beijing that a new survey shows activity unexpectedly contracted in November. It's the eighth straight month that production has shrunk. What's it telling us about the world's second biggest economy? And later, Iran is experiencing an unprecedented drought, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In MLS and NWSL alike, edge-of-your-seat contests have delivered indelible moments that even the best title race run-in can’t match</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx6vDNKVAo">a TV commercial</a> that’s been running on Apple TV during MLS games for Lowe’s hardware stores. Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).</p>
<p>Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/24/lionel-messi-mls-viewership-attendance-apple-tv">smashed up the league</a> this year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.</p>

      <h1>In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contenders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>San Francisco are a flawed team with serious injuries. But with no great teams in the league this year, the playoffs are wide open</p>
<p>The 49ers’ season felt over after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers">Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay</a>. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner <a href="https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/">was the latest casualty</a>, following <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php">in the footsteps</a> of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.</p>
<p>Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers.</p>

<p>This unique form of theft has been happening all over the Greater Toronto Area and beyond. Thieves on the hunt for cash break through the walls of banks using excavators that experts say anyone capable of ordering a key online can drive off the lot.</p>

      <p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/ais/b160fe9c-f2a8-490b-a969-72f55ff4bd73,1760988313788/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1920%2C1080%29%3BResize%3D%28620%29" alt="Abstract image of a burner on a stove"></p>
<p>Over the weekend, Donald Trump declared on Truth Social that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed. Venezuela’s foreign ministry responded by calling the comments &quot;another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people&quot;.
Late last week, Trump also said that land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in the country could start very soon.
All of this is happening amidst a serious military buildup in the Caribbean and escalating threats to remove Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro from power.
Is this the buildup to an invasion? And is it really about drugs? Or do Venezuela's massive oil reserves have something to do with it?
Jon Lee Anderson is our guest. He’s a staff writer with The New Yorker, and has written extensively about U.S.-Venezuela relations and U.S. interference in Latin America.

<p>CBC News spoke with five paramedics who say they’ve been sent out to respond to 911 calls unnecessarily — either because the call had already been handled by another team and reappeared in the system, or because several ambulances were dispatched to the same call. Urgences-santé, meanwhile, insists there’s been no impact on patient care since the system was implemented.</p>

<p>During the third-quarter of Sunday’s game between the Commanders and Broncos, the Washington receiver reached behind him as he fell backwards in the end zone and grabbed a Marcus Mariota pass with his right hand. He secured the ball as he fell to the turf and his touchdown tied the game at 13-13.</p>

<p>Bryce Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns – two of them coming on fourth down – and the Carolina Panthers (7-6) forced three turnovers by Matthew Stafford to beat Los Angeles (9-3) and snap the Rams’ six-game winning streak. Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.</p>

      <p>Daniel DiDonato, 18, drafted new state senate districts at home on free software – and a judge picked his map ahead of professionals’ efforts to remedy voting rights violations</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after years of litigation, a federal judge in Alabama ordered a new state senate map. In a surprising decision, the map she chose wasn’t one drafted by a court-appointed special master and his expert cartographer, but rather one that had been submitted by an anonymous member of the public, known only by their initials, “DD”.</p>
<p>The decision stunned “DD” – an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama named Daniel DiDonato – who learned his map had been selected as he was preparing to leave for his 9.30am introduction to political science class.</p>

      <p>Parts of the US economy are doing just fine but many are struggling to make rent, let alone splurging on gifts</p>
<p>Will retailers and merchants have a strong holiday season? That depends. This year, more than most, the 2025 holiday season will actually be two holiday seasons.</p>
<p>If your business caters to higher-income individuals or if you’re located in a wealthier part of the country, you’ll probably have a decent holiday season. True, even the wealthy are cutting back. But according to the HR firm ADP average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/economic-opportunity/household-income">some parts of the country</a>, notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income is over <span class="math inline">\(125,000 - almost \)</span>41,000 higher than the national average. People in this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.</p>

<p>Cooper Flagg became the youngest-ever player to score 35 points in an NBA game as he helped the Dallas Mavericks rally to a 114-110 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old went 13 for 22 from the field in his 20th career game. The top pick in this year’s draft also grabbed eight rebounds. The only other 18-year-old to score 35 points in an NBA game is LeBron James, who did so twice in his rookie season. His first came when he was 18 years and 348 days old, five days older than Flagg was on Saturday.</p>

      <h1>‘We have become so divided’: Georgia district prepares for life after Marjorie Taylor Greene</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats alike look to fill congressional firebrand’s House seat when she departs in 2026</p>
<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene for president. Randy Bone rolled the idea around in his hands for a second as he stood inside his wife’s antique shop in Ringgold, Georgia. He’s heard the talk. He’s even seen the prediction market action. He doesn’t have a problem with his boisterous, attention-seeking congresswoman. He just doesn’t think it will work.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t see her as one that is very attractive … You’ve got to focus on those that are kind of in the middle, and I don’t think that she’s unifying enough,” he said.</p>

<p>Acquiring solar panels at home can be an expensive hassle for people in the US. But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Utah became the first state in the country to pass legislation allowing people to purchase and install small, portable solar panels that plug into a standard wall socket.</p>

      <h1>Gutting of key US watchdog could pave way for grave immigration abuses, experts warn</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms</p>
<p>The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.</p>
<p>Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">pushes</a> aggressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/">CRCL document</a> confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.</p>
<p>Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">document</a>.This included an investigation into a <a href="https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/">2024 incident</a> during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">complaint</a>, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.</p>
<p>In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf">complaint</a> submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.</p>
<p>Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf">complaint</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>From Vietnam to the Balkans, Donald Trump’s family has launched a global dealmaking blitz since his re-election</p>
<p>A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.</p>
<p>All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.</p>

      <p>
      <p>People implicated in the late sex offender’s crimes could face criminal charges or, at the least, social ostracism</p>
<p>As the clock ticks toward the congressionally mandated deadline of 19 December by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release its files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, there is intense speculation about the contents of these documents – but also questions as to what happens when they are released.</p>
<p>The US president on 19 November signed a bipartisan bill requiring that the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, disclose these documents to the US public within 30 days. Given that other tranches of materials related to the disgraced financier included damning correspondence with high-profile individuals, many expect that still more names of the rich, famous and powerful will be named.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s hate-filled rant ignores facts on immigrant crime and economic benefits</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>In the wake of the deadly Washington DC shooting, Trump claimed immigrants are ‘destroying everything America stands for’. Here’s what the data shows</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy">bolster the US economy</a> and commit crimes at far <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more">lower rates</a> than people born in the US.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516">a broad and vicious invective</a>, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.</p>

<p>Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term. Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.</p>

      <p>But for years now, Russia has gotten around some of these sanctions through its so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; — unidentified tankers sailing with no flag or fake flags. These boats are also often uninsured, and European naval officials say the shadow fleet is growing. Are the rules of the sea now in rough waters? Also on the program: frank reflections on the uneasiness that can come with interacting with AI slop.</p>

      <p>Shaped by lockdown and two Trump presidencies, gen Z are grappling with a lot in love, dating and the bedroom</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">The sex lives of gen Z</a> are of great interest – to politicians, to parents, to influencers and dating app executives and to you, apparently. Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?</p>
<p>Gen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teens <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf">reported</a> first seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has struck a deal for a 700-mile pipeline carrying 1 million barrels of oil a day to Canada's West Coast in an attempt to pivot away from reliance on the U.S. economy. The project is likely to face multiple legal challenges, however. Plus, Kenyan farmers have won a case over food sovereignty and a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; is suspected of covertly generating billions for Moscow.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has said he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/trump-says-he-will-permanently-pause-migration-from-third-world-countries-after-national-guard-shooting">“permanently pause migration from all third world countries”</a>, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the other guard member?</strong> Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.</p>
<p><strong>What does Trump mean by</strong> <strong>‘third world</strong> <strong>’?</strong> He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>What has Warren said about Staley?</strong> She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.</p>

      <p>The entertainment giant is building almost 2,000 homes in California’s Palm Springs area so beloved by its founder</p>
<p>The Coachella valley typically brings a few things to mind: hot desert sun, the most Instagrammable music festival in the country, and even more sun. What it doesn’t bring to mind, however, is the family-friendly, Mickey Mouse-eared nostalgia associated with all things Disney. But that may be changing.</p>
<p>In 2022, Disney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/disney-california-storyliving-community-rancho-mirage">announced plans to build a first-of-its-kind branded residential community</a>, which they have named “Storyliving by Disney”. The first of the Storyliving communities, Cotino, is officially welcoming residents into model homes in Rancho Mirage, a city nestled in Coachella valley. When all plans are finished, the 618-acre community will feature almost 2,000 residential units, including single-family homes and condos.</p>

      <p>Ex-member of the hip-hop group was convicted of money laundering and campaign finance violations after funneling money from a rich Malaysian</p>
<p>From the moment the Fugees shot to fame in the mid-90s, Prakazrel “Pras” Michél was discounted as an incidental member of the hip-hop superstars. He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.</p>
<p>“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.</p>

      <h1>AI's role in improving accessibility</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Accessibility has long been aided by the advancement of technology. When it comes to artificial intelligence, accessibility is top of mind for Taylor Arndt, Chief Operations Officer at Techopolis Online Solutions. Arndt has been blind since birth, and so accessibility has been a lifelong battle. When she was in school, she often received physical materials she was unable to read. So, she bought her own hand-held scanner and downloaded a screen reader. At 14, Arndt taught herself to code. Now as a coder working on AI, Arndt says in order for it to help others, the AI models need to be trained on data that has already incorporated accessibility measures.</p>

      <p>Tech investors promise to disrupt everything from padel to basketball, but their pitch-deck jargon is slowly draining the humanity from sport itself</p>
<p>Finally, a sector more ludicrously hyped than AI. Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnett <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/project-bs-ambitious-plans-to-reshape-womens-basketball--and-mens-too-154515719.html?guccounter=1">declared</a> that “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/">was the most watched ever</a>. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69250fa1&amp;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D">accounted for</a> half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/">to have been removed</a> from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.</p>

      <p>Exclusive: It follows calls from US senator Elizabeth Warren to investigate bank executives including ex-Barclays boss Jes Staley</p>
<p>US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.</p>
<p>In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein">had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren</a>, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.</p>

      <p>As navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead market</p>
<p>Flying drones used during the Ukraine war have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart">changed land battle tactics</a> for ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.</p>
<p>Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/ghost-shark-submarine-drone-australian-navy-explainer">on “Ghost Shark” submarines</a> to counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.</p>

<p>For the first time since 1988 the US government said it will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/world-aids-day">no longer commemorate World Aids Day</a>, which honors those who have lost their lives to the disease, celebrates efforts to combat the epidemic and raises awareness.</p>

Today we’re sharing an episode from the latest season of Marketplace’s climate podcast, <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/11/05/the-dry-line">“How We Survive,”</a> that has to do with the future of what’s on your dinner table. As the planet heats up, the climate of the Midwest is changing. It’s pushing the invisible line separating the humid East and arid West eastward which has major implications for our food supply.

<p>Small changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.</p>

      <h1>Washington DC national guard shooting: what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe</p>
<p>Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.</p>
<p>The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">hospitalized in critical condition</a>.</p>
<p>The suspect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">Rahmanullah Lakanwal</a>, 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard">national guard members</a> die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.</p>
<p>His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.</p>
<p>He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.</p>
<p>He is believed to have acted alone.</p>
<p>Lakanwal worked with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">CIA in Afghanistan</a>, and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>US citizenship and immigration services also <a href="https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163">said</a> it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.</p>

Like it or not, artificial intelligence is with us. Today, we hear the story of one educator who's trying to prepare her students to use AI responsibly. Plus, professional soccer in Britain has long attracted foreign investment — increasingly from folks Stateside. We'll learn how Americans' involvement is shaping the game.</p>

      <p>Maher Tarabishi was arrested at a routine visit despite decades in the US, leaving his son with Pompe disease</p>
<p>A 62-year-old father named Maher Tarabishi visited the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a> field office in Dallas, Texas, on 28 October as he has done each year for 17 years. Tarabishi, originally from Jordan, is in the US on a supervision order. Even though his asylum claim was denied, the US government allowed him to remain in the country because he is the primary caretaker for his son, Wael, who was diagnosed at four years old with a progressive muscle disorder called Pompe disease.</p>
<p>Tarabishi’s mandatory annual visits to ICE were never eventful; he’d arrive, an official might ask about Wael’s condition, and then he would leave. This time was different.</p>

      <p>Can a new CEO help turn things around? It’s a rocky time for regional theme parks that aren’t major travel destinations, as they compete for visitors and their discretionary income. Six Flags is hoping new CEO John Reilly, a veteran theme park operator, will help boost ticket sales and revenue. Plus, the future of the CDFI fund and community lender support remains uncertain, and we hear how Social Security offers a lifeline to some grandparents raising grandkids.</p>

      <h1>Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USA</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A few years ago James Cook worked in a Surrey cinema and Max Pircher played in Austria. Now they’re in the NFL</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p>
<p>The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.</p>
<p>Cook has been in charge of player development at Cleveland Browns for the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe. He got as far as playing for Great Britain but his plans to go to college in the US proved financially prohibitive.</p>

Structural issues like the lack of political stability in many countries and lagging infrastructure remain major barriers to high quality job creation. But the gig economy has been growing rapidly thanks to the proliferation of digital platforms. The The BBC's Wairimu Gitani reports.</p>

      <h1>The Super Bowl Shuffle at 40: how a goofy rap classic boosted the Bears’ title run</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A new documentary charts how a song that featured a 335lb rapper and bad dancing went viral in the pre-internet era</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears are 8-3 and soaring in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings">this season’s NFL standings</a>. For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.</p>
<p>Before the 1985 edition of the Bears romped to victory in Super Bowl XX, they tempted fate by recording The Super Bowl Shuffle. Although the song only peaked at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooT_uz--O2A&amp;t=3s">the accompanying video</a> came to rival Michael Jackson’s Thriller for popularity as it popped up endlessly on TV during the Bears’ title run. “The Super Bowl Shuffle went viral in an age where there was no viral existence like we know it today,” the song’s recording engineer, Fred Breitberg, says. “It was a phenomenal entity as well as being a good record.”</p>

She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/us-citizens-jailed-ice-los-angeles">her attorney described</a> as a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>Don Bacon, a Republican representative, called for Steve Witkoff’s immediate dismissal. “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign &amp; democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians,” the Nebraska lawmaker <a href="https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/1993446393076498714?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

      <p>New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that earning a college degree can still help you keep a job and get higher wages, but it’s less of an advantage than it used to be. ​The unemployment gap between college graduates and those with just a high school diploma is narrowing. Also: a handful of stocks driving economic growth, a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, and life as a 67-year-old retiree.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Katie Wilson’s rise from transit campaigner to city hall shows how trust, volunteers and years of organizing overcame big-money politics</p>
<p>While a blue wave was sweeping key races in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City, Virginia, and New Jersey on 4 November, Seattle progressives were biting their nails down to a quick. At 8pm, only the first round of ballots had been counted in Seattle, and Katie Wilson, a longtime community organizer and the progressive challenger in the mayoral race, was behind by seven points.</p>
<p>But it was far from over. Because Washington tate votes almost entirely by mail, that first ballot count was less than a quarter of the vote. As the week wore on, and progressives’ fingernails disappeared, Wilson’s share of the vote crept up, slowly but steadily. Eight days after the election, Seattle declared that Wilson would be the next mayor of Seattle.</p>

<p>“Open Society Foundations supports the right of free speech, supports the constitutional rights of organizations to be able to organize themselves, including through peaceful protest and is willing to actually ensure that those rights are upheld, including by going to court if need be,” she said.</p>

      <h1>Trump envoy Witkoff reportedly advised Kremlin official on Ukraine peace deal | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Witkoff also offered tactical guidance on how Putin should raise subject with Trump, audio recording suggests. Plus, the female pilots on Ukraine’s frontline</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk</a> and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>What did Witkoff say?</strong> “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?</strong> It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.</p>
<p><strong>What have the White House said?</strong> A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Human rights monitors say it is not safe to return, citing reports of ‘serious crimes in the run-up to elections’</p>
<p>Myanmar’s junta applauded the Trump administration on Wednesday for halting a scheme that protected its citizens from deportation from the US back to their war-racked homeland.</p>
<p>About 4,000 Myanmar citizens are living in the US with temporary protected status (TPS), which shields foreign nationals from deportation to disaster zones and allows them the right to work.</p>

      <p>The world of soccer throws up no shortage of questions. Today, Graham Ruthven endeavors to answer three of them</p>
<p>This time last season, Liverpool had just registered their 10th win in 12 games to go nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. It was around this time the narrative around Slot’s team shifted from questioning if they could win the title in their first season post-Jürgen Klopp to predicting just how far ahead of the chasing pack they would finish. A year on, the narrative has shifted tremendously.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has said his plan to end the war in Ukraine 'is making progress' and he is sending his special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Vladimir Putin and his army secretary, Dan Driscoll, to meet Ukrainian officials. The US president told journalists aboard Air Force One that his son-in-law Jared Kushner might join the Witkoff-Putin meeting. Trump backed away from an earlier Thursday deadline for Ukraine to agree to a US-backed peace plan, saying: 'The deadline for me is when it’s over'</p>

      <p>Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews. It comes a day after the Pentagon announced it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters Tuesday that Trump “is attempting to use the FBI to scare us.” The inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes.</p>

      <h1>Judge orders Trump administration to provide bond hearings to detained migrants</h1>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>District judge in California says detainees who were already living in the US are legally entitled to a bond hearing</p>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that Donald Trump’s administration cannot impose mandatory detention on thousands of migrants held by US immigration authorities without first giving them an opportunity to seek release on bond.</p>
<p>US district judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, certified a nationwide class of individuals who were already living in the United States when they were detained and are legally entitled to a hearing to determine whether they can be released on bond while their deportation cases proceed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is framing its boat strikes against drug cartels in the Caribbean in part as a collective self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region, according to three people directly familiar with the administration’s internal legal argument.</p>
<p>The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.</p>

<p>Senator <strong>Mark Kelly</strong> has responded to the Pentagon’s announcement that it is investigating the Arizona lawmaker for possible breaches of military law after he joined five other Democratic members of Congress in a video calling for US troops to refuse illegal orders.</p>
<p>“I said something that was pretty simple and non controversial, and that was that members of the military should follow the law,” Kelly said in an MS NOW interview with Rachel on Monday. “And in response to that, Donald Trump said I should be executed.”</p>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>“Affordability” — it’s a hot-button issue across the political spectrum. But how does one define or quantify a subjective idea? We called up a linguist and a few economists to hear their thoughts. Plus: Flat wholesale inflation is a warning sign for higher overall inflation, September retail sales merely inched up, and the U.S. dollar is showing signs of recovery after a troubling first half of the year.</p>

<p>Like a startled turkey flapping in zigzags, the US president’s speech ricocheted bafflingly from topic to topic. He told jokes in the worst possible taste and watched them arc through the Rose Garden sky before landing with a thud. And on a day intended for charity and good cheer, he described a state governor as “a big, fat slob”.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/11/campbells-to-drop-soup-from-company-name-after-102-years">Campbell’s Soup Company</a> executive has been put on temporary leave after he allegedly referred to the firm’s offerings as “shit for fucking poor people” – a remark purportedly caught on an audio recording and attributed to him in a former employee’s wrongful termination lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Wayne county circuit court in Michigan by Robert Garza, who had joined Campbell’s New Jersey headquarters remotely in September 2024 as a security analyst. Garza alleges he was fired in January after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-president of information technology – including referring to one of the company’s ingredients as “bioengineered meat” while going off on a racist tirade.</p>

      <p>Senator hits back at Trump administration after Pentagon launches investigation for possible breaches of military law</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly said it was “non-controversial” for him and other congressional Democrats to implore military personnel to disobey “illegal orders” from the Trump administration – hitting back at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/pentagon-investigation-mark-kelly-arizona">accusations</a> of “serious allegations of misconduct” leveled against him by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>“I said something that was pretty simple and non-controversial – and that was that members of the military should follow the law,” the Arizona Democrat senator, a former US navy officer and astronaut who flew on four separate space shuttle missions between 2001 and 2011, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A3kC2h2Bu8">told</a> MS Now on Monday night.</p>

      <h1>JD Vance exploited a brawl to paint Cincinnati as crime-ridden. The fallout has divided the city</h1>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>National spotlight, after video of violent fight went viral, has led residents to question just how safe their city is or isn’t – and who is responsible for sparking the debate</p>
<p>It took only a few days for footage of a violent brawl in downtown Cincinnati in July to catch the attention of some of the country’s most high-profile figures.</p>
<p>The fight, which saw a white woman punched in the face from behind by an African American man, among other incidents, took place when around 150,000 people were attending events in the city’s urban core.</p>

<p>Television cameras caught Moehrig <a href="https://x.com/Jordan_Woodson/status/1993169475777282291">delivering a punch to Jennings’ groin</a> late in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/24/49ers-panthers-monday-night-football">49ers’ 20-9 victory</a>. Jennings did not immediately retaliate but once the game was over he approached Moehrig and hit him in the helmet before giving him a shove. Jennings then needed to be held back as the teams left the field.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed">threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James</a> yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.</p>
<p><strong>What did the judge say?</strong> “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>When did the talks begin?</strong> Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.</p>

They're accusing Binance of knowingly enabling terrorist groups like Hamas to move more than $1 billion through its platform. Also: a slowdown at Serbia's Russian-owned oil refinery, growing risks to European undersea cables, and rerouted flights after an Ethiopian volcano eruption.</p>

<p>More than three dozen universities including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Duke have their participation in a federal research partnership on the chopping block after the state department proposed to suspend them over their diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices.</p>
<p>Last week, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/universities-state-department-dei-research-program">obtained an internal memo and spreadsheet</a> showing that the state department is moving to exclude 38 institutions from the Diplomacy Lab program, which pairs university researchers with state department policy offices on foreign policy projects. The suspensions would take effect on 1 January, and because the list is not finalized, the school’s have not yet been informed.</p>

<p>Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us. I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter,” he added.</p>

      <h1>Are more Americans working multiple jobs?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>The delayed-by-the-shutdown September jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected monthly gain of 119,000 jobs, seasonally adjusted. But dig into the data, and signs point to many of those jobs being second or third jobs. In this episode, more people are working multiple gigs to get by. Plus: China’s got a different AI investment approach than the U.S., the housing market got a boost in October, and your online return probably ended up on the secondary market.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>President’s comment implies hostility to Venezuela may be based on unfounded election-rigging conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to endorse the discredited conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s leadership controls electronic voting software worldwide and caused his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>White House officials have previously said that Trump’s increasingly bellicose policy toward Venezuela is driven by concerns about migration and the drug trade. But the president’s new comment, made on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115600167812342707">Truth Social</a>, hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.</p>

<p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> are searching for the body of a man who was swept into the ocean at a beach in the Big Sur area, one week after a girl and her father died after being pulled into the water in the same state park.</p>
<p>Three people were pulled into the water from the rocks at the Soberanes Point area of Garrapata state park on Saturday afternoon just after 3pm and began yelling for help, according to a statement from the Monterey county sheriff’s office. Two women who had been dragged into the ocean were able to pull themselves out of the water.</p>

      <p>The U.S. economy is often buoyed by consumer spending. In China, however, consumer spending is a much smaller part of economic output. And while the government there tries to stimulate spending, young people there are grappling with high unemployment and stalling wage growth. Plus, we'll discuss expectations for inflation and economic growth, as well as consumer shopping figures for this upcoming Black Friday.</p>

<p>So it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all.</p>
<p>It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.</p>

      <p>US has used claims of a ‘war on drugs’ to justify its attacks, which have resulted in 83 deaths that the UN has called extrajudicial executions</p>
<p>Amid growing tensions between Washington and Caracas, the US has gathered its largest military presence in the Caribbean since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/venezuela-panama-invasion-trump">the 1989 invasion of Panama</a>.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s administration has steadily increased pressure on Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of running the “Cartel of the Suns” drug-trafficking organization, and placing a $50m bounty on his head.</p>

<p>Trump invoked the phrase “piggy” – a term he has used before – to describe a female reporter on Friday, and has aggressively responded to at least one other female reporter over the past week, including threatening to revoke ABC’s license.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Americans don’t often have a direct say in how their tax dollars get spent; those decisions are generally left to elected officials. But some places have engaged in “participatory budgeting,” where residents propose projects, then vote on which ones get public funding. Today, we head to Nashville to learn how the process played out. But first: economics at the center of G20 discussions and what Thanksgiving travel plans are looking like.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season</p>
<p>As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second">to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri</a> from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.</p>
<p>Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.</p>

      <p>Mark Kelly, a veteran targeted by Trump over military comments, says he is ‘not going to be intimidated’. Plus, DNA reveals stone age teenager as chewer of 10,500-year-old ‘gum’</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.</p>
<p><strong>What did Kelly say?</strong> “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.</p>
<p><strong>What does the original plan say?</strong> The original <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy">28-point US document</a> leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.</p>

      <h1>Trump DoJ’s focus on Maga goals harms other investigations, experts warn</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.</p>
<p>Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources. By contrast, the department last year employed about 10,000 attorneys, according to DoJ data.</p>

      <h1>Doctors respond to ‘data-free’ decision over menopause hormone therapy: ‘It’s not true’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits</p>
<p>Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.</p>
<p>The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.</p>

      <h1>‘Friends end up blocking you’: Northwestern Mutual sold college grads a dream job. They left in ruin and debt</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their contacts</p>
<p>Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine, <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/who-we-are/">describes</a> its financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.</p>
<p>It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent graduates themselves.</p>

Here's why those at Matawa First Nations Management and the KI Family Law program say they're concerned, and why they want to see more long-term, sustainable funding agreements with the government.</p>

      <h1>AI-generated "letters to the editor" are flooding academic publications</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.</p>
<p>The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.</p>
<p>They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &quot;prolific debutantes&quot; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.</p>
<p>Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</p>

      <h1>Tom Brady’s part-time side hustle with the Raiders is an unholy mess</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>The most successful quarterback of all-time approached his playing career with ruthless focus. He could do with the same intensity in his retirement projects</p>
<p>Tom Brady played for 23 NFL seasons with a single, maniacal goal: to become the greatest quarterback who ever lived. He achieved it. Now, in retirement, Brady has dabbled in everything. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/18/tom-bradys-raiders-coaching-booth-fox">calls games for Fox</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/20/birmingham-city-unveil-62000-capacity-stadium-plans-12-chimney-towers">building chimneys in Birmingham</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/27/where-did-ftx-money-go">flogged crypto</a>. He’s spreading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics">America’s Game to Riyadh</a>. He has a thriving YouTube account. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/04/tom-brady-dog-clone-colossal-biotech-viagen">cloned his dog</a>. Brady’s post-playing portfolio has been diverse, or aimless, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Side hustles are one thing. But running a pro franchise is not a part-time job. Along with his other roles, Brady is also the de facto football czar of the Raiders, the most hapless team in the league.</p>

<p>At a press conference last week U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out fresh allegations against Ryan Wedding, a 44-year-old Canadian and former Olympian who has been on the FBI’s most wanted list since March.
Wedding is already accused of orchestrating multiple murders, and these new charges add to the drug and conspiracy allegations he’s facing.
We speak to Calvi Leon, a reporter at the Toronto Star who’s been covering this case extensively.

<p>A mandatory review of the Greenbelt that was to have started earlier this year has yet to begin, and critics are demanding “substantive guardrails” around the Ford government’s assessment of the protected lands.</p>

<p>Co-op programs in health-care spaces regularly enlist post-secondary students, but some are skewing younger to target high schoolers.

      <p>Democratic senators condemn Trump after he suggests ‘seditious behaviour’ be punishable ‘by death’. Key US politics stories from Sunday 23 November</p>
<p>Democratic senator Mark Kelly has said he refuses to be intimidated after US president Donald Trump accused a group of Democrats of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">“seditious behaviour punishable by death”</a> in a series of social media posts.</p>
<p>Kelly, one of several Democrats who released a message to military and intelligence personnel that they are not obligated to follow “illegal orders”, reiterated his call on Sunday, saying that Trump was “trying to intimidate us”. Kelly called on congressional Republicans to reject Trump’s threats.</p>

<p>Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the New York City mayor-elect was asked if he still considered Trump a threat to democracy. “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani replied. “I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements.”</p>

      <h1>‘I used to call him on Father’s Day’: Oakland shattered by football coach’s killing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>In a city where football is more than a sport, the gun death of John Beam has provoked an outpouring of emotion</p>
<p>Football in Oakland, California, is more than a sport. It’s a community. In many schools, coaches are like parental figures who get young people through vulnerable times, into universities and sometimes even drafted to the National Football League.</p>
<p>So when gun violence came for longtime Oakland football coach John Beam, whose mentorship had changed the lives of generations of students, the devastation reverberated around the city.</p>

<p>Michail Chkhikvishvili, a self-described cult leader who called himself “Commander Butcher”, did not look like a Hollywood vision of a contemporary terrorist, despite the bizarre, almost made-for-TV extremist actions he planned, such as having people dressed as Santa Claus hand out poison candies on the streets of New York.</p>
<p>Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.</p>

      <h1>They’re doing to America what they did to Christianity | Bill McKibben</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to America has a precedent: the Maga evangelical perversion of Jesus’s message of radical love to one of hate and aggression</p>
<p>Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings">AI video</a> of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.</p>
<p>He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">current estimate</a> of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-climate-rollbacks-heat-deaths">study</a> predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors">active collaboration</a> of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”</p>

      <h1>‘Eating Indigenously’: award-winning chef celebrates Native American cuisine in new cookbook</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>James Beard-winning chef Sean Sherman’s cookbook Turtle Island pushes readers to view food systems through an Indigenous lens</p>
<p>As a child growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the 1970s and 80s, Sean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota member and a James Beard award-winning chef, recalls pounding dried bison and mixing it with chokeberry to create a snack called wasná. He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Thíŋpsiŋla, a wild prairie turnip that’s a staple Lakota food. Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.</p>
<p>His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant <a href="https://owamni.com/">Owamni</a>, shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.</p>

Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”</p>

      <h1>China has brought millions out of poverty. The US has not – by choice</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system</p>
<p>The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than <span class="math inline">\(3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than \)</span>3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.</p>
<p>The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.</p>

<p>He says he doesn’t watch every Bulls game these days – only about half of them. That he hasn’t spoken to Giddey much since his move to Illinois. That Longley’s life in Australia, where he part-owns the Sydney Kings and Flames, takes up most of his energies rather than what is happening on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>And yet, for the past several years, almost nothing has gone right for a beach resort known and envied in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> area for its beauty, its excellent public schools, and a progressive political culture that has sought to keep the city accessible and affordable to people of all income levels.</p>

The ban, which goes into effect 12 months after the law’s passage, forbids all products that contain more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per package – a trace amount that is present in most CBD products, not just those whose primary component is THC.</p>

Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>

      <h1>Devin Haney: ‘They said I couldn’t take a punch. But I got up and I’m still here’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>A year and a half after his unstoppable rise was hijacked, the 26-year-old boxing star aims to become a three-weight champion against big-punching Brian Norman Jr</p>
<p>Rain falls in thin, needling lines over Hell’s Kitchen as Devin Haney walks into the Victory Boxing Gym. Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.</p>
<p>“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”</p>

<p>The order, signed by Justice Samuel Alito, will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map, which is favorable to Republicans, to be used in the midterm elections.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The philosopher and the sex trafficker were in contact long after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, documents reveal</p>
<p>The prominent linguist and philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.</p>
<p>Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president">had previously claimed</a> to have with the latter.</p>

      <p>The Maga star won on the Epstein files and could have founded a Republican resistance movement but is instead the latest dissenter to head for the exit</p>
<p>It has been a head-spinning 48 hours in Washington. Liberal TV host Rachel Maddow showed up at the funeral of conservative vice-president Dick Cheney. Donald <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/trump-mamdani-white-house-new-york">Trump embraced Zohran Mamdani</a>, a democratic socialist set to be the first Muslim mayor of New York, like a brother.</p>
<p>And then Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump acolyte-turned-nemesis who bested him over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, stunned the political establishment again. In what should have been her hour of triumph, the Maga star abruptly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns">announced that she was quitting</a> the House of Representatives.</p>

      <p>A pension-pot World Cup looms and with Trump in the White House and a crown prince at his back, it is now a safe space</p>
<p>It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi">state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman</a> and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.</p>
<p>Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.</p>

<p>Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.</p>

<p>Donald Trump said on Friday night he was “immediately” terminating temporary legal protections for Somali migrants living in Minnesota, further targeting a program seeking to limit deportations that his administration has already repeatedly sought to weaken.</p>
<p>Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>TJX, the parent company of off-price retailers T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, posted excellent earnings this week, while Target cut its sales forecast. “Off-price” means TJX sells excess inventory at a discount, which may be more attractive to increasingly stressed shoppers hunting for deals. Also in this episode: Political affiliation colors consumer sentiment, USDA cuts end a major revenue stream for small-scale farmers, and supply chains are unusually slow this holiday season.</p>

      <h1>‘I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>The president hosted the mayor-elect at the White House – and seemed enamoured of his fellow New Yorker</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Oval Office meeting between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> – the mayor-elect of New York City, the US president’s beloved home town – was hardly the combustible tête-à-tête many had predicted. For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together.</p>
<p>Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “ <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157">100% Communist Lunatic</a>” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In turn, Mamdani had assailed Trump as a “despot” and pledged to be the president’s “ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trumps-worst-nightmare-mamdani-targets-the-president-in-his-general-election-bid-00504123">worst nightmare</a>”.

<p>Senator Mark Kelly – whose wife, Gabrielle Giffords, narrowly survived an attempted assassination while she was in Congress in 2011 – says he is worried about “increased threats” to his family’s safety after Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">accused</a> him and other Democratic lawmakers of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH”.</p>

He continued: “I’m not going to get into my specific security arrangements, but it would be irresponsible for me not to consider that [Trump’s] words result in increased threats to myself, even to my staff, to my family.</p>

<p>The transportation department has unveiled a first crash test dummy in the US modeled specifically on female anatomy, a move officials say is meant to close decades of safety gaps in vehicle testing.</p>
<p>Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, unveiled the THOR-05F, an advanced female design for a crash-test dummy with upgraded technical specifications. According to the transportation department, the dummy will be incorporated into federal vehicle crash testing once a final rule is published.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>From marches and petitions to a constitutional amendment, a years-long campaign led to New Mexico becoming the first state in the US to offer universal childcare</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/people-in-the-us-have-you-gotten-involved-in-community-organizing-this-year">People in the US: Have you gotten involved in activism or community organizing this year?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay. Although she taught, cooked, cleaned and did the books for a small childcare center, she was earning minimum wage. A classmate at the local community college had suggested Ibarra attend the rally, and stick around afterward for a meal with Olé, a grassroots non-profit committed to organizing working-class families.</p>

      <h1>The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1</p>
<p>The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.</p>

<p>The health of Rodney Taylor, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/liberia">Liberian</a>-born man who is a double amputee and is missing three fingers on one hand, has continued to worsen after being picked up by ICE and detained at Georgia’s Stewart immigration detention center and his case has now garnered support from a US senator.</p>
<p>Taylor, who has been detained for almost a year, told the Guardian he has now been diagnosed with bone spurs in his back, causing severe pain, while the silicone lining of one of his prosthetic legs has deteriorated, causing chafing and boils.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts say files certain to contain revelations but warn disclosures could still leave critical questions unanswered</p>
<p>They are the files that America – and the world – has long waited to see: a huge cache of documents at the Department of Justice related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/judge-calls-jeffrey-epstein-most-infamous-pedophile-in-american-history-as-he-releases-transcripts/">whom a judge</a> once dubbed the “most infamous pedophile in American history”.</p>
<p>After a law passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday, those documents must now must be released to the American public and a waiting army of journalists. Just like previous Epstein caches they are certain to include damning communications between Epstein and many rich and powerful people in his social circle.</p>

<p>The two men, 21-year-old Gavin Rivers Weisenburg and 20-year-old Tanner Christopher Thomas, have been accused of plotting to take the island by force, utilizing the homeless population of Washington DC, then killing all the men on the island and “using the women and children as sex slaves”, according to an announcement by the US attorney’s office of the eastern district of Texas on Thursday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Plus Vanity Fair’s plucky decision to feature only men in its Hollywood Issue and the reporter fired after RFK Jr ‘sexting scandal’</p>
<p>We’ve all said things that didn’t come out right, and it’s my instinct – stand by for some counter-intuition! – that Donald Trump’s “quiet, piggy” admonishment of a female reporter on Air Force One this week was a very weird attempt at affection, or possibly flirtation. As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">expressed outrage</a> after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.</p>
<p><strong>What did the lawmakers say in the video?</strong> “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”</p>
<p><strong>What did the report say?</strong> A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.</p>
<p><strong>Where did it come from?</strong> The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/">Property of the People</a>, a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.</p>

      <h1>How ICE raids are disrupting D.C.'s economy</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>After months of ICE raids on the nation’s capital, some construction workers are afraid to go into Washington, D.C. for work, fearing arrest and deportation. Meanwhile, the contractors who need them are struggling to adapt. We'll check in on some of the businesses that are being most affected. But first: why markets ended yesterday on a sour note, and why the housing affordability crisis is accelerating fastest in rural areas.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan's cabinet has approved a stimulus package worth more than $130 billion. It's the first major policy initiative of the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and aims to help households and companies with measures like energy subsidies and tax cuts. Then, the global climate change conference COP30 is drawing to a close in Brazil, and so far, there’s been no agreement on key issues like the fossil fuel phaseout.</p>

<p>Three employees inside the department spoke to the Guardian, with one warning that morale has been “completely lost”, 10 months after Trump returned to the White House. All requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.</p>

<p>The embattled former police chief of Vallejo, a San Francisco Bay Area city that has attracted <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/23/how-a-deadly-police-force-ruled-a-city">national attention</a> over police violence, has said that he endured a steady procession of racist remarks from colleagues and online harassment and threats that ultimately led him to resign.</p>
<p>By the time Chief Shawny Williams tendered his resignation in 2022, he said he had received a slew of threats – at his office, at his home, and in his email inbox. Most demanded he step down. But even after resigning, the threats still came by mail to his home and a second property he owned outside the state.</p>

<p>Boosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence. Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.</p>

<p>Little went right for Josh Allen in a frustrating game Thursday night against the Houston Texans. And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.</p>
<p>Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.</p>

<p>The White House issued a full-throated defense of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s reference to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” on Thursday, claiming without evidence that the president “calls out fake news when he sees it and gets frustrated with reporters who spread false information”.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, made the remarks during a White House briefing, saying Trump was re-elected because of his bluntness and that members of the media should appreciate his willingness to answer their questions.</p>

<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has been changed to reflect the belief of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health and human services secretary, that there is a link between vaccines and autism, a view flatly contradicted by experts and scientifically validated studies.</p>

      <p>The September jobs report finally arrived after a six-week delay, showing employers added 119,000 jobs — well above expectations. The BLS also recorded an unusually strong 80% employer response rate, the highest since 2019. Improved accuracy came as a consequence of the deferred report.

      <p>Big-name drivers and cutting out the middle man a vital part of the strategy with just over 100 days to go before the 2026 season opener</p>
<p>Twelve months ago at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Cadillac were finally given the green light as Formula One’s newest entry for 2026. Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.</p>
<p>At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.</p>

      <p>Joe Biden and George W Bush attend Republican’s service, while Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are notable absentees</p>
<p>Donald Trump and JD Vance have been snubbed, by not being invited to former vice-president Dick Cheney’s funeral, taking place on Thursday, according to a White House official familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dick-cheney">Cheney</a>, the former US vice-president to George W Bush and a Republican defense hawk who became a fierce critic of the current US president, died earlier this month at the age of 84.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Gracie Hunt, the daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, is throwing her support behind Turning Point USA’s plan to stage an alternative Super Bowl half-time show, a direct counter to the NFL’s decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/bad-bunny-to-headline-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show">to feature Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LX</a>.</p>
<p>Hunt said in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s The Will Cain Show on Tuesday that she “most definitely” backs Turning Point’s counter-programming effort, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/charlie-erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-tpusa">Erika Kirk</a>, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to his <a href="https://time.com/5852446/bad-bunny-black-lives-matter/">criticism of Donald Trump</a> and US immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>Senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts has said that the next independent Department of Justice “should investigate” the private donations that have funded the construction of the new White House ballroom.</p>

<p>It's certainly not the first time U.S. President Donald Trump has insulted a female reporter, but calling Bloomberg's Catherine Lucey 'piggy' on Air Force One, then berating ABC News' Mary Bruce a few days later has raised questions about just how much journalists are expected to tolerate as they do their jobs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After a month and a half delay due to the government shutdown, we are finally getting some official economic data. It is old (from September), but it's here. The economy gained 119,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate went up for the third month in a row. What's that mean for job seekers? Plus, declining consumer sentiment doesn't translate to declining consumer spending, Walmart's quarterly results beat expectations, and international student enrollment has dipped.</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>As federal agents descend in North Carolina, businesses close as even an after-school program is targeted</p>
<p>On Central Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, Manolo’s Bakery has become a focal point for resistance to the expanded immigration raids since border patrol officers descended on the city over the weekend. The owner closed the bakery to prevent his staff from being targeted. Most of the other shops on Charlotte’s busy immigrant-centric street followed suit.</p>
<p>Dozens of people have taken up camp in the parking lot to wave signs of support for immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) has been active in the city for months as part of Donald Trump’s mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">deportation agenda</a>, but things went up a level when the border patrol arrived. Agents swiftly began buzzing through the place to make an armed show of their presence, followed at times by Charlotteans honking their horns in warning.</p>

      <h1>AI to the rescue (for now)</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Nvidia reported earnings yesterday after markets closed, and it did not disappoint. Nvidia makes 90% of all chips used in AI. Tech stocks, including Nvidia, have been carrying a lot of weight in markets, and investors had started getting a little nervous about whether the AI boom was a bubble — but Nvidia's results have been pretty reassuring. Also: stale data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Japan's tensions with China.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: US and Russian officials draft plan to end Ukraine war based on capitulation from Kyiv</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>The plan, which is likely to be viewed as ‘surrender’ by Kyiv, is facing pushback from the EU. Plus, Trump signs bill to compel release of more Epstein documents</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine">quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine</a> that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.</p>
<p><strong>Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?</strong> That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.</p>
<p><strong>What has the EU said?</strong> Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15">follow our live blog here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What will the justice department actually release?</strong> All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.</p>

<p>Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.</p>
<p>He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain</p>
<p>Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.</p>
<p>Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Wall Street was cheered last night by better-than-expected results from the chip giant Nvidia. But the AI boom continues to fuel fears of a market bubble. In the past few weeks, a growing number of the world’s leading figures in finance have suggested that AI stocks are unrealistically inflated in value. Plus, Meta says it's shutting down accounts for younger teenagers in Australia ahead of the country's social media ban for youths under 16.</p>

</ul>
<p>Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367">10 million people to lose their health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.</p>

<p>At the close of quintessential NWSL playoffs rife with last-minute goals and upsets, the eighth-placed underdogs Gotham FC will face second-placed Washington Spirit for the trophy. Both teams have won the NWSL Championship once before: the Spirit in 2021 and Gotham two years later. Washington are the likely favourites, but Gotham’s talent cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>As we look forward to Saturday night in San Jose, here are a few key battles that could decide the game.</p>

<p>Senior White House officials have discussed internally their preference for Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros Discovery in recent weeks, and one official has discussed potential programming changes at CNN with Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount.</p>
<p>The discussions, according to people familiar with the matter, come as Paramount portrays itself as the best bid for Warner Bros Discovery, after the company announced last month it was open to offers, because it would have an easier time getting through regulatory review.</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Grokipedia, the AI-powered encyclopedia launched by Elon Musk's xAI last month, promises to be an ideological alternative to Wikipedia. But the tool doesn't just have a different political flavor, argues Ryan McGrady, senior fellow at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>He recently wrote, for Tech Policy Press, that Grokipedia takes a more top-down approach to knowledge, one that harks back to less democratized eras.</p>
