id="court-ruling-will-help-new-mexico-stay-a-go-to-state-for-women-seeking-abortions">Court
ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking
abortions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday
struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties,
helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from
other states with bans.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney
General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state’s position as having some of
the most liberal abortion laws in the country.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and
Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal “anti-vice”
law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local
abortion ordinances.</p>
<p>But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said
state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or
regulating abortion clinics.</p>
<p>“The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the
Legislature’s authority to regulate access to and provision of
reproductive healthcare,” she wrote. “We hold the ordinances are
preempted in their entirety.”</p>
<p>New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court’s ruling
Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws
preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that
would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure
in New Mexico,” he said. “It’s enshrined in law by the recent ruling by
the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico
Legislature.”</p>
<p>New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care
a basic fundamental right in New Mexico.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take a genius to understand the statutory framework that
we have. Local governments don’t regulate health care in New Mexico. It
is up to the state,” the Albuquerque Democrat said.</p>
<p>Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the
border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the
U.S.</p>
<p>But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New
Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to
shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to
abortion.</p>
<p>In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute
that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to
abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal.</p>
<p>And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed
a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access
and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from
investigations by other states.</p>
<p>In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive
health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to
local residents and people who travel from neighboring states.</p>
<p>The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide
services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception,
cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s opinion, justices said they “strongly admonish”
Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have
allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than
$100,000 for violations of the county’s abortion ordinance.</p>
<p>The provision would have created “a private right of action and
damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct,” the
court said in its opinion.</p>
<p>Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an
Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued
on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized
the court’s decision and emphasized its limitations.</p>
<p>“Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to
enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of
their citizens,” said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of
Missouri. “We’re grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not
abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state
constitution.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in
federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act
restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion
explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its
decision solely on state provisions.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas
solicitor general and architect of that state’s strict abortion ban,
said he looked forward “to litigating these issues in other states and
bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of
the United States.”</p>

id="scarves-over-headscarves-muslim-womens-outdoors-group-tackles-snow-tubing-in-minnesota">Scarves
over headscarves, Muslim women’s outdoors group tackles snow tubing in
Minnesota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka
hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break
after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18
Celsius January morning.</p>
<p>She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a
Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities
among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great
outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs.</p>
<p>“They understand my lifestyle. I don’t have to explain myself,” said
Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose
family hails from Yemen. “My religion is everything. It’s my survival
kit.”</p>
<p>As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often
attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the
headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol
of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics,
devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in
finding accommodations for religious practices.</p>
<p>Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head
covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression,
Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group
three years ago.</p>
<p>From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown
to more than 700 members. There’s a core group for Muslim women only —
for “more sisterhood and modesty,” Habib says — as well as a group for
families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and
education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge
for many migrant communities — to health and environmental
sustainability from the perspective of Islam.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and
rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation,”
Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty
chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. “How can we be more
sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change,
especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?”</p>
<p>Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States
from Somalia as children about two decades ago.</p>
<p>They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s,
growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly
vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first
lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis
was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call
to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques.</p>
<p>Even though she feels “safe and accepted” in her hijab, Hirsi joined
the group for extra support.</p>
<p>“I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more
comfortable to participate,” she said on the tubing hill, where she had
convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever done,” Mahamud
gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister’s as
their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones.</p>
<p>The sisters said it’s important to include love for the outdoors and
physical activity in their children’s religious upbringing.</p>
<p>“Taking care of one’s health is part of our faith,” Hirsi said.</p>
<p>Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports
participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who
studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders
mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families
who might frown on it.</p>
<p>Groups like Habib’s tackle empowering women in their communities as
well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex
spaces or locations for prayer.</p>
<p>“The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to
spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty
and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be
in mixed spaces without covering up,” Habib said.</p>
<p>She appears to have tapped into a great demand.</p>
<p>“When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get
sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I’ve been looking
for for a very long time,” Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing
hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat.
“I didn’t really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already
around me.”</p>
<p>Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as
much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described “homebody” she had
largely avoided since college days.</p>
<p>“It’s a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone,” she said of
the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences
but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith.</p>
<p>“We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as
well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we’re walking,”
Mohamed added.</p>
<p>Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill,
Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up
their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the
group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago.</p>
<p>“With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through,
even with the clothing and hijabs,” Latifi said. “It feels way, way more
like, you know, where you are with family.”</p>

honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest
civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was “a light
of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.”</p>
<p>Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person
on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his
presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the
wildfires in California.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a
phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and
alleviate suffering around the world.</p>
<p>It’s the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction
during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with
distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President
Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only
time in Obama’s two terms that he awarded that version of the medal.</p>
<p>The citation for the pope says “his mission of serving the poor has
never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions
about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and
protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different
faiths.”</p>
<p>Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors
to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent
weeks.</p>

<h2 id="blue-origin-set-for-1st-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket">Blue Origin
set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff
Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a
brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space
race.</p>
<p>The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due
to “unfavorable” sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X.</p>
<p>Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first
American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters)
tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast
off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that
opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday.</p>
<p>“Pointy end up!” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside
photos of the gleaming white behemoth.</p>
<p>With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world’s second-richest man,
is taking direct aim at the world’s wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company
SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and
Falcon Heavy rockets.</p>
<p>These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA —
including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International
Space Station.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game
in town and so having a competitor… this is great,” G. Scott Hubbard, a
retired senior NASA official, told AFP.</p>
<p>SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship —
its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of
high-stakes rivalry.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt
to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor
of Bezos’ mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange
in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will
be Blue Origin’s first shot at a touchdown on the high seas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rocket’s upper stage will fire its engines toward
Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship
called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test
flight.</p>
<p>Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while
successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome “bonus.”</p>
<p>Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets —
used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on
terra firma rather than a ship at sea.</p>
<p>Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes
aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project
Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with
Starlink.</p>
<p>Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk
dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry
off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, “humanity’s
blue origin.”</p>
<p>He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX
— but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival’s “fail
fast, learn fast” philosophy.</p>
<p>“There’s been impatience within the space community over Blue
Origin’s very deliberate approach,” Scott Pace, a space policy analyst
at George Washington University and former member of the National Space
Council, told AFP.</p>
<p>If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government
“dissimilar redundancy” — valuable backup if one system fails.</p>

id="trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-from-us-justice-department">Trump
prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against
Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat
and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican
president-elect prepares to return to the White House. </p>
<p>Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a
court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking
her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final
report.  </p>
<p>Notice of Smith’s resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which
said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final
confidential report on January 7, and “separated” from the Justice
Department on January 10.  </p>
<p>A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four
criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a
halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S.
Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that
former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official
acts. Neither case went to trial. </p>
<p>After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the
November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding
Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In
asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith’s team defended the merits
of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump’s impending
return to the White House made them untenable.  </p>
<p>Smith’s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal
cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for
the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his
political comeback. </p>
<p>Smith’s resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump,
who has frequently called Smith “deranged” had said he would fire him
immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he
may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him
once he returns to office. </p>
<p>Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to
face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with
trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016
presidential campaign. Smith’s charges followed, accusing Trump of
illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of
trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6,
2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged
Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that
state. </p>
<p>Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically
motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in
campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to
drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed
against him and his supporters. </p>
<p>The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by
career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.</p>

id="winter-storm-dumps-snow-in-us-south-maintains-its-icy-grip">Winter
storm dumps snow in US South, maintains its icy grip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Flight cancellations piled up and state officials
warned of continuing dangerous roads Saturday in the wake of a winter
storm that closed schools and disrupted travel across parts of the
southern United States.</p>
<p>A storm that brought biting cold and wet snow to the South was moving
out to sea off the East Coast on Saturday, leaving behind a forecast for
snow showers in the Appalachian Mountains and New England. But
temperatures are expected to plunge after sundown Saturday in the South,
raising the risk that melting snow will freeze and turn roadways slick
with ice. </p>
<p>“I definitely don’t think everything’s going to completely melt,”
said Scott Carroll, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Atlanta,
Georgia. “Especially the secondary roads will probably still have some
slush on them.” </p>
<p>Airport tie-ups remain </p>
<p>Major roads were mostly clear, but few ventured out early Saturday.
The Atlanta Hawks postponed the pro basketball game they were supposed
to host Saturday afternoon against the Houston Rockets, citing icy
conditions. </p>
<p>Major airports including those in Atlanta and Charlotte, North
Carolina, continued to report disruptions Saturday. While flights were
operating, airlines canceled and delayed more flights after Friday’s
weather slowed airline travel to a crawl. By Saturday afternoon, about
1,000 flights in and out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Airport were canceled or delayed, according to tracking software
FlightAware. </p>
<p>Sarah Waithera Wanyoike, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn,
was starting her second day at Atlanta’s airport Saturday. Wanyoike
arrived at the world’s busiest airport before sunrise Friday to catch an
Ethiopian Airlines flight, on the way to her job in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The plane boarded after a delay Friday, but never left, discharging
passengers back to the gate after taxiing around and never taking off
for six hours. Wanyoike said her luggage remained stuck on the plane and
she dared not try to go home because she was told to be back at the gate
before dawn Saturday. </p>
<p>“People slept with their babies on the floors last night,” Wanyoike
said. </p>
<p>Delta Air Lines, the largest carrier at the Atlanta airport, said
late Friday that it was “working to recover” on Saturday, saying
cancellations would be worst among morning flights because of crews and
airplanes that weren’t where they were supposed to be after the airline
canceled 1,100 flights Friday. </p>
<p>Richmond drops boil-water advisory </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Richmond in the state of Virginia, lifted its
boil-water advisory late Saturday morning, nearly a week after Monday’s
snowstorm cut power and caused a malfunction to the city’s water
system. </p>
<p>Mayor Danny Avula said lab tests confirmed that Richmond’s water was
safe to drink, adding that boil-water advisories had been lifted for
some surrounding counties as well. </p>
<p>The temporary halting of the water system affected more than 200,000
people, some of whom lacked water in their homes because of diminished
pressure. </p>
<p>Freezing rain pushed up electricity outages above 110,000 in Georgia
on Friday night, but most power was restored Saturday. The National
Weather Service reported small amounts of ice accumulation around
Atlanta from the freezing rain. </p>
<p>Parts of mountainous western North Carolina saw as much as 4.5 inches
(about 11 centimeters) of snow in a 24-hour period that ended at 7 a.m.
Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Parts of middle Tennessee saw nearly 6 inches (about 15 centimeters)
of snow by Saturday morning. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the storm brought heavy snow and slick roads to
much of the states of Texas and Oklahoma before moving east. The states
of Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized National Guard troops for tasks
such as helping stranded motorists, and governors declared states of
emergency. </p>
<p>City starts digging out</p>
<p>Businesses and churches started digging out from under several inches
of snow that fell on Nashville, Tennessee, in order to reopen for the
weekend. </p>
<p>At Judah Temple of Praise, church members Saturday shoveled, salted
and blew snow off sidewalks and the parking lot in advance of Sunday
services. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to use the excuse of a parking lot covered in snow
to not show up and praise our God tomorrow,” said elder Myyah
Lockhart. </p>
<p>Andy Atkins, co-owner of the Bad Luck Burger Club food truck in east
Nashville, brushed off picnic tables with a broom and shoveled snow off
the sidewalk in front of his business. He closed the truck Friday but
hoped that customers would show up Saturday. </p>
<p>“Having a day off is good for the soul, but is bad for the pocket,
you know,” said Atkins. </p>
<p>Alabama schools could stay closed </p>
<p>School was canceled Friday for millions of children from Texas to
Georgia and as far east as the state of South Carolina, giving them a
rare snow day. Officials in northern Alabama on Saturday said schools
could remain closed Monday if ice doesn’t melt off secondary roads. </p>
<p>The storm piled up more than a year’s worth of snowfall on some
cities. </p>
<p>As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts of Arkansas,
and there were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25 centimeters) in
Little Rock, which averages 3.8 inches (9.7 centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis
International Airport in Tennessee. The city usually sees 2.7 inches
(6.9 centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some
spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. </p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the United States, Europe and
Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently,
paradoxically, because of a warming world.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — After ripping through thousands of buildings, wildfires
in Los Angeles were looming Saturday toward the celebrated Getty Center
and its priceless collection. </p>
<p>Nestled in the mountains above Los Angeles, the famed art museum is
within a new evacuation warning zone as the Palisades Fire roars
east. </p>
<p>Dubbed a “beautiful fortress” and constructed of fire-resistant
travertine stone, as well as cement and steel, the center has drawn
museum experts from around the world to observe its safety system. </p>
<p>Its roofs are covered with crushed stone to prevent embers from
igniting; in the gardens, resilient plants were chosen. </p>
<p>Inside, the galleries can be closed off with a vaultlike double door
that, museum officials say, is practically impenetrable. </p>
<p>“Getty staff, the art collections and buildings remain safe from the
Palisades fire,” the museum said Friday, hours before the evacuation
warning. </p>
<p>“The threat is still happening,” Getty added in an X post. </p>
<p>The museum’s unique collection comprises 125,000 artworks — including
paintings by Rembrandt, Turner, Van Gogh and Monet — and 1.4 million
documents. It also houses a research hub and a foundation. </p>
<p>Museum officials have previously said the collection is protected
within the center’s fireproof structure, made up of 300,000 travertine
blocks and 12,500 tons of steel bars. </p>
<p>“The Getty was constructed to house valuable art and keep it very
safe from fires, from earthquakes, from any type of damage,” said Lisa
Lapin, communications vice president now and when Getty was threatened
by fire in 2019. </p>
<p>“We are really built like a beautiful fortress, and everything inside
is quite safe,” she told AFP at the time. </p>
<p>Built more than two decades ago by architect Richard Meier at a cost
of $1 billion, the center’s protective measures also include a
3.8-million liter water tank feeding its irrigation system. </p>
<p>The building’s ventilation system has an internal recycling system,
similar to those found in cars, preventing smoke from entering rooms
from the outside. </p>
<p>Despite such extensive measures, Getty announced its closure earlier
this week “out of caution and to help alleviate traffic.” </p>
<p>When the 2019 fire threatened the center, it served as a base for
firefighters battling the blaze.  </p>
<p>Caused by a tree branch falling on power lines, that fire burned 300
hectares and destroyed 10 homes. </p>
<p>A fire two years before that also triggered safety measures at Getty,
although it affected only the far side of an adjacent freeway. </p>
<p>“In both cases, we’ve been very confident that the center is fine,”
said Lapin in 2019. </p>
<p>The Palisades fire has ravaged nearly 9,000 hectares since erupting
on Tuesday and is just 11% contained as a series of fires burn through
Los Angeles neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The fire threatened the separate Getty Villa, which also has special
flame-resistant protections, earlier in the week. </p>
<p>Trees and vegetation around the coastal villa were burned, but the
structure and collections, including Greek and Roman antiquities, were
spared.</p>

<h2 id="death-toll-from-los-angeles-wildfires-hits-16">Death toll from
Los Angeles wildfires hits 16</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office
Saturday evening said the confirmed death toll from the area’s wildfires
has risen to 16, up from the previous confirmed 11.</p>
<p>Five of the new total were from the Palisades Fire and 11 from the
Eaton Fire, according to the coroner’s office statement.</p>
<p>Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most
destructive fire burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and
grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes
are forecast to return.</p>
<p>“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz
told reporters at a Saturday briefing.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday
night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112
kph.</p>
<p>The toll stood Saturday at 11 people killed, at least 13 missing and
more than 12,000 structures destroyed. Officials have warned that the
death toll could increase.</p>
<p>Planes and helicopters worked together Saturday in an aerial assault,
dropping water to aid the firefighters working on the ground in
Mandeville Canyon and to keep the Palisades Fire from continuing to
spread, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The shift of the Palisades Fire, the largest of five, prompted
evacuation orders, including the Brentwood and Encino neighborhoods and
the foothills of the San Fernando Valley. The fire is threatening the J.
Paul Getty Museum and University of California, Los Angeles campus. If
it jumps Interstate 405, the densely populated Hollywood Hills and San
Fernando Valley would be in danger.</p>
<p>Cal Fire official Todd Hopkins told reporters Saturday that 11% of
the Palisades Fire is contained. The second-largest blaze, the Eaton
fire, was 15% contained, according to the department.</p>
<p>The Palisades and Eaton fires already rank as the most destructive in
Los Angeles history. Together, they have burned through about 145 square
kilometers of land and destroyed or damaged about 12,000 structures.</p>
<p>Cal Fire is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area:
the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Kenneth fires. As of Saturday,
the Kenneth fire was 80% contained, the Hurst fire was 7% contained, and
the Lidia fire was 100% contained, according to the Times.</p>
<p>Even as the fires are being fought, investigations have begun. Chief
among them is why the Santa Ynez Reservoir in the Palisades was empty
and closed for repairs, according to the Times, and why fire hydrants
did not have water.</p>
<p>“When a firefighter comes up to a hydrant, we expect there’s going to
be water,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said, faulting city
leadership and citing budget cuts.</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a “full independent review”
of the city’s utilities Friday, saying in an open letter the lack of
water supplies during the initial fires was “deeply troubling” and that
answers were needed to learn “to how that happened.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden spoke by phone Saturday with Los Angeles County
Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and Ventura County Supervisor Kelly Long to
discuss the latest updates on the wildfires across Los Angeles, a White
House statement said.</p>
<p>Biden convened key officials Friday to discuss the federal
government’s response to the wildfires. On Thursday, he said federal
resources and additional funding were made available to California. The
money will be used to cover all the costs for 180 days, including
temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials, first responder
salaries, and measures to protect life.</p>
<p>“We have an awful lot of experience with this stuff, unfortunately,”
Biden told reporters Friday. “Climate change has been real. It’s been
real for the last four years of our administration. We’ve seen
devastating impacts.”</p>
<p>Biden added that his administration was coordinating with the
incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has faulted Biden and Newsom for the crisis. “He is the blame
for this,” Trump wrote about Newsom on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump said California’s water policies are to blame for the fires in
the Los Angeles area, which is experiencing extremely dry conditions and
fierce Santa Ana winds. Trump demanded that Newsom “open up the water
main” in Northern California to send water south, but there is no such
central water valve in the state.</p>
<p>Some residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on
Friday. Officials urged them not to search through the rubble, which
could contain lead, arsenic, and asbestos. After damage teams evaluate
the properties, residents will be able to return in protective gear.</p>
<p>In some neighborhoods, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said,
teams are conducting grid searches with cadaver dogs.</p>
<p>Various estimates say the fires burning in the Los Angeles area are
likely to be the costliest ever. AccuWeather put the toll at between
$135 billion and $150 billion.</p>
<p>“This will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and
also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because
of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles
with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,” said
Jonathan Porter, the private firm’s chief meteorologist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, California’s insurance commissioner blocked insurance
companies from canceling or not renewing the policies of customers in
the areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires for a one-year period.
Concerns have increased that this week’s fires could hasten the flow of
insurers out of California.</p>

<h2 id="trump-envoy-meets-with-netanyahu-amid-ceasefire-push">Trump
envoy meets with Netanyahu amid ceasefire push</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM/CAIRO — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East
envoy Steve Witkoff met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Saturday amid a push to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, Netanyahu’s office
said.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Netanyahu dispatched a high-level delegation,
which included the head of the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency, to
Qatar to “advance” talks to return hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza,
a statement from Netanyahu’s office said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, an Israeli official said some progress had been
made in the indirect talks between Israel and Palestinian militant group
Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, to reach a deal
in Gaza.</p>
<p>The mediators are making renewed efforts to reach a deal to halt the
fighting in the enclave and free the remaining Israeli hostages held
there before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. A deal would also involve
the release of some Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.</p>
<p>Families of Israeli hostages welcomed Netanyahu’s decision to
dispatch the officials, with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum
Headquarters describing it as a “historic opportunity.”</p>
<p>Witkoff arrived in Doha on Friday and met Qatari Prime Minister
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry
said.</p>
<p>Egyptian and Qatari mediators received reassurances from Witkoff that
the U.S. would continue to work toward a fair deal to end the war soon,
Egyptian security sources said, although he did not give any
details.</p>
<p>Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed
across its borders in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more
than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza,
according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid
to waste and gripped by a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Attacks in Gaza</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Palestinian civil emergency service said eight
people were killed, including two women and two children, in an Israeli
airstrike on a former school sheltering displaced families in Jabalia,
in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said that the strike targeted Hamas militants
who were operating at the school and that it had taken measures to
reduce the risk of harm to civilians.</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, the Gaza Civil Emergency Service said five people
were killed and several others were wounded in two Israeli strikes. One
of the two strikes killed three people in a house near the Daraj
neighborhood in Gaza City.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas militant “in that area”
at that approximate time.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Los Angeles has a long way to go before city and state officials can
start looking for lessons to take from them that can help prevent future
fires. Likely topics of discussion will include building resilient
structures,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-controlled-burns" target="_self"><u>vegetation
management</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>community
preparedness</u></a>. But there are also some more out of the box
solutions coming from a growing number of technology companies —
“firetech” startups, if you will — that are putting new, high-tech spins
on some of these familiar strategies.
</p>
<p>
BurnBot, for instance, makes a remotely operated machine that executes
efficient controlled burns to help mitigate wildfire risk. “I don’t
think you can ever replace the talent and the expertise and the know-how
of the front line [firefighters],” Anukool Lakhina, CEO of BurnBot, told
me this week. “But what you can do is make their job safer.”
</p>
<p>
Last August
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>I
wrote about Convective Capital</u></a>, the venture capital firm
exclusively focused on funding wildfire solutions, and one of its
portfolio companies, Rhizome, which makes an AI-powered wildfire risk
mitigation platform for utilities. Here are five more notable companies
in Convective’s portfolio that will hopefully help bring wildfire
prevention and mitigation into the future.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gridware
</h3>
<p>
On January 8, as flames began to encircle Los Angeles, Gridware
announced its $26.4 million Series A funding round. The company uses
sensors placed on power poles to provide continuous monitoring of grid
infrastructure and can alert grid operators to hazards and faults in
realtime. This allows for rapid repairs and immediate response to
wildfire threats such as equipment failure, downed lines, or any contact
with vegetation. And because Gridware’s devices operate on solar power,
they can remain online even during a power outage.
</p>
<p>
“Our country depends on the electric grid, yet until now, utilities have
been operating it without reasonable monitoring capabilities,” said
Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which led Gridware’s
Series A, in a statement about the funding round. Utility-caused
wildfires tend to be particularly damaging, as they often occur near
populated areas. And though California utilities spend over $6 million
annually on risk mitigation, most of that goes towards older
technologies, something Gridware hopes to change.
</p>
<p>
Gridware implemented a
<a href="https://www.pge.com/en/newsroom/currents/safety/articles-4038-pge-responding-dynamic-wildfire-risk-sense-urgency.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>successful
pilot</u></a> with PG&amp;E last year, and has since expanded to
monitoring over 1,000 miles of power lines for 18 different customers,
with devices installed on about 10,000 poles.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>BurnBot
</h3>
<p>
As mentioned above,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_iuAT2oxqE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BurnBot
deploys robots </u></a>that can chop up vegetation and conduct
controlled burns in a wide variety of geographies, from densely treed
forests to shrubbery near urban environments. Traditionally, controlled
burns are only safe to do in very particular weather conditions, but
because BurnBot captures the smoke from its operations and immediately
extinguishes the fires after vegetation is removed, Lakhina told me the
robots can operate in all weather.
</p>
<p>
“Today, a lot of the predominant way that fuel treatment is done,
regrettably, is extremely archaic. It’s humans with matches setting
things on fire, or humans with shovels and spades that go and dig the
vegetation.” Some estimates calculate that the U.S. has about 200
million acres of land that need to be treated for wildfire risk, and
“you’re not going to get there relying only on humans or only on
grazing,” Lakhina said. He estimates that the company’s robots can treat
40 times the area of a typical hand crew.
</p>
<p>
BurnBot has piloted its tech with
<a href="https://abc7.com/post/california-wildfires-cal-fire-pge-test-rx2-burnbot-martinez-controlled-burn-machine-could-help-reduce-risk/15286640/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CalFire,

million Series A</u></a> funding round last year.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Fire Aside
</h3>
<p>
Fire Aside makes software products that help fire departments and other
safety agencies to digitize their inspections processes, thereby
ensuring that homes and businesses are complying with fire safety
requirements and helping to scale state and community wildfire
prevention programs.
</p>
<p>
“It enhances the reach of municipal fire departments so that they can,
at scale, communicate with their neighborhoods and their communities,
and automate and digitize these inspections,” Jay Ribakove, principal at
Convective Capital, told me. That’s certainly a step up from the
traditional method, which involves “a firefighter showing up and leaving
you with some handwritten notes on what you can do better,” Ribakove
said. Residents in communities that use Fire Aside are five times more
likely to take actions to protect their property against wildfire, the
company says.
</p>
<p>
Fire Aside raised a seed round of undisclosed size in 2023, led by
Convective Capital.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Pano
</h3>
<p>
Early fire detection is one of the most critical factors in keeping
blazes under control. Pano is a software company that relies on
artificial intelligence and computer vision to automatically detect when
and where a wildfire is breaking out. The company mounts its cameras on
telecommunications towers, poles, or other equipment, which, combined
with other inputs like satellite data, field sensors, and emergency
alerts, gives fire professionals and first responders a unified view of
any developing situation.
</p>
<p>
“The sooner that we can detect fires, the faster we can respond,”
Ribakove told me,
<a href="https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=the-economic-fiscal-and-environmental-costs-of-wildfires-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>citing
research</u></a> that indicates that if wildfire response times in
California were just 15 minutes quicker, the frequency of large,
out-of-control fires could be reduced by at least 3% and as much as 7%.
Given that California has experienced, on average, $117 billion in total
annual economic losses from wildfires from 2017 to 2021, tech like
Pano’s could save it as much as $8.2 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
Pano raised a $20 million Series A round in 2022 and a $17 million
growth round in 2023.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Overstory
</h3>
<p>
Overstory has another approach to minimizing the presence of fire fuels,
providing utilities with a “global vegetation management platform” that
applies artificial intelligence to satellite imagery, allowing the
company to identify the location, size, health, and species of any tree
in the world. With this date, Overstory can then give utilities risk
analyses, identify particular areas where vegetation might pose a
wildfire risk, such as by growing too close to a power line, and
recommend specific actions. Overstory also hopes its tech will save
utilities money, as vegetation management budgets have ballooned in
recent years.
</p>
<p>
Overstory works with more than 40 utilities, including PG&amp;E, along
with others in Canada, Brazil, and Europe. At the time of its $14
million Series A round, in 2023, the company said that it monitored
about 2 million acres and protected about $6 billion in utility assets.

prevention programs.
</p>
<p>
“It enhances the reach of municipal fire departments so that they can,
at scale, communicate with their neighborhoods and their communities,
and automate and digitize these inspections,” Jay Ribakove, principal at
Convective Capital, told me. That’s certainly a step up from the
traditional method, which involves “a firefighter showing up and leaving
you with some handwritten notes on what you can do better,” Ribakove
said. Residents in communities that use Fire Aside are five times more
likely to take actions to protect their property against wildfire, the
company says.
</p>
<p>
Fire Aside raised a seed round of undisclosed size in 2023, led by
Convective Capital.

<li>Pano
</h3>
<p>
Early fire detection is one of the most critical factors in keeping
blazes under control. Pano is a software company that relies on
artificial intelligence and computer vision to automatically detect when
and where a wildfire is breaking out. The company mounts its cameras on
telecommunications towers, poles, or other equipment, which, combined
with other inputs like satellite data, field sensors, and emergency
alerts, gives fire professionals and first responders a unified view of
any developing situation.
</p>
<p>
“The sooner that we can detect fires, the faster we can respond,”
Ribakove told me,
<a href="https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=the-economic-fiscal-and-environmental-costs-of-wildfires-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>citing
research</u></a> that indicates that if wildfire response times in
California were just 15 minutes quicker, the frequency of large,
out-of-control fires could be reduced by at least 3% and as much as 7%.
Given that California has experienced, on average, $117 billion in total
annual economic losses from wildfires from 2017 to 2021, tech like
Pano’s could save it as much as $8.2 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
Pano raised a $20 million Series A round in 2022 and a $17 million
growth round in 2023.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Overstory
</h3>
<p>
Overstory has another approach to minimizing the presence of fire fuels,
providing utilities with a “global vegetation management platform” that
applies artificial intelligence to satellite imagery, allowing the
company to identify the location, size, health, and species of any tree
in the world. With this data, Overstory can then help utilities identify
particular areas where vegetation might pose a wildfire risk, such as by
growing too close to a power line, and recommend specific actions.
Overstory also hopes its tech will save utilities money, as vegetation
management budgets have ballooned in recent years.
</p>
<p>
Overstory works with more than 40 utilities, including PG&amp;E, along
with others in Canada, Brazil, and Europe. At the time of its $14
million Series A round, in 2023, the company said that it monitored
about 2 million acres and protected about $6 billion in utility assets.

‘notorious markets’ report warns of risks from online pharmacies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — Nearly all of the world’s 35,000 online pharmacies are
being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective
or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s annual
report on “notorious markets.” The report also singled out 19 countries
over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.</p>
<p>The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of
them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in
selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.</p>
<p>The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating
the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without
prescriptions and safety warnings.</p>
<p>Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often
with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of
buying prescription medicines from such sources.</p>
<p>It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies’ Global
Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online
pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful
medicines.</p>
<p>Last year, federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal
drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had
packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as
common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online
drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died
of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming
the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.</p>
<p>Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert
ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are
sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not
give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been
harmed.</p>
<p>Progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods</p>
<p>The USTR’s annual report cited examples from inside the United
States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including
fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based
outside the U.S.</p>
<p>The “Notorious Markets List” did laud progress in fighting
counterfeit and pirated goods.</p>
<p>In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police
collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring,
Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.</p>
<p>The report said the world’s then-largest pirated movies site had
drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.</p>
<p>In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate
television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines
and forfeit property.</p>
<p>The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the
United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and
shoes in Kuwait.</p>
<p>But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict
piracy of movies and other content and of so-called “bulletproof”
internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them
leeway for using pirate sites, it said.</p>
<p>One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly
lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.</p>
<p>Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China’s largest search
engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or
being slow to act on copyright protection.</p>
<p>The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to
Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance.
It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but
that they still host many counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce
site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and
South American had better track records in fighting piracy than
others.</p>
<p>IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still
offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.</p>
<p>While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved
online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for
selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in
the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam’s Ho
Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>The report said Bangkok’s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000
stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such
products still can be found there.</p>

id="college-tuition-has-fallen-significantly-at-many-us-schools-research-finds">College
tuition has fallen significantly at many US schools, research finds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>boston — The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right? </p>
<p>Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying
significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade
ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after
years of hefty rises. </p>
<p>Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average
student attending an in-state public university this year faces a
tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when
taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the
average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid.
That’s down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually,
according to the data. </p>
<p>That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students
attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt,
down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures.
And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by
17%, to $27,100. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a
much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking
inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College
Board. That’s a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition
increased 68%. </p>
<p>Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth
the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about
the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates
heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according
to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<p>Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off.
Americans with a bachelor’s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during
their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma,
according to research from Georgetown University’s Center on Education
and the Workforce. </p>
<p>COVID effect</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions,
said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board
and lead author of the study. </p>
<p>“We know that during COVID, a lot of institutions — public and
private — froze tuition,” Ma said. </p>
<p>As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma
said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to
reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired,
however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly
used up by the end of 2022. </p>
<p>Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson’s decision to attend
Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000
annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships
bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old
senior from Nevada. </p>
<p>“I originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it
came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the
best option,” said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works
as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school. </p>
<p>Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue
University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state
tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years. </p>
<p>Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and
Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data. </p>
<p>“Institutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states’
efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal
investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and
enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,” Becker said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have
fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College
Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by
the National Center for Education Statistics. </p>
<p>Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state
public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting — as
much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions
offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and
lower-income students. </p>
<p>Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid,
including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November
announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no
longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall. </p>
<p>Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in
an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of
young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant
loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational
costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the
pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under
control.</p>

id="biden-team-urges-trump-administration-to-keep-continuity-in-indo-pacific">Biden
team urges Trump administration to keep continuity in Indo-Pacific</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — Jake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security
adviser, is urging the incoming Trump administration to continue
President Joe Biden’s strategy of bolstering ties with allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter adversaries that include China
and North Korea.</p>
<p>“The case we will make to them is that the American position in the
region is incredibly strong right now,” Sullivan said in response to
VOA’s question during a roundtable with journalists on Friday.</p>
<p>“There should be more continuity than significant change with respect
to our Indo-Pacific strategy,” he said. “But I don’t know what the
incoming team will actually end up doing.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, considered one of the main architects of the Biden
administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy, said the president’s approach is
“working in a big way,” and he warned that straying from that will
“bring risk.”</p>
<p>Sullivan acknowledged, however, that the administration failed to
make substantial progress on denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>As the threat from Pyongyang remains as acute as it has ever been,
Sullivan highlighted key distinctions: closer cooperation between North
Korea and Russia and a “broader alignment of competitors and adversaries
— Russia, China, North Korea, Iran.”</p>
<p>He repeated the administration’s warning against reducing U.S.
support for Kyiv, something that President-elect Donald Trump has
signaled he would do. What happens in Ukraine really matters for the
Indo-Pacific, Sullivan said, because “China’s watching.”</p>
<p>Biden’s aides have often voiced concern that the West’s reluctance to
bolster Kyiv’s defenses could embolden China to follow Russia’s lead and
invade its smaller democratic neighbor, Taiwan, or act even more
aggressively on its disputed territorial claims in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>Bonnie Glaser, managing director of German Marshall Fund’s
Indo-Pacific Program, said that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang
has developed quickly, with North Korea sending its troops to support
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and is likely to expand.</p>
<p>“We have yet to see what weapons systems or military technologies
Putin has promised to deliver to Kim,” she told VOA, referring to
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“Beijing has refused to apply leverage to stop this trend.”</p>
<p>Sullivan expressed confidence that the administration has “set up a
great opportunity for the next team” to enhance the U.S. position and
has “shifted the balance of power” in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>He outlined Biden’s approach of creating a network of alliances and
partnerships, including enhancing cooperation with the Quad, an informal
grouping with India, Australia and Japan, as well as rolling out the
AUKUS security deal with the United Kingdom and Australia to provide
Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines to better patrol the waters of
the region.</p>
<p>Sullivan also highlighted trilateral cooperation among the U.S.,
Japan and South Korea, with the two former adversaries now working
together to deter North Korea’s nuclear threat, and among the U.S.,
Japan and the Philippines to push back against Beijing’s aggression in
the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Continuity or change</p>
<p>Because relations between Washington and Beijing will likely remain
adversarial, the region could see more continuity on U.S. policy toward
China under the incoming administration.</p>
<p>Trump has selected two well-known China hawks for key roles in his
“America First” Cabinet: Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary
of state, and Representative Mike Waltz, the man Trump is eyeing to
become Sullivan’s successor.</p>
<p>However, Waltz earlier this week announced a sweeping directive to
terminate all national security staffers loaned from other departments
and agencies who serve in apolitical, nonpartisan senior staff roles.
Waltz said the firings were meant to enforce absolute alignment with
Trump’s policy agenda.</p>
<p>Aside from staffing the National Security Council with Trump
loyalists, it’s unclear whether the president-elect will employ the same
approach of leveraging alliances to deter China.</p>
<p>The first Trump administration saw that “multilateral alliances are
more a burden than a reality,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During his first
term, Trump terminated U.S. membership in organizations and agreements
that included the Paris Climate Accord, the U.N. Human Rights Council
and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>“If you do form alliances, they’re going to have to be based on
clear, specific, quid pro quo transactions,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump also focused more on bilateral ties, and
he may fall back on that approach.</p>
<p>“He might emphasize ties with strong conservative leaders like [Prime
Minister Narendra] Modi in India but de-emphasize groups like the
U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilat[eral], particularly if a new government in
Seoul drifts a little away from Washington,” said Zack Cooper, senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>“What remains unclear is whether Trump will be confrontational with
China outside the economic arena,” Cooper told VOA. Key uncertainties
include whether the U.S. will pursue a less robust response to Beijing’s
moves in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“Trump personally seems more open to engagement with [Chinese
President] Xi Jinping and focused on trade issues, but many in his
administration will be pushing for a hard line on security and
technology issues,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>Change of trade strategy</p>
<p>Trade is one area where analysts expect a significant change in
strategy as Trump appears set to enact protectionist measures,
threatening to wield tariffs as a weapon of punishment not only on
adversaries but also on regional partners, particularly those with large
trade surpluses, including Japan.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to undo the Biden’s administration’s effort to
revitalize trade with the region. During his presidential campaign,
Trump vowed to kill the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, Biden’s 2022
deal with countries in the region, saying that it will hurt American
manufacturing and workers.</p>
<p>IPEF was Biden’s attempt to bolster economic ties with Indo-Pacific
countries five years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama
administration’s most important trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, immediately upon entering his first term.</p>
<p>The framework pursues nontrade priorities such as supply chain
resilience, secure digital infrastructure and sustainable clean energy
transition. It has been criticized by many in the region for not
offering market access measures as Beijing aggressively expanded its
economic clout, including through the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership, the world’s largest regional free-trade pact that covers
almost one-third of the world’s population and GDP.</p>

id="prosecutors-demand-former-us-senator-get-at-least-15-years-in-prison-for-corruption">Prosecutors
demand former US senator get at least 15 years in prison for
corruption</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prosecutors are demanding that former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez be
given at least a 15-year prison sentence following his conviction for
corruption that included acting as an agent of a foreign government.</p>
<p>In the sentencing recommendation filed late Thursday in a Manhattan
federal court, prosecutors said the 71-year-old Democrat who once
represented New Jersey is the first senator convicted of abusing a
Senate committee leadership position and the first person convicted of
serving as a foreign agent while being a public official. This
“historical rarity,” they said, was a “grave abuse of his power.”</p>
<p>Menendez’s lawyers say their client has suffered enough and have
called for leniency, citing federal guidelines that would have him
serving less than 27 months. Meanwhile, probation officers said their
guidelines would have the senator serving from 24½ to 30½ years.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said arguments that Menendez has been punished enough
reflect a “deeply misplaced sense of entitlement.”</p>
<p>He is scheduled to be sentenced on January 29.</p>
<p>Menendez was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
when he was charged in 2023 but was forced out of that position and
relinquished his Senate seat in August. He had been a senator for 18½
years.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in their court submissions that Menendez had, in
multiple instances, promoted the Egyptian government’s viewpoints and
assisted the Egyptian government in ways “directly adverse to his own
fellow U.S. Senators” as he sought to adjust his own public criticism of
Egypt.</p>
<p>Menendez was convicted in July of 16 counts of corruption. An FBI
raid on his home in 2022 uncovered at least $150,000 in gold bars,
$480,000 in cash and a Mercedes-Benz. A large portion of the cash,
prosecutors said, was the result of bribes from three New Jersey
businessmen. The men had sought the senator’s protection and influence
in schemes that included giving one of them, Wael Hana, the sole right
to certify that U.S. meat exported to Egypt adhered to Islamic dietary
requirements, forcing out other companies that had been certifying the
exportations.</p>
<p>Two of the businessmen — Hana and Fred Daibes — were convicted with
Menendez. Prosecutors have called for them to spend 10 and nine years in
prison, respectively. The third man pleaded guilty and testified at the
trial.</p>
<p>Menendez’s wife, Nadine Menendez, who is facing many of the same
charges as her husband, has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled
to begin next month. It was delayed last year after a breast cancer
diagnosis required surgery.</p>

Press.</p>

id="judge-holds-giuliani-in-contempt-for-continued-lies-about-election-workers">Judge
holds Giuliani in contempt for continued lies about election
workers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Rudy Giuliani was found in contempt of court Friday for
the second time in a week, as a federal judge warned Giuliani he could
be sent to jail if he doesn’t stop spreading lies about two former
Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment
against him.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington found that the former
New York City mayor and former attorney for President-elect Donald Trump
violated court orders barring him from defaming Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and
her mother, Ruby Freeman. The judge ordered him to review trial
testimony and other materials from the case and warned him that future
violations could land him behind bars.</p>
<p>Moss and Freeman sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation for falsely
accusing them of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020
election. His lies upended their lives as they received racist threats
and harassment.</p>
<p>Giuliani smiled and chuckled as the judge explained why she was
holding him in contempt of court. Howell, who was nominated to the bench
by President Barack Obama, said it is “outrageous and shameful” for
Giuliani to suggest that he is the one who has been treated unfairly in
this case.</p>
<p>“This takes real chutzpah, Mr. Giuliani,” she said.</p>
<p>Giuliani calls judge ‘bloodthirsty’</p>
<p>Shortly before the hearing began, Giuliani slammed the judge in a
social media post, calling her “bloodthirsty” and biased against him and
the proceeding a “hypocritical waste of time.” After leaving the
courtroom, Giuliani called the hearing a farce and the judge “completely
biased and prejudiced.”</p>
<p>Giuliani briefly testified during Friday’s hearing, but only to
authenticate records about his personal finances.</p>
<p>The judge didn’t fine Giuliani for his most recent defamatory
comments about the case, but she said she would impose daily fines of
$200 if he doesn’t certify within 10 days that he has complied with her
order to review trial testimony and other case-related material.</p>
<p>A jury sided with the mother and daughter in December 2023 and
awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in
other damages</p>
<p>On Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt
of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help
the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida,
condominium.</p>
<p>Giuliani says he gets death threats</p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, had tried to get out of appearing in person Friday,
telling the judge he gets death threats and has been told to be careful
about traveling. But he withdrew his request to appear virtually after
the judge ordered him to explain whether he has traveled from his
Florida home within the past month.</p>
<p>On the witness stand at the defamation trial, Moss and Freeman
described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false
conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they
tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat
Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom
leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun
producing advanced 4-nanometer chips in Arizona for U.S. customers, a
milestone in the Biden administration’s semiconductor efforts, Commerce
Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters.</p>
<p>In November, the Commerce Department finalized a $6.6 billion grant
to TSMC’s U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix,
Arizona.</p>
<p>“For the first time ever in our country’s history, we are making
leading-edge 4-nanometer chips on American soil, American workers — on
par in yield and quality with Taiwan,” Raimondo told Reuters in an
interview, saying it had begun in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“That’s a big deal — never been done before, never in our history.
And lots of people said it couldn’t happen,” Raimondo said of the
previously undisclosed production start.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a
major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, which reports earnings next week,
declined to comment Friday.</p>
<p>In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion
to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona production facility by
2030.</p>
<p>Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and
research subsidy program in 2022. Commerce persuaded all five
leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate production facilities in the
United States as part of the program.</p>
<p>Raimondo told Reuters earlier that Commerce had to persuade TSMC to
boost its U.S. plans.</p>
<p>“It didn’t happen on its own. … We had to convince TSMC that they
would want to expand,” Raimondo said.</p>
<p>TSMC will produce the world’s most advanced 2-nanometer technology at
its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC
also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology,
called “A16,” in Arizona.</p>
<p>The TSMC award from Commerce also includes up to $5 billion in
low-cost government loans.</p>
<p>Raimondo wants the United States to make 20% of world’s leading-edge
logic chips by 2030 — up from the 0% before TSMC began production in
Arizona.</p>
<p>In April, Commerce said TSMC expects to begin high-volume production
in its first U.S. fab by the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>Last month, Commerce finalized an award of $407 million to help fund
Amkor Technology’s planned $2 billion advanced semiconductor packaging
facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest of its kind in the
U.S.</p>
<p>When fully operational, Amkor’s Arizona plant will package and test
millions of chips for autonomous vehicles, 5G/6G and data centers. Apple
will be its first and largest customer, with the chips produced at a
nearby TSMC facility.</p>

ices roads, closes schools, delays flights in southern US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — A powerful winter storm that dumped heavy snow and
glazed roads with ice across much of Texas and Oklahoma lumbered
eastward into Southern United States Friday, making for dicey travel and
a rare snow day for many students. </p>
<p>Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized their National Guards for tasks
such as helping stranded motorists, as governors in multiple states
declared states of emergency. School was canceled for millions of
children from Texas to Georgia and as far east as South Carolina. </p>
<p>The storm piled up more than a year’s worth of snowfall on some
Southern cities. As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts
of Arkansas. There were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25
centimeters) in Little Rock, a city that averages 3.8 inches (9.7
centimeters) a year. </p>
<p>More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis
International Airport in Tennessee since late Thursday. The city usually
sees 2.7 inches (6.9 centimeters) a year. In some areas where snow
tapered off, such as Memphis, Tennessee, the worry was that wet roads
would freeze overnight. </p>
<p>Farther south and east into Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Georgia, a wintry mix of sleet, snow and ice made travel
treacherous. </p>
<p>The heavy wet stuff also packed into a pretty good snowball. </p>
<p>In Atlanta, Georgia, Mikayla Johnson, 12, was out making snow angels
and snowmen on her day off from school. </p>
<p>“My first thought was, ‘Wow!’” said Mikayla, who was outdoors with
her father, Nate. “We haven’t had snow since I was, like, 4 – good snow,
at least. So I was really happy.” </p>
<p>The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some
spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. </p>
<p>And in the Kansas City area, students were back at school in several
districts Thursday after three straight snow days, only to see classes
called off again Friday because of more snow. </p>
<p>Snow began falling in metro Atlanta before dawn, leading to hundreds
of flights being cancelled and hundreds more delayed at the world’s
busiest airport, according to flight tracking software FlightAware.
Controllers declared a ground stop before 8 a.m., meaning no planes
could land or take off. </p>
<p>Four passengers were injured after a Delta plane bound for
Minneapolis aborted takeoff Friday morning, according to the
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. One passenger was
hospitalized, while three people were treated at the scene for minor
injuries. </p>
<p>The incident contributed to further delays, although Delta said it
was unclear whether the weather had anything to do with the flight
aborting its takeoff. The airline said there was an indication of an
engine issue. </p>
<p>Other airports with significant delays and cancellations included
those in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dallas-Fort Worth and Nashville.
Fifty-five passengers on three American Airlines flights that were
diverted from Dallas-Fort Worth spent the night at the Bill and Hillary
Clinton National Airport in Little Rock. </p>
<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged residents to avoid driving if
possible. Some 75,000 fans were expected Friday at AT&amp;T Stadium in
Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas
and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. </p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Some experts say such events are happening more frequently,
paradoxically, because of a warming world. </p>
<p>The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through
the Los Angeles area. </p>
<p>Southern discomfort </p>
<p>As much as 8 inches (about 20 centimeters) of snow was forecast in
parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through
Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Snow and ice were likely to
accumulate Friday across metro Atlanta, making roadways treacherous and
possibly causing power outages. </p>
<p>More than 1 million public school students in metro Atlanta and north
Georgia got a snow day or were at home learning online. </p>
<p>After a disastrous winter storm in 2014 left thousands of
Atlanta-area workers and schoolchildren stranded overnight away from
home, officials in Georgia were quick to cancel in-person classes and
close offices Friday. </p>
<p>Schools close</p>
<p>Many schools canceled classes Friday in Alabama’s northern half,
where roads were largely covered in snow or ice and some were already
impassible, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. </p>
<p>Tennessee’s largest school district, Memphis-Shelby County Schools,
closed all schools Friday. Tours at Graceland, Elvis Presley’s former
home-turned-museum, were canceled, a spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>Parts of South Carolina were seeing their first wintry weather in
three years. The state Department of Transportation treated interstates
and other major highways from Columbia northward, but vehicles were
slipping off icy Interstate 95 south of the city. Some schools
closed. </p>
<p>With snow, sleet and freezing rain expected across North Carolina, a
public outdoor inauguration ceremony Saturday in Raleigh, North
Carolina, for Governor Josh Stein and other elected officials was
canceled. The storm’s trajectory overlapped with much of the western
North Carolina area impacted by Hurricane Helene last year.</p>

<h2 id="one-reason-trump-wants-greenland-critical-minerals">One Reason
Trump Wants Greenland: Critical Minerals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
A top aide to incoming President Donald Trump is claiming the
president-elect wants the U.S. to acquire Greenland to acquire more rare
minerals.
</p>
<p>
“This is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,”
Trump’s soon-to-be national security advisor Michael Waltz told Fox News
host Jesse Watters
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6366840073112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Thursday
night</u></a>, adding: “You can call it Monroe Doctrine 2.0, but it’s
all part of the America First agenda.”
</p>
<p>
Greenland is rich in “rare earths,” a class of unique and uncommon
hardrock resources used for advanced weaponry, electronics, energy and
transportation technologies, including electric vehicles. It is home to
the Kvanefjeld deposit, believed to be one of the
<a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/the-kvanefjeld-project-potential-world-class-supplier-rare-earths/39520/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>richest
rare earth deposits in the world</u></a>. Kvanefjeld is also stuffed
with uranium, crucial for anything and everything nuclear.
</p>
<p>
Experts in security policy have
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/five-eyes-alliance-urged-to-forge-ties-with-greenland-to-secure-minerals-idUSKCN2AW0G4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated
for years</u></a> for Western nations to band together to ensure that
China, which controls the vast majority of the world’s rare earth
minerals, does not obtain a foothold in Greenland. U.S. and Danish
officials
have<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-lobbied-greenland-rare-earths-developer-tanbreez-not-sell-china-2025-01-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
reportedly urged</u></a> the developer of the island’s Tanbreez deposit
— rich in the rare earths-containing mineral eudialyte — not to sell its
project to any company linked to China. Eudialyte also contains high
amounts of neodymium, an exceedingly rare metal used in magnets coveted
by the tech sector.
</p>
<p>
If the U.S. somehow took control of Greenland, it could possibly seize
these resources from Denmark, a NATO ally, and the Greenlandic home-rule
government. So too could it lead to Greenlanders losing control of their
homeland. The country’s minerals have been a major source of domestic
debate, as politicians critical of mining have won
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-greenland-elections-europe-parliamentary-elections-d6a1dc76fd981b1aaa5abcf587eadfa2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
elections</u></a> and regulators have since
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/greenland-bans-uranium-mining-halting-rare-earths-project-2021-11-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fought

<a href="https://www.mining.com/web/greenland-rejects-energy-transitions-alternate-licence-proposal-in-draft-decision/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
their plans</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Waltz didn’t go into that much detail on Fox. But he made it clear how
the incoming administration sees the situation around control of the
island.
</p>
<p>
“Denmark can be a great ally, but you can’t treat Greenland, which they
have operational control over, as some kind of backwater,” Waltz told
Waters. “The people of Greenland, all 56,000 of them, are excited about
the prospect of making the Western Hemisphere great again.”

id="us-intelligence-mostly-rejects-links-between-havana-syndrome-adversaries">US
intelligence mostly rejects links between ‘Havana Syndrome,’
adversaries</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence agencies charged with investigating
the spate of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have
struck hundreds of officials remain unconvinced that the illnesses are
tied to the work of a foreign adversary.</p>
<p>An updated intelligence assessment of what the U.S. government calls
anomalous health incidents, or AHIs, released Friday calls the
possibility that the health symptoms were caused by a foreign actor or
weapon “very unlikely.”</p>
<p>The conclusion, endorsed by five of the seven U.S. intelligence
agencies tasked with investigating the ailments, commonly known as
Havana Syndrome, match the results of a 2023 assessment that found
symptoms “were probably the result of factors that did not involve a
foreign adversary, such as preexisting conditions, conventional
illnesses and environmental factors.”</p>
<p>New information, described by officials as being “sensitive” in
nature, only served to further support the 2023 findings, they said.</p>
<p>“The intelligence does not link a foreign actor to these events.
Indeed, it points away from their involvement,” according to a U.S.
intelligence official who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity to discuss the latest findings.</p>
<p>“All IC [intelligence community] components agree that years of
history collection, targeting and analytic efforts have not surfaced
compelling intelligence reporting that ties a foreign actor to any
specific event reported as a possible AHI,” the official said.</p>
<p>The new assessment contrasts, however, with a December House
Intelligence subcommittee report, which accused U.S. intelligence
agencies of sloppy work and attempting to “create a politically
palatable conclusion.”</p>
<p>There is reliable evidence to suggest that some anomalous health
incidents are the work of foreign adversaries,” CIA Subcommittee
Chairman Rick Crawford, a Republican, said at the time.</p>
<p>On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Mike
Turner, accused the new U.S. intelligence report of again falling
short.</p>
<p>“This new intelligence, I believe, should completely change the
assessment of our adversaries’ capabilities and the risks to our
personnel,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the disagreement, some of the evidence pointing to foreign
involvement in Havana Syndrome injuries appears to be finding more
credibility with some elements of U.S. intelligence.</p>
<p>Two of the seven agencies contributing to the latest assessment,
which looked at intelligence gathered as recently as last month, now
assess with “low confidence” that a foreign hand could be involved in a
limited number of cases.</p>
<p>One of the agencies now judges “there is ‘roughly even chance’ a
foreign actor has used a novel weapon or prototype device to harm a
small, undetermined subset of the USG [U.S. government] personnel or
dependents,” according to the declassified assessment.</p>
<p>The other agency concluded there is a “roughly even chance” that a
U.S. adversary has developed such a weapon, although the report states
even if that is the case, “it is unlikely a foreign actor has deployed
such a weapon in any events reported as possible AHIs.”</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence official who spoke with reporters described the
change as “subtle,” arguing, “they shift from unlikely with low
confidence to roughly even chance with low confidence.”</p>
<p>But White House officials Friday seemed to see the change as
something more significant.</p>
<p>“Today’s updated Intelligence Community Assessment, which is the
product of ongoing analytic efforts and includes a shift in key
judgments by some intelligence components,” said National Security
Council spokesperson Sean Savett.</p>
<p>“[It] only reinforces why it is vital that the U.S. government
continue critical research, investigate credible incidents and
strengthen efforts to provide timely care and long-term clinical
follow-up,” he said.</p>
<p>That includes ongoing research into the potential to weaponize pulsed
electromatic energy.</p>
<p>A February 2022 report by a panel of experts warned that the core
symptoms in a small number of Havana Syndrome cases were “distinctly
unusual” and suggested some sort of device must be responsible.</p>
<p>“Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency
range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,” the 2022 report
said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have, until now, mostly dismissed such claims, arguing
that nothing in the available intelligence agencies or in medical
studies supports that radiofrequency waves could be weaponized.</p>
<p>Medical research has “historically shown no harmful bioeffects,”
according to the latest U.S. assessment.</p>
<p>But the new assessment noted, “more recent, limited studies have
produced mixed preliminary results.”</p>
<p>“We have made it a priority to continue research in this area, to
understand the effects of directed energy, which is an area that
requires much more ongoing work,” a senior administration official told
reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S.
response.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that we do not understand,” the official said. “We are
gaining greater insight over time.”</p>
<p>The admission is not enough for some suffering from Havana
Syndrome.</p>
<p>The new assessment “disgracefully continues to hide the truth behind
a cloak of secrecy,” said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who
represents dozens of victims.</p>
<p>Zaid said he has filed a request to declassify the full report and
called on President-elect Donald Trump to “require full disclosure of
what the government knows.”</p>
<p>“Evidence of the use of directed energy, particularly by Russia, of
some form spans decades,” Zaid said in a statement shared with VOA. “The
CIA has sought to cover up its knowledge through both Democrat and
Republican administrations, and classified information exists that we
have knowledge of that fundamentally contradicts today’s report.”</p>
<p>Others have challenged the U.S. intelligence findings on Havana
Syndrome.</p>
<p>An investigation in April by CBS’s “60 Minutes” show, Germany’s Der
Spiegel and The Insider said a review of travel documents and mobile
phone records, along with eyewitness testimony and interviews with
multiple U.S. officials and victims, shows that Russia is likely to
blame.</p>
<p>Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana
Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia’s military
intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and assassinations.
It found that members of GRU Unit 29155 had received awards and
promotions for their work on sound or radio frequency-based directed
energy weapons.</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence official Friday, however, pushed back against
the findings.</p>
<p>“The claims do not hold up to scrutiny,” the official said.</p>
<p>Cases of Havana Syndrome were first publicly reported among diplomats
and other employees at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016.
Symptoms range from nausea and dizziness to debilitating headaches and
memory problems, with cases having been reported in Russia, China,
Poland, Austria and the United States.</p>
<p>“These are our colleagues and friends,” said the U.S. intelligence
official, stressing that the assessment’s failure to link to a foreign
adversary is not meant to question the suffering of those afflicted.</p>
<p>“These personnel and their dependents experienced genuine, sometimes
painful and traumatic, physical symptoms and sensory phenomena, and they
honestly and sincerely reported those events as possible,” the official
said.</p>

respectively, it was the first sign of progress since the fires ignited
and roared out of control on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
The days ahead, though, won’t be easy. Though
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>the
Santa Ana winds</u></a> dipped enough on Thursday and Friday for
firefighters to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>establish
a foothold</u></a>, two upcoming wind events have forecasters and
emergency management officials worried. The first will be shorter-lived,
beginning on Saturday afternoon and continuing through Sunday, but “it
does look significant enough where we might need additional red flag
warnings,” Ryan Kittel, an L.A.-based meteorologist with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. NOAA is anticipating
gusts of between 35 and 50 miles per hour during that event, and at
those speeds, aerial firefighting support will likely be grounded again.
</p>
<p>
A second wind event will follow that one, which is tracking to hit
Monday night into Tuesday. “We’re still figuring out the exact details
as far as the strength, but we’re very confident that it won’t be nearly
as strong as the winds we saw on Tuesday this week,” Kittel said. “But
it could be number two in the ranks of wind events that we’ve had over
the last seven days.”
</p>
<p>
The associated concerns are twofold. The first is that the return of
strong wind gusts will fan the blazes that firefighters are only now
getting a handle on, potentially pushing the fires into new areas. But
there’s another concern, too: that <em><em>new</em></em> fires will
start.
</p>
<p>
“What we’re trying to communicate is that the environment is favorable
for a fire to get really big, really fast, if one starts. We just don’t
know <em><em>if</em></em> or <em><em>where</em></em>,” Kittel said.
</p>
<p>
Though the L.A. fires flared up as big as they have because of the Santa
Anas, the wind’s cessation creates new risks. The Santa Anas “blow the
fires towards the ocean,” Dan Reese, a veteran firefighter and the
founder and president of the International Wildfire Consulting Group,
told me. But when the Santa Anas subside and L.A.’s normal west-to-east
winds return, they’ll push the fires <em><em>back</em></em> in the other
direction and potentially into neighborhoods that haven’t burned yet.
</p>
<p>
“Right now, [firefighters’] challenge is what we call closing the back
door, making sure that what was once the <em><em>heel</em></em> of the
fire, or the back side of the fire, does not get up and all of a sudden
become a running head the other direction,” Reese explained.
</p>
<p>
The weather is one problem, and it’s a big one. But there are other
challenges, too. Firefighters are only human, and many are completely
exhausted after working double shifts and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>doing
the grueling work</u></a> of defending people and structures for days on
end.
</p>
<p>
There are also logistics-related challenges. Aerial firefighting is
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/wildfire-season-aerial-firefighters-plane-accidents-582c11df" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceedingly
complex and dangerous</u></a>, and pilots are only allowed to fly a
certain number of hours, which varies depending on whether operations
are conducted during the day or at night. “Rotating those crews and
keeping those crew hours balanced becomes critical, especially when
you’ve got ongoing, continuous fires,” Reese pointed out.
</p>
<p>
There’s one more bit of bad news. Putting out the fires is only the
first challenge. A second will come close on its heels: the mop-up.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the fire went through a community but the houses were left
standing,” Reese said. “Now all those structures and properties are at
the mercy of mudslides and rain, because all of the holding capacity
keeping the soil in place has now been burned off.” Soil can even become
hydrophobic after exposure to intense heat, repelling water instead of
absorbing it, making runoff even more severe.
</p>
<p>
But there is no rain in the forecast, and the fight against the L.A.
County fires — while it’s taken a turn for the better — is far from
over. Firefighters “have to deal with the disaster they’ve got right
now,” Reese said. “And then they’ll deal with the secondary disasters
when those occur.”

<p class="drop-caps">
Once the fires stop burning in Los Angeles and the city picks itself up
from the rubble, the chorus of voices asking how such a disaster could
have been prevented will rise. In California, the answer to that
desperate query is so often “better forestry management practices,” and
in particular “more controlled burns.” But that’s not always the full
story, and in the case of the historically destructive L.A. fires, many
experts doubt that prescribed burns and better vegetation management
would have mattered much at all.
</p>
<p>
Controlled burns are intentionally set and supervised by land managers
to clear out excess fuels such as shrubs, trees, and logs to reduce
wildfire risk. Many habitats also require fire to thrive, and so
ensuring they burn in a controlled manner is a win-win for natural
ecosystems and the man-made environment. But controlled burns also pose
a series of challenges. For one, complex permitting processes and
restrictions around when and where burns are allowed can deter agencies
from attempting them. Community backlash is also an issue, as residents
are often concerned about air quality as well as the possibility of the
prescribed fires spiraling out of control. Land management agencies also
worry about the liability risks of a controlled burn getting out of
hand.
</p>
<p>
Many of the state’s largest and most destructive fires — including the
Camp Fire in 2018, lightning complex fires in 2020, and Dixie Fire in
2021 — started in forests, and would therefore have likely been severely
curtailed had the state done more controlled burns.
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According
to ProPublica</u></a>, anywhere between 4.4 million and 11.8 million
acres used to burn annually in prehistoric California. By 2017,
overzealous fire suppression efforts driven by regulatory barriers and
short-term risk aversion had caused that number to drop to 13,000 acres.
While the state has increased the amount of prescribed fire in recent
years, the backlog of fuel is enormous.
</p>
<p>
But the L.A. fires didn’t start or spread in a forest. The largest
blaze, in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, ignited in a chaparral
environment full of shrubs that have been growing for about 50 years.
Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey and an
adjunct professor at the University of California, said that’s not
enough time for this particular environment to build up an “unnatural
accumulation of fuels.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s well within the historical fire frequency for that landscape,”
Keeley told my colleague, Emily Pontecorvo, for her reporting on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>what
started the fires</u></a>. Generally, he said, these chaparral
environments <em><em>should</em></em> burn every 30 to 130 years, with
coastal areas like Pacific Palisades falling on the longer end of that
spectrum. “Fuels are not really the issue in these big fires — it’s the
extreme winds. You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have
essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.”

We still don’t know what ignited the L.A. fires, and thus whether a
human, utility, or other mysterious source is to blame. But the
combination of factors that led to the blazes — wet periods that allowed
for abundant vegetation growth followed by drought and intensely
powerful winds — are simply a perilously bad combination. Firebreaks,
strips of land where vegetation is reduced or removed, can often prove
helpful, and they do exist in the L.A. hillsides. But as Matthew
Hurteau, a professor at the University of New Mexico and director of the
Center for Fire Resilient Ecosystems and Society, told me bluntly, “When
you have 100-mile-an-hour winds pushing fire, there’s not a hell of a
lot that’s going to stop it.”
</p>
<p>
Hurteau told me that he thinks of the primary drivers of destructive
fires as a triangle, with fuels, climate, and the built environment
representing the three points. “We’re definitely on the built
environment, climate side of that triangle for these particular fires
around Los Angeles,” Hurteau explained, meaning that the wildland-urban
interface combined with drought and winds are the primary culprits. But
in more heavily forested, mountainous areas of Northern California, “you
get the climate and fuels side of the triangle,” Hurteau said.
</p>
<p>
Embers can travel impressive distances in the wind, as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4AU_U9YwlM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>evidenced</u></a>
by
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/wildfire-jumps-highway-california-vehicles-catch-fire-32530675" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>footage</u></a>
of past fires jumping expansive freeways in Southern California. So, as
Hurteau put it, “short of mowing whole hillsides down to nothing and
keeping them that way,” there’s little vegetation management work to be
done at the wildland-urban interface, where houses bump up against
undeveloped lands.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone agrees, though. When I spoke to Susan Prichard, a fire
ecologist and research scientist at the University of Washington School
of Environmental and Forest Sciences, she told me that while prescribed
burns close to suburban areas can be contentious and challenging,
citizens can do a lot on their own to manage fuel risk. “Neighborhoods
can come together and do the appropriate fuel reduction in and around
their homes, and that makes a huge difference in wildfires,” she told
me. “Landscaping in and around homes matters, even if you have
100-mile-an-hour winds with a lot of embers.”
</p>
<p>
Prichard recommends residents work with their neighbors to remove
burnable vegetation and organic waste, and to get rid of so-called
“ember traps” such as double fencing that can route fires straight to
homes. Prichard
<a href="https://sbfiresafecouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kolden_Hensen_Case-Study_Thomas-Fire.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
to research </u></a>by Crystal Kolden, a “pyrogeographer” and associate
professor at the University of California Merced, whose work focuses on
understanding wildfire intersections with the human environment. Kolden
has argued that proper vegetation management could have greatly lessened
the impact of the L.A. fires. As she recently
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pyrogeog.bsky.social/post/3lfd7jfszcr2l" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
on Bluesky</u></a>, “These places will see fire again. I have no doubt.
But I also know that you can rebuild and manage the land so that next
time the houses won’t burn down. I’ve seen it work.”
</p>
<p>
Keeley pointed to the 2017 Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara
Counties, however, as an example of the futility of firebreaks and
prescribed burns in extreme situations. That fire also ignited outside
of what’s normally considered fire season, in December. “There were
thousands of acres that had been prescribed burned near the eastern edge
of that fire perimeter in the decade prior to ignition,” Keeley
explained to Emily. “Once that fire was ignited, the winds were so
powerful it just blew the embers right across the prescribed burn area
and resulted in one of the largest wildfires that we’ve had in Southern
California.”
</p>
<p>
Kolden, however, reads the Thomas Fire as a more optimistic story. As
she wrote in a
<a href="https://sbfiresafecouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kolden_Hensen_Case-Study_Thomas-Fire.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>case
report on the fire</u></a> published in 2019, “Despite the extreme wind
conditions and interviewee estimates of potentially hundreds of homes
being consumed, only seven primary residences were destroyed by the
Thomas Fire, and firefighters indicated that pre-fire mitigation
activities played a clear, central role in the outcomes observed.” While
the paper didn’t focus on controlled burns, mitigation activities
discussed include reducing vegetation around homes and roads, as well as
common-sense actions such as increasing community planning and
preparedness, public education around fire safety, and arguably most
importantly, adopting and enforcing fire-resistant building codes.
</p>
<p>
So while blaming decades of forestry mismanagement for major fires is
frequently accurate, in Southern California the villains in this
narrative can be trickier to pin down. Is it the fault of the winds? The
droughts? The humans who want to live in beautiful but acutely
fire-prone areas? The planning agencies that allow people to fulfill
those risky dreams?
</p>
<p>
Prichard still maintains that counties and the state government can be
doing a whole lot more to encourage fuel reduction. “That might not be
prescribed burning, that might actually be ongoing mastication of some
of the really big chaparral, so that it’s not possible for really tall,
developed, even senescent vegetation — meaning having a lot of dead
material in it — to burn that big right next to homes.”
</p>
<p>
From Hurteau’s perspective though, far and away the most effective
solution would be simply building structures to be much more
fire-resilient than they are today. “Society has chosen to build into a
very flammable environment,” Hurteau put it. California’s population has
increased over 160% since the 1950’s, far outpacing the country overall
and pushing development further and further out into areas that border
forests, chaparral, and grasslands. “As people rebuild after what’s
going to be great tragedy, how do you re-envision the built environment
so that this becomes less likely to occur in the future?”

administration extends temporary status for 4 nationalities</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — About 600,000 Venezuelans and more than 230,000
Salvadorans already living in the United States can legally remain
another 18 months, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday,
barely a week before President-elect Donald Trump takes office with
promises of hard-line immigration policies.</p>
<p>Biden’s administration has strongly supported Temporary Protected
Status, which he has expanded to cover about 1 million people. TPS faces
an uncertain future under Trump, who tried to sharply curtail its use
during his first term as president. Federal regulations would allow the
extensions to be terminated early, although that’s never been done
before.</p>
<p>Homeland Security also extended TPS for more than 103,000 Ukrainians
and 1,900 Sudanese who are already living in the U.S.</p>
<p>The TPS designation gives people legal authority to be in the
country, but it doesn’t provide a long-term path to citizenship. They
are reliant on the government renewing their status when it expires.
Conservative critics have said that over time, the renewal of the
protection status becomes automatic, regardless of what is happening in
the person’s home country.</p>
<p>Friday’s announcement, which came as Venezuelan President Nicolas
Maduro took office for a third six-year term in Caracas amid widespread
international condemnation, is “based on the severe humanitarian
emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic
crises under the Maduro regime,” the department said.</p>
<p>Homeland Security cited “environmental conditions in El Salvador that
prevent individuals from returning,” specifically heavy rains and storms
in the last two years.</p>
<p>Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries
suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people
authorization to work in increments of up to 18 months at a time.</p>
<p>About 1 million immigrants from 17 countries are protected by TPS,
including people from Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon. Venezuelans are one of the
largest beneficiaries, and their extension runs from April 2025 to
October 2, 2026.</p>
<p>Salvadorans won TPS in 2001 after earthquakes rocked the Central
American country. TPS for Salvadorans was to expire in March and was
extended until Sept. 9, 2026.</p>
<p>Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, suggested they would scale back
the use of TPS and policies granting temporary status as they pursue
mass deportations. During his first administration, Trump ended TPS for
El Salvador but was held up in court.</p>
<p>In recent months, advocates have increased pressure on the Biden
administration to ask for TPS extensions for those who already have it
and to protect people from other countries such as Guatemala and
Ecuador.</p>
<p>“This extension is just a small victory,” said Felipe Arnoldo Diaz,
an activist with the National TPS Alliance. “Our biggest concern is that
after El Salvador, there are countries whose TPS are expiring soon and
are being left out,” such as Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras.</p>
<p>The money that Salvadorans send home is a major economic support for
the Central American country, potentially complicating efforts to end
TPS for the U.S. ally. Trump has had warm relations with Salvadoran
President Nayib Bukele, who worked closely with him on preventing
illegal immigration to the U.S. Remittances amount to about $7.5 billion
a year.</p>
<p>Bukele is immensely popular, largely because his heavy-handed
security efforts have eviscerated the country’s street gangs.</p>

id="preventive-action-cant-avert-wildfires-but-can-save-lives-meteorologists-say">Preventive
action can’t avert wildfires but can save lives, meteorologists say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — The World Meteorlogical Organization says that preventive
action cannot avert natural disasters such as the wildfires raging
across Los Angeles, but that it can help save lives and mitigate loss of
property.</p>
<p>“Land management and prevention, regular clearing of underbrush play
a key role in fire management, and evacuation plans are important in
saving lives,” the WMO said Friday. “These are all part of effective
early warning systems.”</p>
<p>In a briefing to journalists in Geneva, Claire Nullis, a WMO
spokesperson, stressed the importance of preparing adequate evacuation
plans and early warning systems to prevent some of the worst impacts
from a natural disaster.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the staggering losses from the devastating
wildfires sweeping across parts of Los Angeles in the United States this
week, she said “The early warnings have, in this instance, been very,
very good.</p>
<p>“You know, people have been evacuated. It has been impossible to save
houses, and the loss of life is still too high, but it has been kept to
a relative minimum,” she said.</p>
<p>Media reports say at least 10 people have been killed in this week’s
Southern California wildfires, although more bodies are expected to be
found once the fires have been contained and searchers can go through
the debris.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 structures reportedly have burned, and 180,000
people are under evacuation orders.</p>
<p>While California is no stranger to wildfires, the WMO calls this
catastrophic event “extraordinary” in that it is affecting one of the
largest cities in the United States.</p>
<p>The WMO said that last year’s rainy season for the Los Angeles area
as a whole was slightly above normal, but so far, this year it has been
dry.</p>
<p>“The big compounding factor in this context is the winds. … They
cause temperatures to rise, and they cause very low humidity, drying out
the ground and vegetation,” Nullis said.</p>
<p>The WMO said destructive wildfires have been made worse by climate
change.</p>
<p>“Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought and a
thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and
extent of wildfires in the western United States during the last
decades,” it said, citing data from the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p>The WMO said wildfires require the alignment of a number of factors,
including temperature, humidity and the lack of moisture in fuels such
as trees, shrubs, grasses and forest debris.</p>
<p>“All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate
variability and climate change,” it said.</p>
<p>“Obviously, not every single weather-related disaster is due to
climate change,” WMO spokesperson Nullis said. “Nobody would say that.
But we get quite clear signals that climate change is exacerbating some
of these disasters.”</p>
<p>In addition to the loss of life and destruction of homes and other
infrastructure that could total billions of dollars in insured losses,
the World Health Organization warns that wildfires can have a
significant impact on human morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>“Wildfire smoke, which is a mixture of air pollutants, of which
particulate matter is of major concern as it can be full of PM 2.5. This
is a very small particulate matter that gets right down into the lungs,
and there certainly is a lot of it.” said Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO
spokesperson.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is associated with premature death in the general
population,” she said. “It can cause and exacerbate diseases of lung,
heart, brain, the nervous system” and other illnesses.</p>
<p>“It has been shown to lead to cognitive impairment and actually
damage your intellectual capacity and lead to memory loss,” she said,
adding that firefighters and emergency response workers “are most at
risk from exposure to smoke.”</p>
<p>The WHO estimates 4.2 million deaths globally are linked to ambient
or outdoor air pollution, with 99% of the global population exposed to
air pollution levels that exceed the WHO guideline level for fine
particulate matter (PM 2.5).</p>
<p>Harris said more research is needed to understand the long-term
health effects of wildfire exposure on vulnerable populations,
particularly children, older people, pregnant women and the chronically
ill.</p>
<p>“We expect that we will see this over and over again if we do not get
what we are doing to the planet under control,” she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization has officially
confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, “with a global mean
temperature of more than 1.5 degrees above the 1850-1900 average.”</p>
<p>“We have just endured the hottest decade on record, with 2024 topping
the list,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, noting that
“blazing temperatures in 2024 require trailblazing climate action in
2025.”</p>
<p>“There is still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But
leaders must act now,” he said.</p>

Misinformation About the L.A. Fires Keeps Spreading</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Almost no city in the country is destroyed more often than Los Angeles.
America’s second-biggest city has been flattened, shaken, invaded,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_(1997_film)" target="_blank"><u>subsumed
by lava</u></a>, and calved off into the sea dozens of times on screen
over the years; as the filmmaker and critic Thom Andersen has said,
“Hollywood destroys Los Angeles because it’s there.”
</p>
<p>
But, understandably, when this destruction leaps from Netflix to a
newscast, it’s an entirely different horror to behold. The L.A. County
fires have now collectively burned an area more than twice the size of
Manhattan; more than 10,000 businesses and homes that were standing last
weekend are now ash. Officially, 10 people have died, but emergency
managers have warned the public to brace for more. “It looks like an
atomic bomb dropped in these areas. I don’t expect good news, and we’re
not looking forward to those numbers,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert
Luna said in
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/hollywood-hills-burn-la-engulfed-by-the-big-one-2025-01-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
late Thursday press conference</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The mind gropes for an explanation for this horror — and lands in
bizarre places. Much has been made in the past few days of the rampant
proliferation of conspiracy theories and rumors about the fires, ranging
from the believable to the totally absurd. Alex Jones has
<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/01/los-angeles-fires-elon-musk-alex-jones-conspiracy-theory-globalists.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a>
the fires are part of a “globalist plot to wage economic warfare and
deindustrialize the U.S.” (a theory incoming government official Elon
Musk endorsed as
“<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1877121563285217308" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>true</u></a>”).
<a href="https://x.com/lwoodhouse/status/1877089399676055788" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Libs
of TikTok</u></a> and
<a href="https://x.com/WUTangKids/status/1876982706933834132" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>others</u></a>
have said that the Los Angeles Fire Department’s hiring practices
emphasizing diversity have left it strapped for personnel to fight the
wildfires (Musk
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1877224004680843539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>endorsed</u></a>
this one, too). President-elect Donald Trump has blamed California
Gov. Gavin Newsom for the well-publicized occurrence of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>dry
fire hydrants</u></a>, citing a “water declaration resolution” that
supposedly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-water" target="_self"><u>limited
firefighters’ access to water</u></a>, even though
<a href="https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1877067195043221875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>such
a thing doesn’t exist</u></a>. Still others have taken to TikTok to
spread claims that the fires were
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8FkFNbH/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intentionally
started</u></a> to burn rapper and producer Sean “Diddy” Combs’ property
and hide criminal evidence that could be used to support
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/sean-diddy-combs-controversies-timeline-1234889043/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sex
trafficking and racketeering charges</u></a> against him
(<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/sean-diddy-combs-home-path-palisades-fire-map-2011372" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>another
lie</u></a>). Mel Gibson even
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/profsanderlinden.bsky.social/post/3lffdiijr3k2k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>used
the disaster</u></a> as an opportunity to share his thoughts about
climate change on<em><em> The Joe Rogan Podcast </em></em>(spoiler
alert: he doesn’t think it’s real), even as his house in Malibu
<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/mel-gibson-wildfires-malibu-house-burned-down-joe-rogan-1236106022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned
to the ground</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“We need some kind of explanation psychologically, especially if you’re
not accustomed to that kind of thing happening,” Margaret Orr Hoeflich,
a misinformation scholar, told me of how conspiracy theories spring up
during disasters. She added that much of the rhetoric she’s seen — like
that some cabal set the fires intentionally — has been used to “explain”
other similar disasters,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-hawaii-maui-wildfires-chile-dew-434395550756" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including
the wildfire in Lahaina in 2023</u></a>. (“The Diddy one is really
unique,” she allowed.)
</p>
<p>
It’s convenient to call this the coping mechanism of loons, bad actors,
the far right, or people who want to promote a political agenda
disingenuously, but left-leaning thinkers aren’t exempt. Posts blaming
ChatGPT make important points about AI technologies’ energy and water
use, but the
<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/is-chatgpt-ai-water-use-part-of-what-caused-the-wildfires.html#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fires
aren’t “because” of ChatGPT</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also seen the fires blamed on “forest management,” although the
landscape around L.A. isn’t trees; it’s shrubland. “This kind of
environment isn’t typically exposed to low intensity, deep, frequent
fires creeping through the understory, like many dry forests of the
Sierra Nevadas or even Eastern Oregon and Washington,” where
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
U.S. Forest Service’s history of fire</u></a> has created the conditions
for the high-intensity megafires of today, Max Moritz, a cooperative
extension wildfire specialist at U.C. Santa Barbara’s Bren School of
Environmental Science and Management, told me earlier this week. The
shrublands around L.A., rather, “naturally have long-interval,
high-intensity, stand-replacing fires” — that is, fires that level
almost all vegetation in an area before new growth begins.
</p>
<p>
The fires in L.A. are extreme not so much because the landscape hasn’t
been managed properly (not to mention that prescribed burns in the steep
hillsides and suburbs are challenging and huge liabilities), but rather
because we’ve built neighborhoods into a wildland that
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pyrogeog.bsky.social/post/3lfd7je7gw22l" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
burned before and will burn again</u></a>. But unless your algorithm is
tuned to the frequency of climate and weather models, you won’t
necessarily find this more complicated narrative on social media.
</p>
<p>
We should also be precise in how we talk about climate change in
relation to the fires. It’s true the fires have an excess of dry
vegetative fuels after a wet winter and spring, which germinated lots of
new green shoots, followed by a hot, dry summer and delayed start to the
rainy season, which burned them to a crisp — classic “see-sawing”
between extremes that you can expect to see as the planet warms. But
droughts
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=The%20Oddballs-,Drought,-When%20I%20spoke" target="_self"><u>don’t
always have a strong climate change signal</u></a>, and wildfires can be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=of%20climate%20change.-,Wildfires,-WWA%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20specifically" target="_self"><u>tricky
to attribute</u></a> to global warming definitively. Were the Los
Angeles fires exacerbated by our decades of burning fossil fuels? It is
pretty safe to say so! But right-wing narratives aren’t the only ones
that benefit from an exaggerated posture of certainty.
</p>
<p>
To state what is hopefully obvious: Being overly confident in
attributing a disaster to climate change is not equivalent to denying
the reality of climate change, the latter being very much more wrong and
destructive than the former. But it’s also true overall that humans, as
a species, don’t like ambiguity. Though the careful work of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>uncovering
causes</u></a> and attributing them can take years, it’s natural to look
for simple answers that confirm our worldviews or give us people to
blame — especially in the face of a disaster that is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-burning" target="_self"><u>so
unbelievably awful</u></a> and doesn’t have a clear end. If there’s a
role for the creative mind during all of this, it’s not in jumping to
logical extremes; it’s in looking forward, ambitiously and aggressively,
to how we can rebuild and live better.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of finger-pointing going around, and I would just try to
emphasize that this is a really complex problem,” Faith Kearns, a water
and wildfire researcher at Arizona State University, told me this week.
“We have lots of different responsible parties. To me, what has happened
requires more of a rethink than a blame game.”

id="us-slaps-new-sanctions-on-venezuelan-officials-as-maduro-inaugurated">US
slaps new sanctions on Venezuelan officials as Maduro inaugurated</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, TEXAS — The United States imposed sanctions
Friday on eight Venezuelan officials and increased to $25 million the
reward it is offering for the arrest of President Nicolas Maduro. The
actions came on the day of Maduro’s inauguration to a third term
following a disputed election last year.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a series of punitive steps by the outgoing Biden
administration against Maduro’s government in the aftermath of the July
vote, which both his ruling Socialist party and the OPEC nation’s
opposition claim to have won.</p>
<p>The new officials sanctioned include the recently appointed head of
Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA, Hector Obregon, and Venezuela’s
transportation minister, Ramon Velasquez.</p>
<p>The U.S. move coincided with sanctions announced by Britain and the
European Union.</p>
<p>Maduro and his aides have always rejected sanctions by the U.S. and
others, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an
“economic war” designed to cripple Venezuela. He and his allies have
cheered what they say is the country’s resilience despite the measures,
although they have historically blamed some economic hardships and
shortages on sanctions.</p>
<p>The country’s electoral authority and top court claim Maduro, whose
time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won
last year’s presidential vote, although they have not published detailed
tallies.</p>
<p>The government, which has accused the opposition of fomenting fascist
plots against it, said it will arrest opposition presidential candidate
Edmundo Gonzalez should he return to the country from exile and has
detained prominent opposition members and activists in the lead-up to
the inauguration.</p>
<p>The opposition says Gonzalez, 75, won in a landslide. It has
published its own vote tallies as evidence, winning support from
governments around the world, including the United States, who consider
Gonzalez the president-elect. International election observers have said
the vote was unfair.</p>
<p>Maduro, 62, has been in power since 2013, and the new sanctions come
little more than a week before U.S. President Joe Biden will end his
term and be succeeded by Donald Trump on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>In addition to the sanctions, the U.S. government increased to $25
million the reward it is offering for information leading to the arrest
and conviction of Maduro, who has long faced U.S. drug trafficking
charges. The reward was $15 million.</p>
<p>Maduro has held onto power despite heavy pressure from successive
U.S. administrations, retaining the support of Venezuela’s military as
well as China, Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>The new measures had been in the works before the brief detention
Thursday of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following an
anti-government march in Caracas, her first public appearance after
months out of the public eye.</p>

<h2 id="us-japan-expand-sanctions-on-russia">US, Japan expand sanctions
on Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan Friday imposed new sanctions on Russia, in moves
designed to constrain Russia’s ability to continue funding its war on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>The U.S. sanctions, imposed through the Treasury Department and
announced simultaneously through the State Department and the White
House, are aimed at reducing Russia’s revenue from energy production,
and target two of Russia’s largest oil producers, Gazprom Neft and
Surgutneftegas.</p>
<p>Those sanctioned include more than 200 entities and individuals
involved in Russia’s energy sector, including traders of Russian oil,
Russia-based oilfield service providers, and Russian energy officials.
The U.S. also designated 180 oil-carrying vessels as “blocked property.”
Many are part of Russia’s “shadow fleet,” used to covertly transport
Russian oil around the world.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the White House, deputy national security
adviser Daleep Singh said, “These measures will collectively drain
billions of dollars per month from the Kremlin’s war chest and, in doing
so, intensify the costs and risks for Moscow to continue its senseless
war.”</p>
<p>Likewise, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi announced
Friday that Tokyo is freezing the assets of 33 organizations and 12
individuals, including a North Korean national, under the country’s
foreign exchange and foreign trade law.</p>
<p>An additional 53 organizations from Russia, China and other countries
became subject to export bans and other measures. The cabinet secretary
said Japan was taking the actions in response to North Korea’s support
for the Russian war effort and Russia’s use of third nations to avoid
previous sanctions.</p>
<p>From his X social media account, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude and called both measures “a
significant blow” to Russia’s ability to wage war.</p>
<p>He said Japan’s measures will help “limit Russia’s access to critical
microelectronics and [creates] additional obstacles for the production
of missiles and drones.” Zelenskyy said the U.S. sanctions on Russia’s
oil producing sector will disrupt Russia’s entire supply chain.</p>
<p>“Such actions send a clear message: Criminals must pay for their
crimes,” Zelenskyy said. “The less revenue Russia earns from oil and
other energy resources, the sooner peace will be restored.”</p>
<p>Moscow, naturally, had a different reaction. During a telephone news
briefing Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that
through the sanctions, the outgoing Biden administration is trying “to
leave behind the most toxic legacy possible when it comes to bilateral
relations” between Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>Peskov, referring to a new round of military aid approved by the U.S.
and its European allies in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on
Thursday, also accused the outgoing Biden administration of trying to
perpetuate the war in Ukraine before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump
takes office.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday that the
United States will provide an additional $500 million in military aid to
Ukraine.</p>

Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

<h2 id="jimmy-carters-post-presidential-legacy">Jimmy Carter’s
post-presidential legacy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>James Earl Carter Jr. served a single term as the 39th president of
the United States, but despite his short tenure, he had the most
extensive post-presidential career in U.S. history, lasting from 1981
until his death in 2024. </p>
<p>Carter was a peanut farmer before his presidency and placed the
family farm in a blind trust when he took office. But it was heavily in
debt when he returned, so Carter generated income through writing. He
published more than 30 books from memoirs and nonfiction to children’s
books and historical novels. </p>
<p>The first major achievement of Carter’s post-presidential career was
the 1982 founding of The Carter Center, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to promoting human rights.  </p>
<p>The center would go on to operate a broad range of initiatives
worldwide, often working with the United Nations. One of its most
prominent roles has been election monitoring, having observed and
produced reports on elections in 40 countries as a neutral organization
unaffiliated with the U.S. government.  </p>
<p>The Carter Center would also become known for its public health and
agricultural assistance programs. Among these are ongoing efforts to
combat river blindness and trachoma in developing nations by
distributing medication and building toilet facilities. A major
accomplishment has been the near-eradication of Guinea worm disease in
Africa — the first such eradication achieved without any
pharmaceuticals. </p>
<p>Carter himself continued to travel extensively to promote diplomatic
efforts, both as a private citizen and as an unofficial negotiator for
the United States. During the Ronald Reagan administration, he traveled
to the Middle East to support the continuation of the Camp David Accords
that his administration had brokered between Egypt and Israel, and he
met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to advance the peace
process.  </p>
<p>Carter helped to secure a temporary ceasefire during the Yugoslav
Wars, and in 1994, went to North Korea at the request of President Bill
Clinton to negotiate a treaty governing nuclear non-proliferation. He
would later return to North Korea in 2010 to secure the release of
Aijalon Gomes, an American citizen who had illegally crossed into the
country. </p>
<p>Along with his wife, Rosalynn, Carter was also known for his work
with Habitat for Humanity, an international charity dedicated to
building affordable housing for low-income families around the
world.  </p>
<p>After first volunteering for the organization in 1984, the Carters
launched an annual work project where they would personally participate
alongside volunteers on a particular building site. Carter served on the
organization’s board from 1984 to 1987. </p>
<p>Carter’s work in human rights and social justice has been widely
praised and earned him the 1998 United Nations Prize in the Field of
Human Rights, as well the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, making him the third
U.S. president to receive the honor.  </p>
<p>However, Carter has also been criticized for alleged anti-Israel bias
in his statements and writings on the Middle East, and for labeling
Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid in his bestselling yet
controversial 2006 book on the subject. </p>
<p>Carter was the longest-lived U.S. president, remaining active well
into his 90s until his eventual death at 100. While his four-year
presidency has often been considered a mediocre one by historians, his
post-presidency set a standard that will be difficult to surpass.</p>

id="us-added-256000-jobs-in-december-unemployment-rate-dips-to-4.1">US
added 256,000 jobs in December; unemployment rate dips to 4.1%</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. hiring picked up unexpectedly in December as
employers added a strong 256,000 jobs, another sign of the economy’s
resilience in the face of high interest rates. </p>
<p>Job growth rose 212,000 last month from November, the Labor
Department reported Friday. </p>
<p>For all of 2024, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, a solid number
but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 6.4
million in 2021 as the economy bounded back from massive pandemic
layoffs. </p>
<p>The monthly numbers beat forecasters’ expectations of around 155,000
new jobs and 4.2% unemployment. Health care companies added 46,000 jobs,
retailers 43,000 and government agencies at the federal, state and local
33,000. But manufacturers cut 13,000 jobs. </p>
<p>Labor Department revisions shaved 8,000 jobs from October and
November payrolls. </p>
<p>Average hourly wages rose 0.3% from November and 3.9% from a year
earlier. The year-over-year wage gain was slightly less than economists
had forecast. </p>
<p>Stocks fell Friday morning on the expectations that the strong jobs
report will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates.
The economy doesn’t seem to need help. “It seems pretty certain that the
pace of Fed rate cuts is now going to slow down,” said Brian Coulton,
chief economist at Fitch Ratings. </p>
<p>Getting a clear view of the U.S. job market hasn’t been easy over the
past few months. </p>
<p>Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs
numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November
that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring. </p>
<p>Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said that seasonal
adjustments around the holidays may have affected the December numbers,
but he added that nonetheless “it is hard to say anything negative about
the details of this report.’’ </p>
<p>Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown
surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade
high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest
rate — the fed funds rate — 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the
highest level in more than two decades. </p>
<p>The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession
but didn’t. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the
economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product — the
nation’s output of goods and services — has expanded at a robust annual
pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters. </p>
<p>Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the
Labor Department reported that 211,000 people applied for unemployment
benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year. </p>
<p>Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to
2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the
Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months
of 2024. </p>
<p>But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they
planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project
just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned
back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent
months, and it remains stuck above the Fed’s 2% target.</p>

As Los Angeles continued to battle multiple big blazes ripping through
some of the most beloved (and expensive) areas of the city on Friday, a
question lingered in the background: What caused the fires in the first
place?
</p>
<p>
Though fires are less common in California during this time of the year,
they aren’t unheard of. In early December 2017, power lines sparked the
Thomas Fire near Ventura, California, which burned through to
mid-January. At the time it was the largest fire in the state since at
least the 1930s. Now
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s
the ninth-largest</u></a>. Although that fire was in a more rural area,
it ignited for some of the same reasons we’re seeing fires this week.
</p>
<p>
Read on for everything we know so far about how the fires started.
</p>
<h3>
How many fires are burning in Los Angeles County and where are they?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Six major fires started during the Santa Ana wind event this week:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Palisades Fire, in the Pacific Palisades, which has burned nearly
20,000 acres, started on Tuesday, January 7, around 10:30 a.m. Pacific
time.
</li>
<li>
The Eaton Fire, north of Pasadena, which has burned about 13,600 acres,
started on Tuesday just after 6:00 p.m.
</li>
<li>
The Hurst Fire, in the northern edge of the San Fernando Valley, which
has burned about 770 acres, started on Tuesday night around 10:30 pm.
</li>
<li>
The Lidia Fire, in Acton, California, just north of Angeles National
Forest, which has burned roughly 400 acres, started on Wednesday
afternoon around 1:00 p.m.
</li>
<li>
The Sunset Fire, in the Hollywood Hills, which has burned about 43
acres, started on Wednesday night around 5:30 p.m. Evacuation orders
lifted early Thursday morning, when the fire’s “forward progress has
been stopped,” and crews were working to “put out hotspots within the
fire perimeter and keep the wind from spreading embers,”
<a href="https://x.com/PIOErikScott" target="_blank"><u>according to Los
Angeles Fire Department Public Information Officer Erik Scott</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
The Kenneth Fire, in the hills above Calabasas, which burned about 960
acres, started on Thursday around 3:30 p.m.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
How did the fires start?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Officials have not made any statements about the cause of any of the
fires yet.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday morning, Edward Nordskog, a retired fire investigator from
the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, told me it was unlikely they had
even begun looking into the root of the biggest and most destructive of
the fires in the Pacific Palisades. “They don’t start an investigation
until it’s safe to go into the area where the fire started, and it just
hasn’t been safe until probably today,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It can take years to determine the cause of a fire. Investigators did
not pinpoint the cause of the Thomas Fire until March 2019, more than
two years after it started.
</p>
<p>
But Nordskog doesn’t think it will take very long this time. It’s easier
to narrow down the possibilities for an urban fire because there are
typically both witnesses and surveillance footage, he told me. He said
the most common causes of wildfires in Los Angeles are power lines and
those started by unhoused people. They can also be caused by sparks from
vehicles or equipment.
</p>
<h3>
How do these fires compare to past fires in California?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
At about 35,000 acres burned total, these fires are unlikely to make the
charts for the
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=097f901c128347149e2614f2fca4f546&hash=27DDE83DFEF9A69E67C73765892A2B75" target="_blank"><u>largest
in California history</u></a>. But because they are burning in urban,
densely populated, and expensive areas, they could be some of the most
devastating. With an
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated
9,000 structures damaged</u></a> as of Friday morning, the Eaton and
Palisades fires are likely to make the list for
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-destructive-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=9e4974c273274858880c2dd28292a96f&hash=29E21CBFCE8D9885F606246607D21CEB" target="_blank"><u>most
destructive wildfire events</u></a> in the state.
</p>
<p>
And they will certainly be at the top for costliest. The Palisades Fire
has already been declared a likely contender for the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-09/the-costliest-fire-on-record-not-just-for-california" target="_blank"><u>most
expensive wildfire in U.S. history</u></a>. It has destroyed
<a href="https://lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5,000</u></a> structures in some of the most expensive zip codes in
the country. Between that and the Eaton Fire, Accuweather estimates the
damages could reach
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$57
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these fires so bad? Is it climate change?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
While we don’t know the root causes of the ignitions, several factors
came together to create perfect fire conditions in Southern California
this week.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa
Ana winds</u></a>, an annual phenomenon in Southern California, when
very dry, high-pressure air gets trapped in the Great Basin and begins
escaping westward through mountain passes to lower-pressure areas along
the coast. Most of the time, the wind in Los Angeles blows eastward from
the ocean, but during a Santa Ana event, it changes direction, picking
up speed as it rushes toward the sea.
</p>
<p>
Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the US Geological Survey and an
adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles told me
that Santa Ana winds typically blow at maybe 30 to 40 miles per hour,
while the winds this week hit upwards of 60 to 70 miles per hour. “More
severe than is normal, but not unique,” he said. “We had similar severe
winds in 2017 with the Thomas Fire.”
</p>
<p>
Second, Southern California is currently in the midst of extreme
drought. Winter is typically a rainier season, but Los Angeles has seen
less than half an inch of rain since July. That means that all the
shrubland vegetation in the area is bone-dry. Again, Keeley said, this
was not usual, but not unique. Some years are drier than others.
</p>
<p>
These fires were also not a question of fuel management, Keeley told me.
“The fuels are not really the issue in these big fires. It’s the extreme
winds,” he said. “You can do prescription burning in chaparral and have
essentially no impact on Santa Ana wind-driven fires.” As far as he can
tell,
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/b71f526e-4b91-4cdc-99cd-f5e19c80105f" target="_blank"><u>based
on information from CalFire</u></a>, the Eaton Fire started on an urban
street.
</p>
<p>
While it’s likely that climate change played a role in amplifying the
drought, it’s hard to say how big a factor it was. Patrick Brown, a
climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct professor at
Johns Hopkins University, published a long
<a href="https://x.com/PatrickTBrown31/status/1877134442839310573" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post
on X</u></a> outlining the factors contributing to the fires, including
a
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/pcp/3/2/1895-2024?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1991&endbaseyear=2020&trend=true&trend_base=10&begtrendyear=1975&endtrendyear=2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a>
of historic rainfall during the winter in Los Angeles that shows
oscillations between wet and dry years over the past eight decades.
</p>
<p>
But climate change is expected to make dry years drier and wet years
wetter, creating a “hydroclimate whiplash,” as Daniel Swain, a
pre-eminent expert on climate change and weather in California puts it.
In a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lfdot3l5dm2o" target="_blank"><u>thread
on Bluesky</u></a>, Swain wrote that “in 2024, Southern California
experienced an exceptional episode of wet-to-dry hydroclimate whiplash.”
Last year’s rainy winter fostered abundant plant growth, and the
proceeding dryness primed the vegetation for fire.

sunlight is 10 times more intense at the top of the atmosphere than on
Earth’s surface, but “in order to generate optimal, economically-viable
levels of solar power, the required structures need to be very large,
both on Earth and in space.” NASA noted that researchers would need to
figure out how to build these large structures in orbit, then make sure

id="judge-sentences-donald-trump-in-hush-money-case-no-punishment-imposed">Judge
sentences Donald Trump in hush money case, no punishment imposed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced Friday in his
hush money case, but the judge declined to impose any punishment, an
outcome that cements his conviction but frees him to return to the White
House unencumbered by the threat of a jail term or a fine.</p>
<p>Trump’s sentence of an unconditional discharge caps a norm-smashing
case that saw the former and future president charged with 34 felonies,
put on trial for almost two months and convicted by a jury on every
count. Yet, the legal detour — and sordid details aired in court of a
plot to bury affair allegations — didn’t hurt him with voters, who
elected him to a second term.</p>
<p>Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan could have sentenced the 78-year-old
Republican to up to four years in prison. Instead, he chose a sentence
that sidestepped thorny constitutional issues by effectively ending the
case but assured that Trump will become the first person convicted of a
felony to assume the presidency.</p>
<p>Merchan said that, like when facing any other defendant, he must
consider any aggravating factors before imposing a sentence, but the
legal protection that Trump will have as president “is a factor that
overrides all others.”</p>
<p>“Despite the extraordinary breadth of those legal protections, one
power they do not provide is that they do not erase a jury verdict,”
Merchan said.</p>
<p>WATCH: Donald Trump sentenced without penalties in New York court</p>
<p>Trump, briefly addressing the court as he appeared virtually from his
Florida home, said his criminal trial and conviction has “been a very
terrible experience” and insisted he committed no crime.</p>
<p>The Republican former president, appearing on a video feed 10 days
before he is inaugurated, again pilloried the case, the only one of his
four criminal indictments that has gone to trial and possibly the only
one that ever will.</p>
<p>“It’s been a political witch hunt. It was done to damage my
reputation so that I would lose the election, and obviously, that didn’t
work,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump called the case “a weaponization of government” and “an
embarrassment to New York.”</p>
<p>With Trump 10 days from inauguration, Merchan had indicated he
planned a no-penalty sentence called an unconditional discharge, and
prosecutors didn’t oppose it.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Friday that they supported a no-penalty sentence,
but they chided Trump’s attacks on the legal system throughout and after
the case.</p>
<p>“The once and future president of the United States has engaged in a
coordinated campaign to undermine its legitimacy,” prosecutor Joshua
Steinglass said.</p>
<p>Rather than show remorse, Trump has “bred disdain” for the jury
verdict and the criminal justice system, Steinglass said, and his calls
for retaliation against those involved in the case, including calling
for the judge to be disbarred, “has caused enduring damage to public
perception of the criminal justice system and has put officers of the
court in harm’s way.”</p>
<p>As he appeared from his Florida home, the former president was seated
with his lawyer Todd Blanche, whom he’s tapped to serve as the
second-highest ranking Justice Department official in his incoming
administration.</p>
<p>“Legally, this case should not have been brought,” Blanche said,
reiterating Trump’s intention to appeal the verdict. That technically
can’t happen until he’s sentenced.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, becomes the first person convicted of a felony
to assume the presidency.</p>
<p>The judge had indicated that he planned the unconditional discharge —
a rarity in felony convictions — partly to avoid complicated
constitutional issues that would have arisen if he imposed a penalty
that overlapped with Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>The hush money case accused Trump of fudging his business’ records to
veil a $130,000 payoff to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She was paid, late
in Trump’s 2016 campaign, not to tell the public about a sexual
encounter she maintains the two had a decade earlier. He says nothing
sexual happened between them, and he contends that his political
adversaries spun up a bogus prosecution to try to damage him.</p>
<p>“I never falsified business records. It is a fake, made up charge,”
the Republican president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform last
week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office brought the
charges, is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Bragg’s office said in a court filing Monday that Trump committed
“serious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the
electoral process and to the integrity of New York’s financial
marketplace.”</p>
<p>While the specific charges were about checks and ledgers, the
underlying accusations were seamy and deeply entangled with Trump’s
political rise. Prosecutors said Daniels was paid off — through Trump’s
personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen — as part of a wider effort
to keep voters from hearing about Trump’s alleged extramarital
escapades.</p>
<p>Trump denies the alleged encounters occurred. His lawyers said he
wanted to squelch the stories to protect his family, not his campaign.
And while prosecutors said Cohen’s reimbursements for paying Daniels
were deceptively logged as legal expenses, Trump says that’s simply what
they were.</p>
<p>“There was nothing else it could have been called,” he wrote on Truth
Social last week, adding, “I was hiding nothing.”</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers tried unsuccessfully to forestall a trial. Since his
May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, they have
pulled virtually every legal lever within reach to try to get the
conviction overturned, the case dismissed or at least the sentencing
postponed.</p>
<p>The Trump attorneys have leaned heavily into assertions of
presidential immunity from prosecution, and they got a boost in July
from a Supreme Court decision that affords former commanders-in-chief
considerable immunity.</p>
<p>Trump was a private citizen and presidential candidate when Daniels
was paid in 2016. He was president when the reimbursements to Cohen were
made and recorded the following year.</p>
<p>On one hand, Trump’s defense argued that immunity should have kept
jurors from hearing some evidence, such as testimony about some of his
conversations with then-White House communications director Hope
Hicks.</p>
<p>And after Trump won this past November’s election, his lawyers argued
that the case had to be scrapped to avoid impinging on his upcoming
presidency and his transition to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Merchan, a Democrat, repeatedly postponed the sentencing, initially
set for July. But last week, he set Friday’s date, citing a need for
“finality.” He wrote that he strove to balance Trump’s need to govern,
the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, the respect due a jury verdict and
the public’s expectation that “no one is above the law.”</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to
block the sentencing. Their last hope vanished Thursday night with a 5-4
Supreme Court ruling that declined to delay the sentencing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other criminal cases that once loomed over Trump have
ended or stalled ahead of trial.</p>

id="wildfires-still-burning-in-los-angeles-death-toll-rises-to-11">Wildfires
still burning in Los Angeles; death toll rises to 11</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters in Los Angeles battled flames for a fourth straight day
on Friday, trying to get the upper hand on wildfires that have destroyed
thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people.</p>
<p>Officials have warned that the death toll, updated late Thursday,
could increase once the multiple fires have been brought under control
and workers can comb through the ruins.</p>
<p>Firefighting operations continued overnight into Friday morning, with
water-dropping helicopters taking advantage of a temporary lull in the
winds.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden convened key officials Friday to discuss the
federal government’s response to the wildfires.</p>
<p>“We have an awful lot of experience with this stuff, unfortunately,”
Biden later told reporters Friday. “Climate change has been real. It’s
been real for the last four years of our administration. We’ve seen
devastating impacts.”</p>
<p>As of Friday morning, the largest blaze, the Palisades fire, was only
8% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection. It has burned through more than 8,000 hectares of
land.</p>
<p>The second-largest blaze, the Eaton fire, was 3% contained, according
to the department. That one has burned through nearly 6,000 hectares of
land.</p>
<p>The Palisades and Eaton fires already rank as the most destructive in
Los Angeles history. Together, they have burned through about 85 square
kilometers of land and destroyed or damaged about 10,000 structures.</p>
<p>“It looks like an atomic bomb dropped in these areas,” Los Angeles
County Sheriff Robert Luna said at a Thursday news conference.</p>
<p>Deanne Criswell, FEMA administrator, told reporters at the White
House via video call from California that winds were forecast to pick up
again after a pause Friday.</p>
<p>Biden told reporters Friday that his administration was coordinating
with the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has faulted Biden and California
Governor Gavin Newsom for the crisis. “He is the blame for this,” Trump
wrote about Newsom on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump claimed California’s water policies are to blame for the fires,
but the Los Angeles area is experiencing extremely dry conditions and
fierce Santa Ana winds.</p>
<p>Trump demanded that Newsom “open up the water main” in Northern
California to send water south, but there is no such central water valve
in the state. Local officials have said the overall water supply is not
the problem; rather, it’s that power was shut off to pumps around the
fires.</p>
<p>At a news briefing Friday afternoon, White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre rebuked criticism of the emergency response to the
fires.</p>
<p>“It is on all of us to show these people, to show folks in California
some compassion, as they are reckoning with an unimaginable disaster,”
she said.</p>
<p>Biden told a White House briefing Thursday afternoon that federal
resources and additional funding have been made available to California
to fight the wildfires that he described as the “worst fires to ever hit
Los Angeles.”</p>
<p>The money will be used, the president said, to cover all the costs
for 180 days for temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials,
first responder salaries, and measures to protect life.</p>
<p>“I told the governor, local officials, spare no expense to do what
they need to do and contain these fires,” Biden said Thursday.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator for California,
spoke at the briefing, describing the situation in California as
“apocalyptic” and “something that is going to have an impact for months
and years to come.”</p>
<p>Authorities said the wildfires burning in and around Los Angeles
prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people, destroyed thousands of
homes, and burned tens of thousands of hectares of land.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely an unprecedented, historic firestorm,” Los
Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said.</p>
<p>Bass has faced criticism for being absent from Los Angeles when the
Palisades fire erupted Tuesday. She was in Ghana attending the
inauguration of President John Dramani Mahama as part of a U.S.
presidential delegation.</p>
<p>Bass returned the following day. On Thursday, she highlighted the
“unprecedented” nature of the fires and defended her leadership.</p>
<p>“My focus right now is on the lives and the homes,” Bass said.</p>
<p>At a news briefing Thursday, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley
told reporters the fierce winds that had driven the fires calmed enough
to allow firefighters to increase containment and air operations to
resume.</p>
<p>Cal Fire is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area:
the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Kenneth fires.</p>
<p>As of Friday morning, the Kenneth fire was 35% contained, the Hurst
fire was 37% contained, and the Lidia fire was 75% contained, according
to CAL FIRE.</p>
<p>Los Angeles firefighters achieved 100% containment of the Sunset fire
on Thursday. That fire triggered mandatory evacuation orders in
Hollywood and the Hollywood Hills.</p>
<p>Troops from the California National Guard arrived Friday morning to
secure the fire zone in Altadena from theft. At least 20 people have
been arrested for looting in devasted neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“I promise you, you will be held accountable,” Los Angeles County
Supervisor Kathryn Barger said at a news conference Thursday.</p>
<p>“Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of
crisis,” Barger said, according to The Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>Ash and smoke from the fires have put at least 17 million people in
the Los Angeles area under air quality advisories. The air quality index
reached 173 in the area; good air quality is 50 or less on the
index.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, California’s insurance commissioner blocked insurance
companies from canceling or not renewing the policies of customers in
the areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires for a one-year period.
Concerns have increased that this week’s fires could hasten the flow of
insurers out of California.</p>

court declines to block release of one special counsel report on
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A U.S. appeals court on Thursday declined to block the U.S. Justice
Department from releasing a special counsel’s investigative report on
President-elect Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat in the
2020 election.</p>
<p>The ruling from the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th
Circuit appeared to clear the way for the release of the report as early
as next week.</p>
<p>The appeals court’s decision did not immediately lift an order from
U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon earlier this week pausing the release
of the report. But Cannon set her order to expire three days after the
appeals court ruled on the issue.</p>
<p>The appeals court invited the Justice Department to bring a separate
appeal if it wished to reverse that ruling.</p>
<p>The report is likely to be the final act from special counsel Jack
Smith, who brought two historic cases against Trump for attempting to
subvert the 2020 election results and for mishandling classified
documents.</p>
<p>Smith dropped both cases after Trump’s election victory and neither
reached a trial.</p>
<p>Thursday’s ruling came after Trump’s two former co-defendants in the
classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, asked the
appeals court to block the release of the report, arguing it would
interfere with their ongoing prosecution.</p>
<p>The report for now is set to detail only the 2020 election probe
after Attorney General Merrick Garland, who appointed Smith, decided not
to publicly release the portion focused on the classified documents
while legal proceedings against Trump’s two former co-defendants
continue.</p>
<p>The Justice Department plans to allow only certain senior members of
Congress to review that section of the report, the department said in a
court filing.</p>
<p>Nauta and De Oliveira argued that even the limited release of the
documents section of the report to Congress could harm their defense
against obstruction charges. Both have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>It is unclear how much new information the public portion of the
report will contain. Smith and a House of Representatives panel have
already released detailed accounts of Trump’s actions surrounding the
2020 election, including during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the cases against
him were part of an effort to damage his political campaign.</p>

releases resources to fight wildfires, shelter victims in
California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said at a White House briefing Thursday
afternoon that federal resources and additional funding have been made

also spoke at the briefing.</p>
<p>Harris described the situation in California as “apocalyptic” and
“something that is going to have an impact for months and years to
come.”</p>
<p>The vice president has a home in an evacuation zone, but it was not
immediately clear whether her house sustained any damage.</p>
<p>While the death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires stands at five,
Southern California officials say that number will likely increase once
the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through
the ruins.</p>
<p>Authorities said the wildfires burning in and around the city of Los
Angeles have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people, destroyed
thousands of homes, and burned tens of thousands of hectares of
land.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely an unprecedented, historic firestorm,” Los
Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said.</p>
<p>At a news briefing Thursday, Los Angeles city and county officials
provided an update on the fires and the efforts to bring them under
control.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the fierce
winds that had driven the fires calmed enough to allow firefighters to
increase containment and air operations to resume.</p>
<p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it is
fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area: the Palisades,
Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Sunset fires, with the Palisades and Eaton fires
being the largest.</p>
<p>The sparking of a sixth fire — the Kenneth Fire, near Woodland Hills
— was announced Thursday, and a mandatory evacuation order was in effect
for that area, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.</p>
<p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in its
last report that the fires had burned more than 11,750 hectares of land,
an announcement made before the addition of the Kenneth Fire.</p>
<p>Some people are apparently preying on the devastated neighborhoods,
and at least 20 people have been arrested in recent days for
looting.</p>
<p>“I promise you, you will be held accountable,” Los Angeles Supervisor
Kathryn Barger said at a press conference Thursday.</p>
<p>“Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of

<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said the Palisades, Eaton,
Hurst and Lidia fires have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000
residents, and another 200,000 residents are under evacuation
orders.</p>
<p>Fire Chief Crowley called the Palisades Fire alone “one of the most
destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles.” Officials
said Thursday that more than 5,000 homes and other structures have been
lost in Palisades.</p>
<p>A leading national credit rating service echoed that view. In a
statement Thursday, Morningstar-DBRS credit service said preliminary
estimates show the fires could result in more than $8 billion in
property losses.</p>
<p>Citing local fire officials, Morningstar-DBRS said the fires have
already destroyed more than 1,100 homes and threaten more than 28,000
structures. The organization, which monitors and evaluates risk, said it
expects the wildfires to have an adverse but manageable impact on
California property insurers.</p>

refutes Trump attacks, pledges federal aid to fight California
fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said wildfires ravaging Los Angeles
show climate change is real, days before President-elect Donald Trump is
to take office. Trump has threatened to pull back on U.S. efforts to
combat global warming.</p>
<p>“Climate change is real. … There is global warming, it’s real,” Biden
told a crisis meeting at the White House on the fires.</p>
<p>“This is the most widespread, devastating fire in California’s
history,” Biden said as he convened the meeting.</p>
<p>Trump has used the wildfires to attack Biden and California
Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on social media.</p>
<p>The outgoing president canceled a trip to Rome to stay in Washington
and coordinate the U.S. government response to the fires, which have
killed at least five people.</p>
<p>He said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of
dealing with the disaster for the first 180 days, at Newsom’s
request.</p>
<p>Biden said he was surging 400 federal firefighters and 30
firefighting planes and helicopters to Los Angeles, while the Pentagon
will send eight large planes and 500 wildfire clearance personnel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden sought to debunk claims pushed by Trump that there
was a water shortage that left firefighters struggling to put out the
inferno.</p>
<p>Biden said the problem lay not with a shortage of water but with
power cuts that took water pumps offline. During wildfires, utility
companies can cut electricity amid fears that faulty power lines could
spark more fires.</p>
<p>Trump’s remarks on Wednesday and Thursday came as firefighters were
trying to contain the blazes that have killed five people and destroyed
more than 2,000 structures.</p>
<p>“One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of
America is burning down to the ground,” Trump said on his Truth Social
network late Wednesday, blaming the fires on Newsom and calling on him
to resign.</p>
<p>Trump returned to the subject Thursday morning as the blazes
continued to rage. Without providing evidence, he variously accused
Newsom of “incompetence” in managing the fires and of wasting water in
drought-hit California.</p>
<p>The California governor strongly rejected Trump’s claims in an
interview with CNN.</p>
<p>“People are literally fleeing. … This guy wanted to politicize it. I
have a lot of thoughts, and I know what I want to say. I won’t,” Newsom
said.</p>
<p>Trump accused Biden on Thursday of diverting money to “Green New
Scam” climate policies instead of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.</p>
<p>Biden has repeatedly denied steering funds away from FEMA, including
in October when Trump made similar accusations after hurricanes
devastated the U.S. Southeast a month before the 2024 U.S. presidential
election.</p>
<p>California has long been a target of Trump’s ire, with the most
populous U.S. state long having voted for Democrats. He made some modest
gains in the 2024 election.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance said Thursday
that he would resign from his U.S. Senate seat from Ohio at midnight
ahead of his inauguration later this month.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump and Vance defeated the Democratic
presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running
mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Vance’s Senate seat will be filled by a person appointed by Ohio
Republican Governor Mike DeWine. The replacement will serve until a
special election is held in November 2026. The winner of that election
will finish the remainder of Vance’s Senate term, which ends in January
2029.</p>
<p>In his resignation letter to the Ohio governor, Vance wrote that “it
has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio in
the Senate over the past two years.”</p>
<p>Republicans won a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives in the November elections.</p>

Recovering from the Los Angeles wildfires will be expensive.
<em><em>Really</em></em> expensive. Insurance analysts and banks have
already produced a wide range of estimates of both what insurance
companies will pay out and overall economic loss.
AccuWeather<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/california-wildfires-52-57b-damage-estimate-accuweather-report/1731718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>has put out an eye-catching preliminary figure of $52 billion to $57
billion</u></a> for economic losses, with the service’s chief
meteorologist saying that the fires have the potential to “become the
worst wildfire in modern California history based on the number of
structures burned and economic loss.” On Thursday, J.P. Morgan doubled
its previous estimate for insured losses
<a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/la-wildfire-insured-losses-could-exceed-20bn-j-p-morgan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
$20 billion</u></a>, with an economic loss figure of $50 billion — about
the gross domestic product of the country of Jordan.
</p>
<p>
The startlingly high loss figures from a fire that has only lasted a few
days and is (relatively) limited in scope show just how distinctly
devastating an urban fire can be. Enormous wildfires
that<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151985/tracking-canadas-extreme-2023-fire-season" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>cover millions of acres</u></a> like the 2023 Canadian wildfires can
spew ash and particulate matter all over the globe and burn for months,
darkening skies and clogging airways in other countries. And smaller —
and far deadlier fires — than those still do not produce the same
financial roll.
</p>
<p>
It’s in coastal Southern California where you find large population
centers areas known by all to be at extreme risk of fire. And so a fire
there can destroy a whole neighborhood in a few hours and put the
state’s insurance system
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>into
jeopardy</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
One reason why the projected economic impacts of the fires are so high
is that the structures that have burned and the land those structures
sit on are very valuable. Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Santa Monica
contain some of the most sought-after real estate on planet earth, with
typical home prices over $2 million. Pacific Palisades itself has median
home values of around $3 million, according to JPMorgan Chase.
</p>
<p>
The AccuWeather estimates put the economic damage for the Los Angeles
fires at several times previous large, urban fires — the Maui wildfire
in 2023 was estimated to cause around $14 billion of economic loss, for
example — while the figure would be about a third or a quarter of a
large hurricane, which tend to strike areas with millions of people in
them across several states.
</p>
<p>
“The fires have not been contained thus far and continue to spread,
implying that estimates of potential economic and insured losses are
likely to increase,” the JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday.

That level of losses would make the fires costlier in economic terms
than the 2018 Butte County Camp Fire, whose insured losses of $10
billion made it California’s costliest at the time. That fire was far
larger than the Los Angeles fires, spreading over 150,000 acres compared
to just over 17,000 acres for the Palisades Fire and over 10,000 acres
for the Eaton Fire. It also led to more than 80 deaths in the town of
Paradise.
</p>
<p>
So far, around 2,000 homes have been
destroyed,<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" target="_blank">
<u>according to the </u><u><em><em>Los Angeles
Times</em></em></u></a>,<a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/fire-research-division-73300/wildland-urban-interface-fire-73305/nist-investigation-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>a fraction of the
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/fire-research-division-73300/wildland-urban-interface-fire-73305/nist-investigation-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 19,000 structures</u></a> affected by the Camp Fire. The difference
in estimated losses comes from the fact that homes in Pacific Palisades
weigh in at more than six times those in rural Butte, according to
JPMorgan.
</p>
<p>
While insured losses get the lion’s share of attention when it comes to
the cost impacts of a natural disaster, the potential damages go far
beyond the balance sheet of insurers.
</p>
<p>
For one, it’s likely that many affected homeowners did not even carry
insurance, either because their insurers failed to renew their existing
policies or the homeowners simply chose to go without due to the high
cost of what insurance they could find. “A larger than usual portion of
the losses caused by the wildfires will be uninsured,” according to
<a href="https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/445636" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Morningstar
DBRS</u></a>, which estimated total insured losses at more than $8
billion. Many homeowners carry insurance from California’s backup FAIR
Plan, which may itself come under financial pressure, potentially
leading to assessments from the state’s policyholders to bolster its
ability to pay claims.
</p>
<p>
AccuWeather arrived at its economic impact figure by looking not just at
losses from property damage but also wages that go unearned due to
economic activity slowing down or halting in affected areas,
infrastructure that needs to be repaired, supply chain issues, and
transportation snarls. Even when homes and businesses aren’t destroyed,
people may be unable to work due to evacuations; businesses may close
due to the dispersal of their customers or inability of their suppliers
to make deliveries.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-wildfire-smoke-study" target="_self"><u>Smoke
inhalation</u></a> can lead to short-, medium-, and long-term health
impacts that take a dent out of overall economic activity.
</p>
<p>
The high level of insured losses, meanwhile, could mean that insurers’
will see less surplus and could have to pay more for reinsurance, Nancy
Watkins, an actuary and wildfire expert at Milliman, told me in an
email. This may mean that they would have to shed yet more policies “in
order to avoid deterioration in their financial strength ratings,” just
as California has been trying to lure insurers back with reforms to its
dysfunctional insurance market.
</p>
<p>
The economic costs of the fire will likely be felt for years if not
decades. While it would take an act of God far stronger than a fire to
keep people from building homes on the slopes of the Santa Monica
Mountains or off the Pacific Coast, the city that rebuilds may be
smaller, more heavily fortified, and more expensive than the one that
existed at the end of last year. And that’s just before the next big
fire.

‘observing’ Greenland situation; Europe cautious on Trump remarks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>london — Russia has said it is closely watching the situation with
Greenland, following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s refusal to rule
out military or economic measures to take control of the territory from
Denmark.</p>
<p>“We are observing this rather dramatic development of the situation,
but so far, thank God, [it remains] at the level of statements,” Kremlin
spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The Arctic zone is a zone of our national and strategic interests.
We are present in the Arctic zone, and we will continue to be there,”
Peskov added.</p>
<p>The vast territory of Greenland — most of which lies above the Arctic
Circle — has been officially part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1953,
although the island has its own government.</p>
<p>National security</p>
<p>Questioned at a news conference in Florida on Tuesday, Trump said the
United States needs Greenland for security purposes, and he refused to
rule out using economic or military means to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>“People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it.
But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national
security. That’s for the free world. I’m talking about protecting the
free world,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“You have Chinese ships all over the place. You have Russian ships
all over the place. We’re not letting that happen,” he added.</p>
<p>Like much of the Arctic, Greenland is rapidly warming. That is
changing the geopolitics of the region, said analyst Liana Fix of the
Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“The Arctic is increasingly becoming a zone of a great power
competition and rivalry. And the United States is concerned it is losing
this game,” Fix said.</p>
<p>“The Arctic becomes much more accessible, both for trading goods but
also for critical minerals, especially for rare earth [minerals],” Fix
said. “And also it becomes increasingly a militarized zone,” she added,
noting that Russia is cooperating with the Chinese coast guard in the
region.</p>
<p>Not for sale</p>
<p>Denmark has made it clear that Greenland is not for sale. Foreign
Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen rejected the suggestion that Trump’s
comments presented a foreign policy crisis for his government.</p>
<p>“I see a president who is on his way into the White House, who has a
heightened focus on the Arctic, and I can understand that he has that.
We also have that from the Danish side, and we also have that within
NATO,” Rasmussen said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Denmark faces a dilemma, said analyst Fix.</p>
<p>“It is very clear for Denmark, too, that increased cooperation with
the United States both on investments in Greenland but also on military
cooperation would be actually in the interest of everyone,” Fix told
VOA.</p>
<p>Several European leaders rejected Trump’s comments, although most
stopped short of directly criticizing the incoming U.S. president.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said basic Western values were at
stake.</p>
<p>“The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country,
regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,” he said.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was more direct. “It is out
of the question for the European Union to let any nation in the world,
whichever it is — and let me say starting with Russia — define its
sovereign borders,” he said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Greenland independence</p>
<p>Greenland’s government, meanwhile, is pushing for a referendum on
full independence and has said that only the people will decide
Greenland’s future.</p>
<p>“Greenland is on its way into a new era and a new year in which
Greenland has been at the center of world attention. The Greenlandic
people are one people, regardless of where they live. And as people in
the times we live in, we must be united in order to be ready for a new
future that our country is on its way to,” Prime Minister Mute Egede
said during a trip to Copenhagen on Thursday.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
A fire needs three things to burn: heat, fuel, and oxygen. The first is
important: At some point this week, for a reason
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-started-los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>we
have yet to discover</u></a> and may never will, a piece of flammable
material in Los Angeles County got hot enough to ignite. The last is
essential: The resulting fires, which have now burned nearly 29,000
acres, are fanned by exceptionally powerful and dry
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Santa
Ana winds</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But in the critical days ahead, it is that central ingredient that will
preoccupy fire managers, emergency responders, and the public, who are
watching their homes — wood-framed containers full of memories, primary
documents, material wealth, sentimental heirlooms — transformed into raw
fuel. “Grass is one fuel model; timber is another fuel model; brushes
are another — there are dozens of fuel models,” Bobbie Scopa, a veteran
firefighter and author of the memoir
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781641608060" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Both
Sides of the Fire Line</em></em></u></a>, told me. “But when a fire goes
from the wildland into the urban interface, you’re now burning houses.”
</p>
<p>
This jump from chaparral shrubland into neighborhoods has frustrated
firefighters’ efforts to gain an upper hand over the L.A. County fires.
In the remote wilderness, firefighters can cut fire lines with axes,
pulaskis, and shovels to contain the blaze. (A fire’s “containment”
describes how much firefighters have encircled; 25% containment means a
quarter of the fire perimeter is prevented from moving forward by
manmade or natural fire breaks.)
</p>
<p>
Once a fire moves into an urban community and starts spreading house to
house, however, as has already happened in Santa Monica, Pasadena, and
other suburbs of Los Angeles, those strategies go out the window. A fire
break starves a fire by introducing a gap in its fuel; it can be a
cleared strip of vegetation, a river, or even a freeway. But you can’t
just hack a fire break through a neighborhood. “Now you’re having to use
big fire engines and spray lots of water,” Scopa said, compared to the
wildlands where “we do a lot of firefighting without water.”
</p>
<p>
Water has already proven to be a significant issue in Los Angeles, where
many hydrants near Palisades, the biggest of the five fires, had already
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/lack-of-water-from-hydrants-in-palisades-fire-is-hampering-firefighters-caruso-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gone
dry by 3:00 a.m. Wednesday</u></a>. “We’re fighting a wildfire with
urban water systems, and that is really challenging,” Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power CEO Janisse Quiñones explained in a news
conference later that same day.
</p>
<p>
LADWP
<a href="https://www.ladwpnews.com/ladwp-windstorm-response-update-wednesday-january-8/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
it had filled its 114 water storage tanks
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>before
the fires started</u></a>, but the city’s water supply was never
intended to stop a 17,000-acre fire. The hydrants are “meant to put out
a two-house fire, a one-house fire, or something like that,” Faith
Kearns, a water and wildfire researcher at Arizona State University,
told me. Additionally, homeowners sometimes leave their sprinklers on in
the hopes that it will help protect their house, or
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cali-wildfire-victim-found-dead-with-hose-in-hand-after-defending-family-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>try
to fight fires with their own hoses</u></a>. At a certain point, the
system — just like the city personnel — becomes overwhelmed by the sheer
magnitude of the unfolding disaster.
</p>
<p>
Making matters worse is the wind, which restricted some of the aerial
support firefighters typically employ. As gusts slowed on Thursday,
retardant and water drops were able to resume, helping firefighters in
their efforts. (The Eaton Fire, while still technically 0% contained
because there are no established fire lines, has “significantly stopped”
growing,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/09/us/california-fires-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
New York Times </em></em></u><u>reports</u></a>). Still, firefighters
don’t typically “paint” neighborhoods; the drops, which don’t put out
fires entirely so much as suppress them enough that firefighters can
fight them at close range, are a liability. Kearns, however, told me
that “the winds were so high, they weren’t able to do the water drops
that they normally do and that are an enormous part of all fire
operations,” and that “certainly compounded the problems of the fire
hydrants running dry.”
</p>
<p>
Firefighters’ priority isn’t saving structures, though. “Firefighters
save lives first before they have to deal with fire,” Alexander
Maranghides, a fire protection engineer at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology and the author of
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/case-study-camp-fire-notification-evacuation-traffic-and-temporary-refuge-areas-nettra" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
ongoing case study</u></a> of the 2018 Camp fire in Paradise,
California, told me. That can be an enormous and time-consuming task in
a dense area like suburban Los Angeles, and counterintuitively lead to
more areas burning down. Speaking specifically from his conclusions
about the Camp fire, which was similarly a wildland-urban interface, or
WUI fire, Maranghides added, “It is very, very challenging because as
things deteriorate — you’re talking about downed power lines, smoke
obstructing visibility, and you end up with burn-overs,” when a fire
moves so quickly that it overtakes people or fire crews. “And now you
have to go and rescue those civilians who are caught in those
burn-overs.” Sometimes, that requires firefighters to do triage — and
let blocks burn to save lives.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most ominously, the problems don’t end once the fire is out.
When a house burns down, it is often the case that its water pipes
burst. (This also adds to the water shortage woes during the event.) But
when firefighters are simultaneously pumping water out of other parts of
the system, air can be sucked down into those open water pipes. And not
just <em><em>any</em></em> air. “We’re not talking about forest smoke,
which is bad; we’re talking about WUI smoke, which is bad
<em><em>plus,</em></em>” Maranghides said, again referring to his
research in Paradise. “It’s not just wood burning; it’s wood, plastics,
heavy metals, computers, cars, batteries, everything. You don’t want to
be breathing it, and you don’t want it going into your water system.”
</p>
<p>
Water infrastructure can be damaged in other ways, as well. Because
fires are burning “so much hotter now,” Kearns told me, contamination

<p>The claim that NATO allies under-contribute to global security is
misleading. While 23 of 32 members met the 2 percent GDP defense target,
actual contributions vary significantly. Instead of focusing solely on
spending, assessing what each ally brings to the table is crucial for

id="carter-funeral-brings-together-1-current-4-ex-presidents-to-honor-one-of-their-own">Carter
funeral brings together 1 current, 4 ex-presidents to honor one of their
own</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As they filed into the front pews at the National
Cathedral, wearing dark suits and mostly solemn faces, one current and
four former presidents came together for Jimmy Carter’s funeral. For a
service that stretched more than an hour, the feuding, grievances and
enmity that had marked their rival campaigns and divergent politics gave
way to a reverential moment for one of their own.</p>
<p>Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two of the group to take
their seats Thursday, shook hands and chatted at length. Trump, the
former president who will retake the Oval Office in 11 days, leaned in
and listened intently to his predecessor. At times, the two flashed
smiles.</p>
<p>Obama, who attended without his wife, Michelle, shared a second-row
pew with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with
their spouses. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived
last and sat in the pew just in front of them.</p>
<p>Members of the exclusive presidents’ club were on their best
behavior. Bonded by the presidency, they rarely criticize one another or
the White House’s current occupant — although Trump has flouted those
rules frequently. He has praised and criticized Carter in recent days,
and he complained that flags will still be at half-staff to honor the
deceased president during his inauguration.</p>
<p>Trump looked up when Vice President Kamala Harris — whom he defeated
in November’s hard-fought election — entered the cathedral, but he
didn’t move to greet her as she and husband Doug Emhoff took seats
directly in front of him and Melania Trump. Nor did Harris acknowledge
him.</p>
<p>After the service, Emhoff turned around to shake hands with
Trump.</p>
<p>Obama, with Trump on his left, also turned to his right to chat with
Bush. Clinton, with wife Hillary, was the last of the ex-presidents to
take a seat and got in some chatter with Bush as well.</p>
<p>The White House said the former presidents also met privately before
taking their seats.</p>
<p>Funerals are among the few events that bring members of the
presidents’ club together. In a way, former President Gerald Ford was
there, too: Ford’s son Steven read a eulogy for Carter that Ford had
written before he died in 2006.</p>
<p>Busy with personal pursuits, charitable endeavors and sometimes
lucrative speaking gigs, the former leaders don’t mingle often. They all
know the protocol of state funerals well — each has been involved in
planning his own.</p>
<p>During the 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, then-President Trump
sat with his predecessors and their spouses, including the Carters, and
the interactions were stiff and sometimes awkward.</p>
<p>This time, Trump also didn’t appear to interact with Hillary Clinton,
whom he defeated in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Trump was seated in the pew in front of his former vice president,
Mike Pence — one of the few times they have coincided at events since
Pence refused to overturn the results of the 2020 election after Trump
lost to Biden. The two shook hands but didn’t speak much beyond
that.</p>
<p>Trump, who largely avoided contact with the former presidents during
his first term — and pointedly did not seek their advice — has been
critical of Republican former presidents, particularly the Bush family,
which made him an uneasy member of the former presidents’ club. Carter
himself didn’t particularly relish being a member of the club, at times
criticizing its staid traditions.</p>
<p>Many past presidents have built relationships with their
predecessors, including Bill Clinton, who reached out to Richard Nixon
for advice on Russian policy, and Harry Truman, who sought counsel from
Herbert Hoover.</p>
<p>One of the first calls Obama made after U.S. forces killed Osama bin
Laden in 2011 was to George W. Bush to spread the word that the mission
had been accomplished, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of Team of
Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump.</p>
<p>“It’s the loneliest job in the world, so usually they reach out and
rely on each other,” said Andersen Brower. “But Trump didn’t have that
the first term, so this will just be another four years where he doesn’t
depend on anyone who came before him.”</p>
<p>She noted that Carter spent years as a proud Washington outsider and
skipped the unveiling of his own portrait to avoid being in the same
room with the man who beat him in 1980, President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>“Carter and Trump, even though they have the least in common about
everything else, are similar,” Andersen Brower said, “in just how they
approach telling what they actually think.”</p>

id="worst-in-show-ces-products-put-data-at-risk-and-cause-waste-privacy-advocates-say">‘Worst
in Show’ CES products put data at risk and cause waste, privacy
advocates say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — So much of the technology showcased at CES includes
gadgets made to improve consumers’ lives — whether by leveraging AI to
make devices that help people become more efficient, by creating
companions to cure loneliness, or by providing tools that help people
with mental and physical health. </p>
<p>But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of
self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as “Worst
in Show.” The award that no company wants to win calls out the “least
repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on
display.” </p>
<p>“We’re seeing more and more of these things that have basically
surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool
things,” Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce
site iFixit told The Associated Press. “But it also means that now we’ve
got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and
that really is an industry-wide problem.” </p>
<p>The fourth annual contest announced its decisions Thursday. </p>
<p>A new smart ring every few years? </p>
<p>Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart
Ring the title of “least repairable.” </p>
<p>The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost
$2,200. Wiens said the jewelry “looks sleek but hides a major flaw: its
battery only lasts 500 charges.” Worse, he said, is the fact that
replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device
entirely. </p>
<p>“Luxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a
new low,” he said. </p>
<p>Ultrahuman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>An AI-powered smart crib? </p>
<p>Bosch’s “Revol” crib uses sensors, cameras and AI that the company
says can help monitor vital signs like how an infant is sleeping, heart
and respiratory rates and more. The crib can also rock gently if the
baby needs help falling asleep and signal to parents if a blanket or
other object is interfering with breathing. </p>
<p>EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn said the crib preys on parents’
fears and “collects excessive data about babies via a camera,
microphone, and even a radar sensor.” </p>
<p>“Parents expect safety and comfort — not surveillance and privacy
risks — in their children’s cribs,” she said in the report. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Bosch told The Associated Press that all data is
encrypted end-to-end and stored on Bosch-administered servers, “while
all data at rest is secured locally with individual data encryption
keys.” </p>
<p>“Caregivers have the final say on whether data is transmitted at all.
The Revol has an offline mode, which keeps data local if preferred,” the
spokesperson said, adding that the smart crib helps keep children
safe. </p>
<p>Too much waste? </p>
<p>Although AI is everywhere at CES, Stacey Higginbotham, a policy
Fellow at Consumer Reports, felt that SoundHound AI’s In-Car Commerce
Ecosystem, powered by its Automotive AI, pushes it to unnecessary
extremes. </p>
<p>The feature “increases energy consumption, encourages wasteful
takeout consumption and distracts drivers — all while adding little
value,” Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as “least
sustainable” on the list. </p>
<p>Soundhound AI’s platform allows drivers and passengers to order
takeout for pick-up directly from the car’s infotainment system. The
company did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement
Tuesday, Keyvan Mohajer, CEO of SoundHound AI, said the product’s launch
marks a moment “decades in the making.” </p>
<p>“What begins here with food and restaurants will ultimately open up a
whole new commercial ecosystem for vehicle and device manufacturers
everywhere,” he said. </p>
<p>Vulnerable to hacking? </p>
<p>TP-Link’s Archer BE900 router won for “least secure” of CES. The
company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are
vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security
Ledger. </p>
<p>“By Chinese law, TP-Link must report security flaws to the government
before alerting the public, creating a significant national security
risk,” he said. “Yet TP-Link showcased its Archer BE900 router at CES
without addressing these vulnerabilities.” </p>
<p>In an email response, TP-Link Systems contested the report. </p>
<p>“TP-Link Systems Inc. is a U.S.-headquartered company and does not
provide any such security reporting to China as referenced by iFixit,”
the company said. “TP-Link Systems has a secure, vertically-integrated,
and U.S.-owned international supply chain. Nearly all products sold in
the United States are manufactured in Vietnam.” </p>
<p>TP-Link said it controls its own supply chains, and “is constantly
assessing potential risks to its U.S. operations, customers, and supply
chain,” adding that it acknowledges that vulnerabilities exist across
the industry. </p>
<p>“However, contrary to claims of widespread vulnerabilities,
comparative data places TP-Link on par with, or in some cases ahead of,
other major industry players in terms of security outcomes,” the company
said. </p>
<p>Who asked for this? </p>
<p>The awards also feature a category called “who asked for this?” Top
of that list was Samsung’s Bespoke AI Washing Machine, which Nathan
Proctor, senior director of U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, said
is filled “with features no one needs,” including the ability to make
phone calls. </p>
<p>“These add-ons only make the appliance more expensive, fragile, and
harder to repair,” he said. </p>
<p>Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>At a press conference at CES Tuesday, Jong-Hee Han, vice chairman of
Samsung’s device experience division, said that he was “proud of how we
have introduced new technologies and intelligence to the home, connected
key devices and set the standard for the home of the future.” </p>
<p>“We are reinforcing our commitment to delivering personalized
experiences through our widespread implementation of AI and we will
continue this journey of AI leadership in the home and beyond, not just
for the next decade, but for the next century,” he said. </p>
<p>Worst overall </p>
<p>Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of The Repair Association,
called the LG “AI Home Inside 2.0 Refrigerator with ThinkQ” the worst
product overall. The fridge adds “flashy features,” Gordon-Byrne said,
including a screen and internet connection. </p>
<p>“But these come at a cost,” Gordon-Byrne said. “Shorter software
support, higher energy consumption, and expensive repairs reduce the
fridge’s practical lifespan, leaving consumers with an expensive,
wasteful gadget.” </p>
<p>LG did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

id="biden-administration-battles-on-against-plea-deal-for-accused-911-mastermind">Biden
administration battles on against plea deal for accused 9/11
mastermind</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration doubled down Thursday on its
unusual court battle to derail a plea deal that the government itself
had reached with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p>
<p>It urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed’s guilty plea from
going forward as scheduled Friday at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Defense
lawyers described the attempts to throw out the agreement as the latest
in two decades of “fitful” and “negligent” mishandling of the case by
the U.S. military and successive administrations.</p>
<p>The fight has put the Biden administration at odds with the U.S.
military officials it had appointed to oversee justice in al-Qaida’s
attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. It was the
latest tumult and uncertainty in two decades of troubled prosecution
tied to one of the deadliest attacks on American soil.</p>
<p>A new filing Thursday from Justice Department lawyers argued that the
gravity of the “extraordinarily important case” warranted Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin intervening to throw out the plea deal.</p>
<p>Asked about the appeal Thursday after a meeting in Germany with
allies about military support for Ukraine, Austin told reporters he had
not changed his mind on the matter and cited the court challenge in
declining further comment.</p>
<p>The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military
prosecutors and the Pentagon’s senior official for Guantanamo in late
July, would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants the risk of the death
penalty. It also obligates them to answer any lingering questions that
families of the victims have about the attacks.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys say that the plea agreements are already in effect
and that Austin has no legal authority to throw them out after the
fact.</p>
<p>At Guantanamo, preparations have moved ahead for Friday’s
proceedings, and family members of some of the victims already have
gathered. If the hearing goes forward, Mohammed would swear an oath in
the military courtroom and then defense attorney Gary Sowards would
enter pleas on his behalf to 2,976 counts of murder, along with other
charges.</p>
<p>Pleas by co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi would
follow later this month. Attorneys say months of sentencing hearings to
follow would give the government an opportunity to outline its case and
allow families to speak of their loss.</p>
<p>The federal appeals panel appears on track to rule Thursday on the
emergency request by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the
17 years since charges were filed against Mohammed, who prosecutors say
conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks. The case
remains in pretrial hearings, with no trial date set.</p>
<p>Years of defense and prosecution testimony have dragged on about how
much the torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders
their later statements unusable in court.</p>
<p>With that in mind, military prosecutors notified families of the
victims this summer that the senior Pentagon official overseeing
Guantanamo had approved a plea deal. They called it “the best path to
finality and justice.”</p>
<p>Austin unexpectedly announced on Aug. 2 that he was scrapping the
agreement. He argued that a decision on death penalties in an attack as
grave as Sept. 11 should be made only by the defense secretary.</p>
<p>The Biden administration went to the District of Columbia federal
appeals court this week after the Guantanamo judge and a military review
panel rejected Austin’s intervention.</p>
<p>Mohammed’s attorneys argued that Austin’s “extraordinary intervention
in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own
duly appointed delegate,” meaning the senior Pentagon official
overseeing Guantanamo.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said the government would be irreparably
harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted.</p>
<p>It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial
and the opportunity to “seek capital punishment against three men
charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of
thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.”</p>

<h2 id="fox-news-goes-after-a-solar-farm">Fox News Goes After a Solar
Farm</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Otsego County, Michigan </strong>– The Mitten State is
proving just how hard it can be to build a solar project in wooded
areas. Especially once Fox News gets involved.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Last week, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources said it wanted
to lease more than 400 acres of undeveloped state-owned forestland for
part of a much larger RWE Clean Energy solar project near the northern
Michigan town of Gaylord.
</li>
<li>
Officials said they were approached by the company about the land. But
the news sparked an immediate outcry, as state elected Republicans –
<a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/michigan/article_147bd3a6-cdf0-11ef-b2da-b311a9f5e3a0.html" target="_blank"><u>and
some Democrats</u></a> – demanded to know why a forest would be cleared
for ‘green’ energy. Some called for government firings.
</li>
<li>
Then came the national news coverage. On Friday, Fox News hosted a full
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6366707879112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>four-minute
segment</u></a> focused on this one solar farm featuring iconoclastic
activist Michael Shellenberger.
</li>
<li>
A few days later, RWE told the media it would not develop the project on
state lands.
</li>
<li>
“[D]uring the development process, we conducted outreach to all
landowners adjacent to the project location, including the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources,” the company said in a statement to
<a href="https://www.petoskeynews.com/story/news/local/2025/01/08/energy-company-solar-project-in-otsego-county-wont-use-state-land/77550137007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
</u><u><em><em>Petoskey News-Review</em></em></u></a><em><em>,
</em></em>adding it instead decided to move forward with leasing
property from two private landowners.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Atlantic County, New Jersey</strong> – Opponents of offshore
wind in Atlantic City are trying to undo an ordinance allowing
construction of transmission cables that would connect the Atlantic
Shores offshore wind project to the grid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The ordinance was passed by the city council days before Christmas by a
5-4 vote, paving the way for easements crucial to the cables. Apparently
the room was so packed with critics that the
<a href="https://breakingac.com/news/2024/dec/19/atlantic-city-offshore-wind-plan-passes-after-hours-of-public-comment/" target="_blank"><u>fire
marshall had to step in</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
Now the backlash is coming to roost. Per local talk radio reports,
activists this week
<a href="https://973espn.com/ixp/564/p/atlantic-city-residents-achieve-major-progress-vs-offshore-wind/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a petition</u></a> to the city council opposing the ordinance with more
than 3,000 signatures, a number apparently boosted by an endorsement
from
<a href="https://downbeachbuzz.com/tropicana-casino-finally-joins-fight-against-offshore-wind-disruption/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
least one large casino</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
Atlantic South was fully permitted by the Biden administration in a push
to get as many offshore wind projects out the door as possible before
Trump 2.0. But as we’ve previously explained, killing a cabling route
can be a fatal blow to an offshore wind project – and it’s a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/atlantic-shores-transmission-opposition" target="_self"><u>major
threat to growth</u></a> in New Jersey. So we’ll be watching this
closely.

</ul>

Energy, but the Yakima Nation is coming for Horse Heaven.

<h2 id="how-to-solve-a-problem-like-a-wind-ban">How to Solve a Problem
Like a Wind Ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUyNTU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MjUxMzk1MH0.gGS06U1erWX3JZ-t8RKoGpHU6EGogyTLzDH7OLLC6c0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<strong>1. Trump’s Big Promise </strong>– Our nation’s incoming
president is now saying he’ll ban <em><em>all</em></em> wind projects on
Day 1, an expansion of his previous promise to stop only offshore wind.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“They litter our country like paper, like dropping garbage in a field,”
Trump said at a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbcVF4qrTXU" target="_blank"><u>press
conference Tuesday</u></a>. “We’re going to try and have a policy where
no windmills are built.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
Is this possible? It would be quite tricky, as the president only has
control over the usage of federal lands and waters. While offshore wind
falls entirely under the president’s purview, many onshore wind projects
themselves fall entirely on state lands.
</li>
<li>
This is where the whole “wind kills birds” argument becomes important.
Nearly all wind projects have at least some federal nexus because of
wildlife protection laws, such as the Endangered Species Act and
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
</li>
<li>
Then there are the cables connecting these projects to the grid and
interstate transmission projects that may require approval from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
</li>
<li>
I’m personally doubtful he will actually stop all wind in the U.S.,
though I do think offshore wind in its entirety is at risk (which
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/vineyard-wind-trump" target="_self"><u>I’ve
written about</u></a>). Trump has a habit of conflating things, and in
classic fashion, he only spoke at the press conference about offshore
wind projects. I think he was only referring to offshore wind, though
I’m willing to eat my words.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. The Big Nuclear Lawsuit </strong>– Texas and Utah are suing
to kill the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s authority to
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69506239/1/state-of-texas-v-us-nuclear-regulatory-commission/" target="_blank">license
small modular reactors</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If successful, it would totally neuter permitting powers in this sector,
letting developers and manufacturers avoid a lengthy federal approval
process. SMR startup Last Energy is also
<a href="https://www.lastenergy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">involved
in the lawsuit</a>.
</li>
<li>
The lawsuit cites the Supreme Court’s recent decision to undo a
longstanding principle in American regulatory law that courts should
defer to agency experts when interpreting vague language in statute. As
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer explained when that ruling came down, this
means judges themselves get to decide if a law explicitly gives an
agency
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-epa" target="_self"><u>authority
to do something</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The lawsuit argues the nation’s primary nuclear law, the Atomic Energy
Act, did not give the NRC the discretion to regulate SMRs. “If Congress
wanted the NRC to have plenary authority in this area it needed to speak
clearly. Instead, it has unambiguously indicated the opposite.”
</li>
<li>
I expect more of these lawsuits to come down the pike in the coming
months, as the federal government under Trump will have the power to
settle those cases and offer plaintiffs favorable deregulation through
that process.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Biden’s parting words </strong>– The Biden administration has
finished its long-awaited guidance for the IRA’s tech-neutral
electricity credit (which
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/tech-neutral-energy-tax-credit-final" target="_self">barely
changed</a>) and hydrogen production credit.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo explains in our coverage of the final
hydrogen guidance, the administration made “a number of changes,
exceptions, and other ‘flexibilities’” in order to make “the program
easier to administer and take advantage of.” You can read the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/final-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>full
story here</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile in Congress,<strong> </strong>House Republicans made it easier
to say
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-rules-public-lands" target="_self"><u>selling
public lands is fiscally conservative</u></a>, and bipartisan
<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/16/congress/permitting-reform-dead-00194629" target="_blank"><u>permitting

Anti-Renewables Activists Going Unchallenged?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUyNTY3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDMwNzk4NH0.4ft8vjegDyvAwR5KGwgjeeFQs24sc3Ur_Jbk-9k3ys0/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
This week’s interview is with Brown University professor J. Timmons
Roberts. Those of you familiar with the fight over offshore wind may not
know Roberts by name, but you’re definitely familiar with his work: He
and his students have spearheaded some of the most impactful research
conducted
<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/services-1" target="_blank"><u>on
anti-offshore wind opposition networks</u></a>. This work is a must-read
for anyone who wants to best understand how the anti-renewables movement
functions and why it may be difficult to stop it from winning out.
</p>
<p>
So with Trump 2.0 on the verge of banning offshore wind outright, I
decided to ask Roberts what he thinks developers should be paying
attention to at this moment. The following interview has been lightly
edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is the anti-renewables movement a political force the country
needs to reckon with? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely. In my opinion it’s been unfortunate for the environmental
groups, the wind development, the government officials, climate
scientists – they’ve been unwilling to engage directly with those
groups. They want to keep a very positive message talking about the
great things that come with wind and solar. And they’ve really left the
field open as a result.
</p>
<p>
I think that as these claims sit there unrefuted and naive people – I
don’t mean naive in a negative sense but people who don’t know much
about this issue – are only hearing the negative spin about renewables.
It’s a big problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When you say renewables developers aren’t interacting here – are
you telling me the wind industry is just letting these people run
roughshod?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen no direct refutation in those anti-wind Facebook groups, and
there’s very few environmentalists or others. People are quite afraid to
go in there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>But even just generally. This vast network you’ve tracked – have
you seen a similar kind of counter mobilization on the part of those who
want to build these wind farms offshore? </strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s some mobilization. There’s something called the
<a href="https://www.newenglandforoffshorewind.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
England for Offshore Wind</u></a> coalition. There’s some university
programs. There’s some other oceanographic groups, things like that.
</p>
<p>
My observation is that they’re mostly staff organizations and they’re
very cautious. They’re trying to work as a coalition. And they’re going
as slow as their most cautious member.
</p>
<p>
<strong>As someone who has researched these networks, what are you
watching for in the coming year? Under the first year of Trump 2.0?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah I mean, channeling my optimistic and Midwestern dad, my thought is
that there may be an overstepping by the Trump administration and by
some of these activists. The lack of viable alternative pathways forward
and almost anti-climate approaches these groups are now a part of can
backfire for them. Folks may say, <em><em>why would I want to be
supportive of your group if you’re basically undermining everything I
believe in? </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you think developers should know about the research you
have done into these networks? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think it’s important for deciding bodies and the public, the media and
so on, to know who they’re hearing when they hear voices at a public
hearing or in a congressional field hearing. Who are the people
representing? Whose voice are they advancing?
</p>
<p>
It’s important for these actors that want to advance action on climate
change and renewables to know what strategies and the tactics are being
used and also know about the connections.
</p>
<p>
<strong>One of the things you pointed out in your research is that, yes,
there are dark money groups involved in this movement and there are
outside figures involved, but a lot of this sometimes is just one person
posts something to the internet and then another person posts something
to the internet. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Does that make things harder when it comes to addressing the
anti-renewables movement? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely. Social media’s really been devastating for developing
science and informed, rational public policymaking. It’s so easy to
create a conspiracy and false information and very slanted, partial
information to shoot holes at something as big as getting us off of
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Our position has developed as we understand that indeed these are not
just astro-turf groups created by some far away corporation but there
are legitimate concerns – like fishing, where most of it is based on
certainty – and then there are these sensationalized claims that drive
fears. That fear is real. And it’s unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Anything else you’d really like to tell our readers? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I didn’t really choose this topic. I feel like it really got me. It was
me and four students sitting in my conference room down the hall and I
said, <em><em>have you heard about this group that just started here in
Rhode Island that’s making these claims we should investigate?
</em></em>And students were super excited about it and have really been
the leaders.

<h2 id="an-insurance-startup-faces-a-major-test-in-los-angeles">An
Insurance Startup Faces a Major Test in Los Angeles</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUxNDgzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NzY2NzgyMX0.0OV_bJRXCICLOEyhS8r5S9JyWDUeUoSeOSYZfqdUrUE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>Los
Angeles is on fire</u></a>, and it’s possible that much of the city
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-burning" target="_self"><u>could
burn to the ground</u></a>. This would be a disaster for California’s
already
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-insurance-fair" target="_self"><u>wobbly
home insurance market</u></a> and the residents who rely on it. Kettle
Insurance, a fintech startup focused on wildfire insurance for
Californians, thinks that it can offer a better solution.
</p>
<p>
The company, founded in 2020, has thousands of customers across
California, and L.A. County is its largest market. These huge fires
will, in some sense, “be a good test, not just for the industry, but for
the Kettle model,” Brian Espie, the company’s chief underwriting
officer, told me. What it’s offering is known as “parametric” insurance
and reinsurance (essentially insurance for the insurers themselves.)
While traditional insurance claims can take years to fully resolve — as
some victims of the devastating 2018 Camp Fire know
<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/camp-fire-homeowners-insurance-companies-wildfire/38177380?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>all</u></a>
<a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11746728/i-wish-it-wouldve-burned-navigating-insurance-when-your-home-survives-a-wildfire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too</u></a>
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/12/11/california-wildfires-camp-fire-insurance-company-claims/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>well</u></a>
— Kettle gives policyholders 60 days to submit a notice of loss, after
which the company has 15 days to validate the claim and issue payment.
There is no deductible.
</p>
<p>
As Espie explained, Kettle’s AI-powered risk assessment model is able to
make more accurate and granular calculations, taking into account
forward-looking, climate change-fueled challenges such as
out-of-the-norm weather events, which couldn’t be predicted by looking
at past weather patterns alone (e.g. wildfires in January, when
historically L.A. is wet). Traditionally, California insurers have only
been able to rely upon historical datasets to set their premiums, though
that rule changed last year and never applied to parametric insurers in
the first place.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got about 70 different inputs from global satellite data and real
estate ground level datasets that are combining to predict wildfire
ignition and spread, and then also structural vulnerability,” Espie told
me. “In total, we’re pulling from about 130 terabytes of data and then
simulating millions of fires — so using technology that, frankly,
wouldn’t have been possible 10 or maybe five years ago, because either
the data didn’t exist, or it just wasn’t computationally possible to run
a model like we are today.”
</p>
<p>
As of writing, it’s estimated that
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 2,000 structures</u></a> have burned in Los Angeles. Whenever a
fire encroaches on a parcel of Kettle-insured land, the owner
immediately qualifies for a payout. Unlike most other parametric
insurance plans, which pay a predetermined amount based on metrics such
as the water level during a flood or the temperature during a heat wave
regardless of damages, Kettle <em><em>does</em></em> require
policyholders to submit damage estimates. The company told me that’s
usually pretty simple: If a house burns, it’s almost certain that the
losses will be equivalent to or exceed the policy limit, which can be up
to $10 million. While the company can always audit a property to prevent
insurance fraud, there are no claims adjusters or other third parties
involved, thus expediting the process and eliminating much of the
back-and-forth wrangling residents often go through with their insurance
companies.
</p>
<p>
So how can Kettle afford to do all this while other insurers are exiting
the California market altogether or pulling back in fire-prone regions?
“We like to say that we can put a price on anything with our model,”
Espie told me. “But I will say there are parts of the state that our
model sees as burning every 10 to 15 years, and premiums may be just
practically too expensive for insurance in those areas.” Kettle could
also be an option for homeowners whose existing insurance comes with a
very high wildfire deductible, Espie explained, as buying Kettle’s
no-deductible plan in addition to their regular plan could actually save
them money were a fire to occur.
</p>
<p>
But just because an area has traditionally been considered risky doesn’t
mean that Kettle’s premiums will necessarily be exorbitant. The
company’s CEO, Isaac Espinoza, told me that Kettle’s advanced modeling
allows it to drill down on the risk to specific properties rather than
just general regions. “We view ourselves as ensuring the uninsurable,”
Espinoza said. “Other insurers just blanket say, we don’t want to touch
it. We don’t touch anything in the area. We might say, ’Hey, that’s not
too bad.’”
</p>
<p>
Espie told me that the wildly destructive fires in 2017 and 2018 “gave
people a wake up call that maybe some of the traditional catastrophe
models out there just weren’t keeping up with science and natural
hazards in the face of climate change.” He thinks these latest blazes
could represent a similar turning point for the industry. “This provides
an opportunity for us to prove out that models built with AI and machine
learning like ours can be more predictive of wildfire risk in the
changing climate, where we’re getting 100 mile per hour winds in
January.”

Supreme Court declines to halt Trump’s sentencing in New York hush money
case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Donald Trump’s
request to halt his sentencing in a New York state court for the
president-elect’s conviction on criminal charges stemming from hush
money paid to a porn star.</p>
<p>The court in a 5-4 decision denied Trump’s last-minute bid to prevent
his sentencing, scheduled for Friday at 9:30 a.m. in New York state
court in Manhattan. Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative
Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices -
Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson - in the court’s
majority in denying Trump’s request.</p>
<p>The brief order gave two reasons for the decision.</p>
<p>“First, the alleged evidentiary violations at President-elect Trump’s
state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.
Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the president-elect’s
responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial
court’s stated intent to impose a sentence of ‘unconditional discharge’
after a brief virtual hearing.”</p>
<p>The trial judge in Trump’s case, Justice Juan Merchan, said last week
that he was not inclined to sentence the Republican president-elect to
prison and would likely grant him unconditional discharge. This would
place a guilty judgment on Trump’s record, but would not impose custody,
a fine or probation.</p>
<p>Four conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil
Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - dissented from the decision, noting they
would have granted Trump’s request.</p>
<p>Trump had sought relief from the justices as he pursued a state court
appeal to resolve questions of presidential immunity following a Supreme
Court ruling last July that granted former presidents broad immunity
from criminal prosecution for their official acts.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court acted after New York’s top court on Thursday
rejected Trump’s request to halt his sentencing.</p>
<p>Manhattan prosecutors made a filing at the Supreme Court on Thursday
morning, opposing Trump’s bid for a stay.</p>
<p>‘No basis’ for intervention</p>
<p>“Defendant now asks this court to take the extraordinary step of
intervening in a pending state criminal trial to prevent the scheduled
sentencing from taking place - before final judgment has been entered by
the trial court, and before any direct appellate review of defendant’s
conviction. There is no basis for such intervention,” Manhattan District
Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office wrote in a filing.</p>
<p>Trump in a Supreme Court filing made public on Wednesday asked for
proceedings in the case to stop as he seeks an appeal to resolve
questions of presidential immunity following the Supreme Court’s ruling
last July that granted former presidents broad immunity from criminal
prosecution for their official acts.</p>
<p>“This appeal will ultimately result in the dismissal of the district
attorney’s politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the
very beginning,” Trump lawyer John Sauer wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>Sauer is Trump’s pick to serve as U.S. solicitor general, the
government’s chief lawyer at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Trump was found guilty last May of 34 counts of falsifying business
records to cover up a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in
exchange for her silence before the 2016 U.S. election about a sexual
encounter she has said she had with Trump a decade earlier, which he has
denied. Prosecutors have said the payment was designed to help Trump’s
chances in the 2016 election, when he defeated Democrat Hillary
Clinton.</p>
<p>Trump is the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted
and the first former president convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers contend that prosecutors improperly admitted evidence
of Trump’s official acts during the trial. They also argue that, as
president-elect, Trump is immune from prosecution during the period
between his November election victory and his inauguration.</p>
<p>In their filing on Thursday to the Supreme Court, the New York
prosecutors said that “all of the evidence defendant challenged in his
post-trial motion either concerned unofficial conduct that is not
subject to any immunity, or is a matter of public record that is not
subject to preclusion, as the trial court correctly held.”</p>
<p>As to Trump’s argument that he is immune as president-elect, the
prosecutors said this “extraordinary immunity claim is unsupported by
any decision from any court.”</p>
<p>“It is axiomatic that there is only one president at a time,” they
added.</p>
<p>In the 6-3 July ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the
Supreme Court said immunity for former presidents is “absolute” with
respect to their “core constitutional powers,” and a former president
has “at least a presumptive immunity” for “acts within the outer
perimeter of his official responsibility,” meaning prosecutors face a

<p class="drop-caps">
Everyone knows the story of Mrs. O’Leary’s cow, the one that allegedly
knocked over a lantern in 1871 and burned down 2,100 acres of downtown
Chicago. While the wildfires raging in Los Angeles County have already
far exceeded that legendary bovine’s total attributed damage — at the
time of this writing, on Thursday morning, five fires have
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burned
more than 27,000 acres</u></a> — the losses had centralized, at least
initially, in the secluded neighborhoods and idyllic suburbs in the
hills above the city.
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, that started to change. Evacuation maps have since
extended into
<a href="https://x.com/AaronGuhreen/status/1877119700674469943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
gridded streets of downtown Santa Monica</u></a> and Pasadena, and a new
fire has started north of Beverly Hills,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/sunset-fire-hollywood-hills-evacuations-shelters-closures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>moving
quickly</u></a> toward an internationally recognizable street: Hollywood
Boulevard. The two biggest fires, Palisades and Eaton,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remain
0% contained</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/santa-ana-winds-climate-change" target="_self"><u>high
winds</u></a> have stymied firefighting efforts, all leading to an
exceedingly grim question: Exactly how much of Los Angeles could burn.
Could <em><em>all of it?</em></em>
</p>
<p>
“I hate to be doom and gloom, but if those winds kept up … it’s not
unfathomable to think that the fires would continue to push into L.A. —
into the city,” Riva Duncan, a former wildland firefighter and fire
management specialist who now serves as the executive secretary of
<a href="https://www.grassrootswildlandfirefighters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Grassroots
Wildland Firefighters</u></a>, an advocacy group, told me.
</p>
<p>
When a fire is burning in the chaparral of the hills, it’s one thing.
But once a big fire catches in a neighborhood, it’s a different story.
Houses, with their wood frames, gas lines, and
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/cheap-plastic-filled-furniture-makes-it-easier-for-fir-5923299" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cheap
modern furniture</u></a>, might as well be Duraflame.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>Embers</u></a>
from one burning house then leap to the next and alight in a clogged
gutter or on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire" target="_self"><u>shrubs
planted too close</u></a> to vinyl siding. “That’s what happened with
the Great Chicago Fire. When the winds push fires like that, it’s
pushing the embers from one house to the others,” Duncan said. “It’s a
really horrible situation, but it’s not unfathomable to think about that
[happening in L.A.] — but people need to be thinking about that, and I
know the firefighters are thinking about that.”
</p>
<p>
Once flames engulf a block, it will “overpower” the capabilities of
firefighters, Arnaud Trouvé, the chair of the Department of Fire
Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland, told me in an
email. If firefighters can’t gain a foothold, the fire will continue to
spread “until a change in driving conditions,” such as the winds
weakening to the point that a fire isn’t igniting new fuel or its fuel
source running out entirely, when it reaches something like an expansive
parking lot
<a href="https://x.com/latimes/status/1876851290107412817" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>or
the ocean</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This waiting game sometimes leads to the impression that firefighters
are standing around, not doing anything. But “what I know they’re doing
is they’re looking ahead to places where maybe there’s a park, or some
kind of green space, or a shopping center with big parking lots —
they’re looking for those places where they could make a stand,” Duncan
told me. If an entire city block is <em><em>already</em></em> on fire,
“they’re not going to waste precious water there.”
</p>
<p>
Urban firefighting is a different beast than wildland firefighting, but
Duncan noted that Forest Service, CALFIRE, and L.A. County firefighters
are used to complex mixed environments. “This is their backyard, and
they know how to fight fire there.”
</p>
<p>
“I can guarantee you, many of them haven’t slept 48 hours,” she went on.
“They’re grabbing food where they can; they’re taking 15-minute naps.
They’re in this really horrible smoke — there are toxins that come off
burning vehicles and burning homes, and wildland firefighters don’t wear
breathing apparatus to protect the airways. I know they all have
horrible headaches right now and are puking. I remember those days.”
</p>
<p>
If there’s a sliver of good news, it’s that the biggest fire, Palisades,
can’t burn any further to the west,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/08/weather/los-angeles-fire-maps-california.html#:~:text=Wind%20data%20as%20of%20Jan.%208%20at%2012%20p.m." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
direction the wind is blowing</u></a> — there lies the ocean — meaning
its spread south into Santa Monica toward Venice and Culver City or
Beverly Hills is slower than it would be if the winds shifted. The
westward-moving Santa Ana winds, however, could conceivably fan the
Eaton fire deeper into eastern Los Angeles if conditions don’t let up
soon. “In many open fires, the most important factor is the wind,”
Trouvé explained, “and the fire will continue spreading until the wind
speed becomes moderate-to-low.”
</p>
<p>
Though the wind died down a bit on Wednesday night, conditions are
expected to deteriorate again Thursday evening, and the red flag warning
won’t
<a href="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/weather-news/article298213423.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expire
until Friday</u></a>. And “there are additional winds coming next week,”
Kristen Allison, a fire management specialist with the Southern
California Geographic Area Coordination Center,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>told
me Wednesday</u></a>. “It’s going to be a long duration — and we’re not
seeing any rain anytime soon.”

<h2 id="clock-ticking-on-us-tiktok-ban">Clock ticking on US TikTok
ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A look at some of the most popular short videos on the TikTok social
media platform may prompt head-scratching about what the fuss is.</p>
<p>There is Charli D’Amelio (nearly 156 million followers) from the
state of Connecticut, dancing in an 11-second clip to a remix of a Chris
Brown song.</p>
<p>There is a smiling baby having her cheeks squeezed (400 million
views).</p>
<p>And a video clip has racked up 2.3 billion views of California
illusionist Zach King riding a “magic broomstick.”</p>
<p>Any day now, the billions of comedy skits, dance challenges, life
hacks, and cute pets and babies on TikTok could become invisible in the
United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has fast-tracked oral arguments on a challenge
by the Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to a new U.S. law
that would ban the social media platform on grounds of national
security.</p>
<p>While TikTok, the most popular social media platform in the United
States, has become a part of American culture, its Chinese ownership has
alarmed government officials and lawmakers. Beijing’s potential access
to all that personal data and the ability to shape public opinion for
its American users prompted Congress to ban it, with a 352-65 bipartisan
vote in the House of Representatives last March.</p>
<p>That happened despite TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew’s appeal to American
users to fight the legislation.</p>
<p>“Protect your constitutional rights. Make your voices heard,” Chew, a
Singaporean with a Harvard MBA, said in a TikTok video prior to the
congressional action.</p>
<p>TikTok has repeatedly stated it has ensured the data of its American
users is protected from outside influence and manipulation.</p>
<p>Parent company ByteDance has more than 150,000 employees globally,
including U.S. offices in Austin, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle.</p>
<p>Barring a reprieve by the Supreme Court, ByteDance will lose access
to its largest market on Jan. 19.</p>
<p>“Assuming the Supreme Court upholds the law — unless the Trump
administration can find some workaround, which I’m doubtful they’ll be
able to — the choice is either sell TikTok or face a ban in the United
States,” Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor at the University of
Minnesota School of Law, told VOA.</p>
<p>Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had backed
the ban. But Trump expressed a recent change of heart after his campaign
videos during last year’s election performed well on the platform.</p>
<p>“They brought me a chart, and it was a record. It was so beautiful to
see. And as I looked at it, I said, ‘Maybe we got to keep this sucker
around for a little while,’” Trump said during an appearance in Phoenix
in December.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will listen to the social media company’s appeal on
Friday.</p>
<p>The justices will weigh the national security argument against the
constitutional guarantee of free speech for ByteDance’s American
subsidiary and its estimated 170 million users in the United States.</p>
<p>“That’s one dimension of the conflict. But in another sense, it’s
also a fight within free speech itself, because one thing the government
is arguing is that one of the dangers of having Chinese ownership of
TikTok is that the Chinese government would be able to manipulate the
algorithm and therefore distort the speech environment itself,”
explained Rozenshtein, who is also a senior editor at Lawfare, an online
site that analyzes complicated legal and policy issues related to U.S.
national security.</p>
<p>Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary said he has informed Trump that he’s
nearing a deal to buy the U.S. assets of TikTok that would save it from
being banned.</p>
<p>“I wanted to let him know, as well as others in his Cabinet, that
we’re doing this, and we’re going to need their help,” O’Leary, best
known as one of the hosts of the reality TV program Shark Tank, told Fox
News.</p>
<p>Trump has asked the Supreme Court to put the case on hold so he can
negotiate a sale of the platform following his second inauguration on
Jan. 20 —- the day after the ban is set to go into effect.</p>
<p>In the meantime, another sharing app owned by ByteDance — Lemon8 — is
sponsoring posts on TikTok encouraging users to migrate there.</p>

The transportation, power, and buildings sectors all saw upticks in
emissions last year. But there are some bright spots in the report.
Emissions fell across the industrial sector (down 1.8%) and oil and gas
sector (down 3.7%). Solar and wind power generation surpassed coal for
the first time, and coal production fell by 12% to its lowest level in
decades, resulting in fewer industrial methane emissions. Still, “the
modest 2024 decline underscores the urgency of accelerating
decarbonization in all sectors,” Rhodium’s report concluded. “To meet
its Paris Agreement target of a 50-52% reduction in emissions by 2030,
the U.S. must sustain an ambitious 7.6% annual drop in emissions from
2025 to 2030, a level the U.S. has not seen outside of a recession in
recent memory.”

Jimmy Carter’s economic plea to the American people</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Market Place</p>
<p>On July 15, 1979, amid inflation and long lines at the gas pump,
Carter made a speech that in many ways exemplified his presidency.</p>

Carter’s woodworking, painting and poetry reveal introspective
Renaissance Man</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PLAINS, Ga. — The world knew Jimmy Carter as a president and
humanitarian, but he also was a woodworker, painter and poet, creating a
body of artistic work that reflects deeply personal views of the global
community — and himself. </p>
<p>His portfolio illuminates his closest relationships, his spartan
sensibilities and his place in the evolution of American race relations.
And it continues to improve the finances of The Carter Center, his
enduring legacy. </p>
<p>Creating art provided “the rare opportunity for privacy” in his
otherwise public life, Carter said. “These times of solitude are like
being in another very pleasant world.” </p>
<p>‘One of the best gifts of my life’ </p>
<p>Mourners at Carter’s hometown funeral will see the altar cross he
carved in maple and collection plates he turned on his lathe.
Great-grandchildren in the front pews at Maranatha Baptist Church slept
as infants in cradles he fashioned. </p>
<p>The former president measured himself a “fairly proficient”
craftsman. Chris Bagby, an Atlanta woodworker whose shop Carter
frequented, elevated that assessment to “rather accomplished.” </p>
<p>Carter gleaned the basics on his father’s farm, where the Great
Depression meant being a jack-of-all-trades. He learned more in shop
class and with Future Farmers of America. “I made a miniature of the
White House,” he recalled, insisting it was not about his
ambitions. </p>
<p>During his Navy years, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter chose unfurnished
military housing to stretch his $300 monthly wage, and he built their
furniture himself in a shop on base. </p>
<p>As president, Carter nurtured woodworking rather than his golf game,
spending hours in a wood shop at Camp David to make small presents for
family and friends. And when he left the White House, West Wing aides
and Cabinet members pooled money for a shopping spree at Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co. so he could finally assemble a full-scale home woodshop. </p>
<p>“One of the best gifts of my life,” Carter said. </p>
<p>Working in their converted garage, he previewed decades of Habitat
for Humanity work by refurbishing their one-story house in Plains. He
also improved his fine woodworking skills, joining wood without nails or
screws. He also bought Japanese carving tools, and fashioned a chess set
later owned by a Saudi prince. </p>
<p>Not just any customer </p>
<p>Carter frequented Atlanta’s Highland Woodworking, a shop replete with
a library of how-to books and hard-to-find tools, and recruited the
world’s preeminent handmade furniture maker, Tage Frid, as an
instructor, Bagby said. </p>
<p>Still hanging near the store entrance is a picture of Frid, who died
in 2004, teaching students including a smiling former president at the
front of the class. </p>
<p>“He was like a regular customer,” Bagby said, other than the “Secret
Service agents who came with him.” </p>
<p>Carter built four ladder-back chairs out of hickory in 1983, and
Sotheby’s auctioned them for $21,000 each at the time, the first of many
sales of Carter paintings and furniture that raised millions to benefit
The Carter Center. </p>
<p>It was rarely about the money, though. Jill Stuckey, a longtime
friend who would have the Carters over to her home in Plains, recalled
seeing the former president carrying out one of her chairs. </p>
<p>“I said, ‘What are you doing?’” she recalled. “He said, ‘It’s broken.
I’m going to take it home and fix it.’” </p>
<p>He was at her back door at 7:30 the next morning, holding her
repaired chair. </p>
<p>Carter compared woodworking to the results of his labor as a Navy
engineer, or as a boy on the farm: “I like to see what I have done, what
I have made.” </p>
<p>‘No special talent,’ but his paintings drive auctions </p>
<p>Carter employed a folk-art style as a late-in-life amateur painter
and claimed “no special talent,” but a 2020 Carter Center auction drew
$340,000 for his painting titled “Cardinals,” and his oil-on-canvas of
an eagle sold for $225,000 in 2023, months after he entered hospice
care. </p>
<p>Carter’s work hangs throughout the center’s campus. A room where he
met with dignitaries is encircled with birds he painted after he and
Rosalynn took on bird watching as a hobby. </p>
<p>Near the executive offices are a self-portrait and a painting of
Rosalynn in their early post-presidential years, hanging across from a
trio of Andy Warhol prints showing Carter in office. </p>
<p>Carter’s earliest years predominate, with boyhood farm scenes and
portraits of influential figures like his father James Earl Carter Sr.,
whose death in 1953 led him to abandon a Navy career and eventually
enter politics in Georgia. </p>
<p>Some of his subjects, including both of his parents, are looking
away. Carter’s likeness of his mother shows “Miss Lillian” as a
70-year-old Peace Corps volunteer in India. Jason Carter said the piece
was particularly meaningful to his grandfather, who lost reelection at a
relatively youthful 56. </p>
<p>“When he got out of the White House, she was standing there saying,
’Well, I turned 70 in the Peace Corps. What are you going to do?” Jason
Carter said. </p>
<p>One Carter subject who meets his gaze is a young Rosalynn — they
married when she was 18 and he was 21. He described her as “remarkably
beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet
unrestrained in our discussions.” </p>
<p>Another who doesn’t look away is Rachel Clark, a Black sharecropper
who had hosted the future president after they worked in the fields.
“Except for my parents, Rachel Clark was the person closest to me,”
Carter wrote of his childhood. </p>
<p>‘Just a word of praise’ </p>
<p>Carter wrote more than 30 books — even a novel — but was most
introspective in poetry. </p>
<p>On his first real recognition of Jim Crow segregation: “A silent line
was drawn between friend and friend, race and race.” </p>
<p>On his Cold War submarine’s delicate dance with enemies: “We wanted
them to understand … to share our love of solitude … the peace we
yearned to keep.” </p>
<p>Rosalynn’s smile, he gushed, silenced the birds, “or may be I failed
to hear their song.” </p>
<p>Perhaps Carter’s most revealing poem, “I Wanted to Share My Father’s
World,” concerns the man who never got to see his namesake son’s
achievements. He wrote that he despised Earl’s discipline, and swallowed
hunger for “just a word of praise.” </p>
<p>Only when he brought his own sons to visit his dying father did he
“put aside the past resentments of the boy” and see “the father who will
never cease to be alive in me.”</p>

id="schools-cancel-classes-across-southern-us-as-another-burst-of-winter-storms-move-in">Schools
cancel classes across Southern US as another burst of winter storms move
in</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dallas, Texas — Schools and buildings from Texas to Georgia were shut
down Thursday or prepared to close ahead of freezing rain and snow
forecast for much of the Southern U.S. as another burst of plunging
temperatures and winter storms threatened to again snarl travel. </p>
<p>Texas schools canceled classes for more than 1 million students in
anticipation of icy and potentially dangerous conditions that could last
into Friday. Closures also kept students home in Kansas City and
Arkansas’ capital, Little Rock, while Virginia’s capital, Richmond,
remained under a weather-related boil advisory. </p>
<p>The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through
the Los Angeles area, forcing residents to flee from burning homes
through flames, ferocious winds and towering clouds of smoke. </p>
<p>Texas braces for snow </p>
<p>In the Dallas area, crews treated roads ahead of the expected
Thursday arrival of about 5 to 10 centimeters of snow. Up to 12.7
centimeters was expected farther north near Oklahoma, according to the
National Weather Service. </p>
<p>Gov. Greg Abbott said the state deployed emergency crews in advance
and urged residents to avoid driving in bad weather if possible. </p>
<p>Boston native Gina Eaton, who stocked up on groceries in Dallas ahead
of the storm, said she has some trepidation sharing roads with drivers
unaccustomed to ice and snow. </p>
<p>“Even if there is ice, I’m very comfortable driving in it,” Eaton
said. “It’s just other people that scare me.” </p>
<p>Roads could be slick Friday as 75,000 fans were expected head to
AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington for the college football championship
semifinal between Texas and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. Arlington
spokesperson Susan Shrock said crews will be ready to address any
hazardous road conditions. </p>
<p>Southern discomfort </p>
<p>A mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain was expected along a stretch
from New Mexico to Alabama. Forecasters said the heaviest amounts were
likely in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and
Texas. </p>
<p>The system was expected to push northeastward by Friday with heavy
snow and freezing rain all the way to the Virginia and North Carolina
coasts. As much as about 20 centimeters of snow could fall in parts of
Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through Saturday,
the weather service said. </p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced the closure of some state offices
on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said city offices would be
closed, with employees working remotely. </p>
<p>Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan said
he expected schools across the state to close Friday, although decisions
will be made at the local level. </p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Some experts say such events are happening more frequently,
paradoxically, because of a warming world. </p>
<p>The agricultural impact </p>
<p>Some parts of Kansas have received nearly an entire year’s average of
snow over the past few days, hitting farmers and ranchers “in ways that
we haven’t seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a
lifetime,” said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State
University. </p>
<p>Calves are especially at risk and can die when temperatures slip
below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from
reaching herds with food and water </p>
<p>In northern Florida, growers were most concerned about ferns that are
cultivated for floral arrangements, with Valentine’s Day only a month
away.</p>

id="former-president-jimmy-carter-to-be-honored-at-washington-funeral">Former
President Jimmy Carter to be honored at Washington funeral</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is set to be honored
Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral before being
buried in his home state of Georgia.</p>
<p>Carter’s living presidential successors – Bill Clinton, George W.
Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – are due to attend the
Washington funeral, with Biden delivering a eulogy.</p>
<p>Mourners from the public were able to pay their final respects
overnight at the U.S. Capitol, where Carter’s casket lay in state since
Tuesday.</p>
<p>David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict
Resolution at George Mason University, said the former president
obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol
to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes.</p>
<p>“He had such an impact on so many people,” he said. “His work on
advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting
our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very
important things to me.”</p>
<p>In the Capitol rotunda – where only about 50 Americans have been
recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader
Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: “Navy
veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United
States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace
and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his
creator and his fellow man.”</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris – who on Monday in the Capitol certified
the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy.</p>
<p>“He was the first president of the United States to have a
comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first
federal support for clean energy,” she said Tuesday. “He also passed
over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental
protection. And more than doubled the size of America’s national
parks.”</p>
<p>Carter, who served as the 39th president, died Dec. 29 at the age of
100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia.
Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny
roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta,
the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his
state funeral.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant
to them.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was
“a real moral person.”</p>
<p>“He taught Sunday school – I did, too!” she said, smiling. “But I
think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s
president.”</p>
<p>South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that
while he did not align with Carter politically, “President Carter was a
good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved
America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t
(dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his
country.”</p>
<p>In late December, after receiving news of Carter’s death, Biden said,
“We may never see his like again. You know we can all do well to try to
be a little more like Jimmy Carter.”</p>
<p>Analysts say the two men have a few things in common.</p>
<p>“There’s an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be
a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,”
Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on
Zoom. “And that’s never a reflection of the right combination of
politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents
put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for
that.”</p>
<p>When asked what Carter and Trump have in common, Galston paused.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know how to begin to answer that question,” he said
finally. “The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think
of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as
outsiders.”</p>

more ordered to evacuate as Los Angeles wildfires spread</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>More than 130,000 people in the Los Angeles area were under
evacuation orders early Thursday as firefighters battled multiple major
wildfires that already killed at least five people and destroyed more
than 1,000 structures.</p>
<p>A new, fast-moving fire broke out late Wednesday in the Hollywood
Hills, prompting the latest round of orders for people to flee to
safety.</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the dry conditions and strong winds conducive to
the breakout and spread of the fires are expected to remain in place
through Friday.</p>
<p>High wind gusts had forced the grounding of planes used to help fight
the fires, but officials said Wednesday the winds had eased enough for
those operations to resume.</p>
<p>“Tonight, we have very mild wind conditions where we can get aircraft
and a ton of additional resources getting their hands around this fire,”
Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. “That’s what gives me
confidence that we’re going to get a handle on this fire.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a federal emergency declaration
for California to release federal money and resources to help battle the
wildfires.</p>
<p>The White House said late Wednesday that Biden canceled a planned
trip to Italy so that he can “remain focused on directing the full
federal response in the days ahead.”</p>
<p>“We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes,
to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to
normal. It’s going to be a hell of a long way,” Biden said Wednesday.
“It’s going to take time.”</p>
<p>The Defense Department pledged to provide “additional firefighting
personnel and capabilities” to California.</p>
<p>While authorities had warned of the potential for wildfires in the
Los Angeles area given the conditions this week, the blazes were more
extensive than anticipated.</p>
<p>“The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major
brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and
low humidities,” L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said
Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hollywood area, there were active fires in Pacific
Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Sylmar.</p>
<p>Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to
spread.</p>
<p>“We have no percentage of containment,” Marrone said.</p>
<p>Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local
firefighters.</p>
<p>In Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next,
pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said
hydrants had run dry.</p>
<p>“We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades,” said
Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power. “We pushed the system to the
extreme.”</p>
<p>The call for water was “four times the normal demand … for 15 hours
straight,” she added.</p>
<p>The fire in Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the history
of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the
Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which
demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of L.A.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
As wildfires spread through the Los Angeles area, one resident of a tony
neighborhood made a desperate plea for help on social media. “Does
anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home in
Pacific Palisades?”
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paleofuture.bsky.social/post/3lf7jb526oc2n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
Keith Wasserman on X. “Will pay any amount.” The reaction was
predictable: Some users expressed their wish that Wasserman’s house
would burn down, while others
<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/keith-wasserman-investor-los-angeles-wildfires/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
earlier tweets in which he had cheered Donald Trump’s pledges to lower
taxes, and even once said “Real estate ballers don’t pay any taxes!”
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to feel too much sympathy for a rich guy getting what looks
like a pointed object lesson in the necessity of universal services: If
you’re disappointed that the government wasn’t able to save your house
in a disaster, perhaps you should reconsider your advocacy for lowering
the taxes that fund things like the fire department. But once we get the
mockery out of our systems, perhaps we should approach Mr. Wasserman and
his like-minded peers with a more open heart, and see this particular
disaster as an opportunity to convince more people like him that we’re
all in the path of the same threats.
</p>
<p>
Because like it or not, addressing climate change requires the help of
the wealthy — not just a small number of megadonors to environmental
organizations, but the rich as a class. The more they understand that
their money will not insulate them from the effects of a warming planet,
the more likely they are to be allies in the climate fight, and vital
ones at that.
</p>
<p>
As of this writing the fires in Los Angeles are still burning, but it
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html?t=1736358986008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
appears</u></a> that they could be among the costliest in history, not
because of their size but because they are reducing some of the priciest
real estate in America to ashes. It’s another vivid lesson in a truth
more people need to learn: Climate change will affect everyone, no
matter how much money you have.
</p>
<p>
Yes, those most affected will be people without resources, who live in
vulnerable areas they can’t easily flee, and who are unable to harden
their homes and communities against the most destructive effects of
warming. Those with the lowest incomes
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>feel
the brunt</u></a> of climate change in multiple ways.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a difference between being less vulnerable and being
invulnerable. There are only so many times you can rebuild your beach
house, only so many private firefighters you can hire, and only so often
you can turn up the air conditioning. We saw in Asheville how a place
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137024/climate-haven-hurricane-helene-asheville" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believed</u></a>
to be a “climate haven” turned out to be just as susceptible to natural
disaster as anywhere else. In the end, climate change comes for us all.
And experiencing a climate-related event
<a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/2024-poll-americans-views-on-climate-change-and-policy-in-12-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
a significant impact</u></a> on whether people both accept the reality
of climate change and prioritize it as a political issue.
</p>
<p>
The more wealthy people believe that climate change is a threat to them
and support policies that mitigate emissions, the better the chances
that those policies will be translated into law. A
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>number</u></a>
of
<a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>studies</u></a>
by political scientists in recent years have shown that the policy
preferences of the wealthy are more likely to prevail; it’s one of those
findings that no one is surprised by, but it’s useful to have it
demonstrated empirically. The wealthy are more politically active,
donate more money, and are generally treated by politicians as though
they cannot be ignored.
</p>
<p>
So while mass mobilization is a key component of successful movements,
it doesn’t hurt to have rich people on your side, too. Surveys already
show that higher-income voters are somewhat
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/understanding-pro-climate-voters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
likely</u></a> to support policies to address climate change, though the
differences are not that large. And if increasing numbers of them decide
that the government has to institute more climate-friendly policies,
wealthier voters might even put pressure on the party that usually
represents their interests as a class: the GOP.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, getting the wealthy to unite with the rest of us in common
purpose will not be easy. One of the primary functions of wealth is to
insulate the privileged from negative externalities of existence, both
large and small. It separates them from ordinary people and the ordinary
headaches of life. The wealthy glide through the world as though on a
moving walkway, exempted from having to wait in lines or get their hands
dirty or spend time worrying about their vulnerability. And they often
use their political influence to insulate themselves even further,
advocating for policies that starve the government of funds and
exacerbate inequality.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, disasters like the fires we’re seeing right now wind up being
interpreted through existing political lenses; Donald Trump is blaming
them on the governor of California, to whom he
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lfausi5rsc2v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refers</u></a>,
classy and mature as ever, as “Gavin Newscum,” while other conservatives
are
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/natural-disasters/maga-actor-breaks-down-in-tears-as-he-reveals-home-destroyed-in-cali-fires/ar-AA1xbRCl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>angrily
denying</u></a> that warming temperatures had anything to do with the
destruction in southern California.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there’s room for a generous response, to say even to the
wealthiest of victims that we’re sorry they suffered the consequences of
warming and hope they’ll become allies in the fight against climate
change, because we’re all in it together. We all need robust public
infrastructure (including an effective fire department), along with
policies that will make wildfires and other disasters less destructive.
The more people who come into the tent — even if it was only once they
had to flee a disaster they only thought would affect the little people
— the better off we’ll be.

informant who made up claims about Bidens sentenced to 6 years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A former FBI informant who admitted lying about U.S.
President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden’s interactions with a Ukrainian
energy company was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday, court
records showed. </p>
<p>Alexander Smirnov pleaded guilty last month of causing the creation
of a false record after falsely telling his FBI handler that he had
knowledge of bribes paid by executives at Burisma Holdings to Joe and
Hunter Biden, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a role that has
attracted years of scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. </p>
<p>Smirnov also admitted tax evasion. </p>
<p>Prosecutors working with special counsel David Weiss, who
investigated matters related to Hunter Biden, had asked U.S. District
Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles to sentence Smirnov to six years in
federal prison. </p>
<p>“The defendant decided in 2020 to exploit the position of trust he
enjoyed with the FBI in order to provide false information about one of
the candidates for president of the United States in an attempt to
influence the outcome of the election,” prosecutors wrote in a court
filing, referring to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Smirnov sought a four-year prison sentence, arguing
Smirnov had accepted responsibility and suffered a “personal downfall”
resulting from the case. </p>
<p>Smirnov falsely claimed in conversations with the FBI that executives
at Burisma told him in 2015 or 2016, while Joe Biden was vice president,
that they’d hired Hunter Biden to “protect us, through his dad, from all
kinds of problems.”  </p>
<p>Smirnov also fabricated a claim that Joe and Hunter Biden were each
paid $5 million in bribes from Burisma executives, according to court
documents. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers learned of an FBI record documenting Smirnov’s
claims, which briefly became a focus of a since-abandoned effort to
impeach Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Weiss, the special counsel, also brought two criminal cases against
Hunter Biden on tax and gun charges. Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon
for his son last month, ending both prosecutions.</p>

<h2 id="us-to-pledge-500m-for-ukraine-at-ramstein-meeting">US to pledge
$500M for Ukraine at Ramstein meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — The United States is providing Ukraine
with $500 million in additional weapons and equipment from its existing
military stockpiles, in what officials told VOA will be the final
military aid package before President Joe Biden leaves office.</p>
<p>The officials were speaking to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of
the announcement, which is expected Thursday when U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin hosts the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in
Ramstein, Germany, for the last time.</p>
<p>“Our focus will be on maintaining momentum, delivering results, and
sending a clear message: The international community stands resolute in
its support for Ukraine,” Austin said.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that he will join
Austin at the 25th meeting of the group, which comprises about 50
nations that came together under Austin’s leadership to coordinate
security assistance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February
2022.</p>
<p>“They [Ukrainians] continue to survive, but they do that with the
support of the U.S. and other allied countries and coalitions through
the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. And I think it’s pretty clear that
the Ukraine Defense Contact Group is, it’s more than just a common
understanding. It’s a common cause,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary
Sabrina Singh said Wednesday.</p>
<p>As Ukrainians fight to survive, that common cause to support their
fight is shrouded in uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump has not
indicated whether he will continue America’s leadership of the group
when President Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, and current
administration officials and defense analysts warn that could prove
catastrophic for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and
Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that
Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration’s handling
of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis “on
his record.”</p>
<p>“If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine,
then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Rather than cut Kyiv’s lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge
support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration “to put
Ukraine in the strongest possible position” ahead of any peace
negotiations.</p>
<p>There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was
passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can’t send that
aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to
restock its own supplies.</p>
<p>While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high
point of Austin’s legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations
within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have
hampered Ukraine’s fight.</p>
<p>Bowman says that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the
Biden administration told them “no,” then “maybe,” before finally
saying, “yes.”</p>
<p>“During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying
and the delay being costly,” he said.</p>
<p>Since Russia’s invasion in 2022, the group of about 50 nations has
provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and
equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than
half of the group’s aid.</p>
<p>Officials said the administration hoped the latest aid package, along
with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put
Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that
at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from
U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden left office. One
notable exception, a senior defense official said, was a group of
military vehicles that were still being refurbished to be used on the
battlefield.</p>

port strike averted as 45,000 union workers, employers reach deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The union representing 45,000 dock workers on the U.S. East and Gulf
Coasts and their employers on Wednesday said they reached a tentative
deal on a new six-year contract, averting further strikes that could
have snarled supply chains and taken a toll on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The International Longshoremen’s Association and the United States
Maritime Alliance employer group, in a joint statement, called the
agreement a win-win. The deal includes a resolution in automation, which
had been the thorniest issue on the table.</p>
<p>“This agreement protects current ILA jobs and establishes a framework
for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while
modernizing East and Gulf coast ports – making them safer and more
efficient and creating the capacity they need to keep our supply chains
strong,” the groups said.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The talks had been extended until Jan. 15 to reach a deal on
automation. Shipping industry executives, customers and analysts had
been concerned that the parties would be unable to overcome their
impasse, leading to a second ILA strike just days before President-elect
Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.</p>
<p>A three-day ILA strike in October had triggered a surge in shipping
prices and cargo backlogs at the 36 affected ports. Longshoremen
returned to work after employers agreed to a 62% wage increase over the
next six years.</p>
<p>Employers at the ports stretching from Maine to Texas include
terminal operators like APM, owned by Danish container carrier Maersk,
as well as the U.S. arms of other major carriers like China’s COSCO
Shipping and Switzerland’s MSC.</p>
<p>ILA and USMX have agreed to continue operating under the current
contract until the union can meet with its full Wage Scale Committee and
schedule a ratification vote, and USMX members can ratify the terms of
the final contract.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-l.a.-fires-are-doing-to-the-citys-air">What the L.A.
Fires Are Doing to the City’s Air</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUwNjEyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTA1ODUyMX0.q0-Z6HACO_yD9gA9ia2aGAw7ANtCNe-KxSgOz1Ifzu8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Wildfires have been raging across Los Angeles County since Tuesday
morning, but only in the past 24 hours or so has the city’s air quality
begun to suffer.
</p>
<p>
That’s because of the classic path of the Santa Ana winds, Alistair
Hayden, a public health professor at Cornell who studies how wildfire
smoke affects human health, told me. “Yesterday, it looked like the
plumes [from the Palisades fire] were all blowing out to sea, which I
think makes sense with the Santa Ana wind patterns blowing to the
southwest,” Hayden said.
</p>
<p>
But with the Eaton fire now raging near Pasadena, northeast of Los
Angeles, the air quality across large swaths of the city is
deteriorating, Hayden said. That’s because the winds are now carrying a
smoke plume as they travel down to the coast. And the situation is still
changing rapidly.
</p>
<p>
At 6:30 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, the historic core of L.A.
registered an air quality index of 105, according to
<a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
AirNow fire and smoke map</u></a>, part of the federal government’s
national air quality index. Anything over 100 is considered unhealthy
for sensitive groups such as asthmatics. In Pasadena and East Los
Angeles, the AQI was in the high 180s, 190s, and even the low 200s,
which ranks as “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” for everyone.
</p>
<p>
The AirNow map is a joint effort of the Interagency Wildland Fire Air
Quality Response Program and the Environmental Protection Agency,
incorporating smoke plume data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s satellites, Hayden said.
</p>
<p>
It also shows readings from the EPA’s permanent air quality monitors set
up across Los Angeles. And it includes data from cheaper, commercial
sensors — from manufacturers such as
<a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooex-1UiEhfSNt76wdBklaOw9whEVb4IC4ZjsoaNAIHzYmK4rIr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PurpleAir</u></a>
— that people can set up in their homes and backyards. The AirNow site
also calibrates the data from those commercial sensors so that they can
be more accurately compared to the government’s more robust and
scientific air quality sensors. (Many websites that display the
PurpleAir data do not calibrate the data in this way, he said, which can
lead to faulty readings.)
</p>
<p>
In recent years, wildfire smoke
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/los-angeles-wildfire-smoke-study" target="_self"><u>has
become a major driver</u></a> of America’s air pollution.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been so successful that cleaning up our air through the Clean Air
Act and other state-level activities that the air has been getting
better for decades,” Hayden told me. “Now, with the growth of these huge
wildfires emitting large amounts of pollution, that has undone some of
the progress of all this awesome work over this past decade.
</p>
<p>
“It’s amazing what we can do when we choose to do so,” he said. “But it
shows there’s more work needed to be done of how do we protect
communities from this current and growing threat of not just wildfires,
but the smoke from those wildfires as well.”

The massive wildfires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena in Southern
California may deal a devastating blow to the state’s fragile home
insurance market, which is in the midst of large-scale reforms as part
of an effort to lure private insurers back to the state.
</p>
<p>
In the years running up to yesterday’s, today’s, and
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/perilous-winds-will-continue-through-wednesday-fueling-destructive-l-a-fires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely
tomorrow’s</u></a> fires, several home insurers
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/business/allstate-insurance-california.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
plans to stop writing new policies</u></a> in California, or
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-04-19/california-exodus-of-home-insurance-companies-continues" target="_blank"><u>even
leave the state entirely</u></a>. The industry and many analysts blamed
not just California’s famously hostile mix of dry vegetation, high
winds, and scarce
rains,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/why-insurance-rates-have-been-surging-in-california-and-florida" target="_blank">
</a>but also a rise in construction and reinsurance costs and a
regulatory system that
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/why-insurance-rates-have-been-surging-in-california-and-florida" target="_blank"><u>made
it difficult</u></a> for insurers to raise rates or think prospectively
about risk when setting rates.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it was simply easier for insurers
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-insurance-nonrenewal-map-19589630.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
not renew policies</u></a> than it was for them to increase rates to
better adjust for risk. Some of these
<a href="https://x.com/PplsCityCouncil/status/1876904641830465923" target="_blank"><u>non-renewals
occurred in the area now affected by the Eaton Fire</u></a> in Altadena,
though they were
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/home-insurance-nonrenewal-map-19589630.php" target="_blank"><u>most
prevalent</u></a> in the Bay Area and the Sierra Nevada foothills.
</p>
<p>
In response, California’s insurance commissioner Ricardo Lara rolled out
a set of reforms last year
that<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release057-2024.cfm" target="_blank">
</a>tried to both
<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release057-2024.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expand
insurance in wildfire prone areas and lure insurers back to the
state</u></a>. The new rules would allow insurers to use models to
determine risk (not just historical data, as the law had previously been
interpreted to allow) while also mandating that insurance companies
operating in the state write policies in fire-prone areas as well as in
those that are relatively safe. Lara
then<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/30/806461.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>issued another rule late last year allowing insurers to
<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/30/806461.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>use
the cost of reinsurance</u></a> in determining their rates, which
insurers in the rest of the country
<a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2024/12/30/california-will-soon-require-insurers-to-increase-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
allowed to do</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Allstate, which announced in November, 2022 that it would stop writing
new home insurance policies in California, said last spring that it was
considering a return to the state based on the possibility of
<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/allstate-says-it-is-considering-return-to-california-homeowners-insurance-market-486896.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>models
being allowed for ratemaking</u></a>. At the end of last year, partly in
response to the reforms, Farmers also said that it would restart writing
new policies for some lines of business in California, and that it would
increase the number of new homeowners
<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2024/12/11/804458.htm" target="_blank"><u>insurance
policies it writes every month</u></a> after
<a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2023/07/07/729194.htm" target="_blank"><u>instituting
limits in 2023</u></a>. Last week,
<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/catastrophe/verisk-submits-wildfire-model-under-new-ca-regulations-519343.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Verisk
submitted a model</u></a> to project wildfire risk to the state for
regulatory agency review for use in rate-setting.
</p>
<p>
Consumer advocates have warned that these rules would lead to increases
in insurance rates. So has Lara’s predecessor, Dave Jones, who has been
skeptical of trying to grow the private insurance market by giving it
more flexibility to set rates without addressing the core issues of
climate change and fire management policy.
</p>
<p>
“In the long term, we’re not going to be able to ‘rate increase’
ourselves out of this problem,” he said in an
<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/heres-why-you-cant-get-home-insurance-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview
with the University of California</u></a>, pointing to Florida’s
insurance problems as an example, despite the flexibility that insurers
have in setting rates there. “In the short-and mid-term for California,
giving insurers proposed higher rates will get them to start writing new
insurance again — although many homes in the wildland urban interface
will continue to face challenges. But in the longer term, higher rates
alone are likely to be overwhelmed by the higher risks and losses from
climate change<em><em> — </em></em>just like in Florida.”
</p>
<p>
Like Florida, California has a backup for the private market, an insurer
of last resort. And, like Florida, it’s been trying to make it smaller,
to little avail. It may now be so large as to place the rest of the
state at financial risk.
</p>
<p>
California’s FAIR Plan is a fire insurance pool that all property and
casualty insurers operating in the state contribute to in proportion to
how much business they have in the state; homeowners turn to FAIR when
they can’t get insurance otherwise. As the state has experienced massive
wildfires and insurers have pulled out, the size of the FAIR Plan has
ballooned, with exposure rising to $458 billion in 2024 from $153
billion in 2020,
<a href="https://www.cfpnet.com/about-fair-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even
as it explicitly says</u></a> that its “goal is attrition” (i.e. getting
customers back on normal insurance plans).
</p>
<p>
“It’s a socialized cost,” Kate Gordon, the chief executive of California
Forward, a policy nonprofit, and former advisor to Secretary of Energy
Jennifer Granholm, told me. “We see more and more people switching to
the FAIR plan. It’s getting massively oversubscribed. It’s going to hit
some kind of wall at some point.”
</p>
<p>
The communities with the most wildfire exposure for the insurer include
vacation areas throughout the state such as Lake Arrowhead, Truckee, and
Big Bear Lake, and affluent residential communities including Berkeley
and the San Francisco suburb Orinda. They also include Pacific
Palisades, the fifth most wildfire-exposed market for FAIR in Southern
California, with some $5.9 billion of exposure.
</p>
<p>
While the fires have yet to be substantially contained, let alone
extinguished, and the damage has not yet been calculated, the
still-raging fires will likely constitute a major hit to the FAIR Plan
and California insurers. The number of residential FAIR policies in the
Pacific Palisades zip code
<a href="https://www.cfpnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CFP5yearPIFGrowthbyzipcodethrough09302024(Residential%20line)20241112v001.pdf" target="_blank"><u>grew
by over 80% between 2023 and 2024</u></a>, and has quadrupled since
2020. The total financial exposure for residential insurance in Pacific
Palisades doubled in the past year, growing to almost $3 billion. In one
zipcode affected by the fire in Altadena, residential FAIR plan policies
grew by over 40% since 2020, with around $950 million of total exposure.
</p>
<p>
“As the risk of more climate change-intensified wildfires increases in
California, a major wildfire in one geographical area concentrated with
FAIR Plan-insured properties could overwhelm the FAIR Plan’s reserves
and its capacity to quickly and fully pay consumers’ claims,”
<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/BULLETIN_2024-8__RE_INSURER_RECOUPMENT_PROCEDURES_IN_THE_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_EVENT_OF_ASSESSMENT_BY_THE_FAIR_PLAN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lara
wrote in a bulletin in September</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Like other states with insurers of last resort, the FAIR Plan can seek
cash from insurers — which could,
<a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/BULLETIN_2024-8__RE_INSURER_RECOUPMENT_PROCEDURES_IN_THE_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_EVENT_OF_ASSESSMENT_BY_THE_FAIR_PLAN.pdf" target="_blank"><u>if
the losses are large enough</u></a>, extract “temporary supplemental
fees from their own policyholders,” according to new California
insurance regulations. This would mean that Californians who
<em><em>were</em></em> able to buy private insurance — because they
don’t live in a region of the state that insurers have abandoned — could
be on the hook for massive wildfire losses. While such an assessment has
not occurred since 1994, Victoria Roach, the FAIR Plan’s president,
warned in a hearing before the State Assembly last March that a major
fire
<a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/a-new-shade-of-green/2024/03/31/wildfires-are-putting-your-insurance-at-risk-heres-why/" target="_blank"><u>could
knock out the plan’s reserves</u></a> and force it to go to insurers —
and their policyholders — to shell out for the difference.

signs emergency declaration for California wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a federal emergency
declaration for California that will release money and resources to
battle the wildfires.</p>
<p>“We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes,
to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to
normal. It’s gonna be a hell of a long way,” Biden said. “It’s gonna
take time.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Defense Department said Wednesday that “it will work to
provide additional firefighting personnel and capabilities” to
California for its battle against the out-of-control fires.</p>
<p>The total amount of damage from the wildfires could run between $52
billion and $57 billion or more in losses, according to an analysis by
AccuWeather’s Global Weather Center.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Fire Department faced four life-threatening
wildfires that have killed at least five people, burned more than 1,100
buildings, and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.</p>
<p>“The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major
brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and
low humidities,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said
Wednesday. The fires erupted in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena
and Sylmar.</p>
<p>Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to
spread.</p>
<p>“We have no percentage of containment,” Marrone said.</p>
<p>Officials have warned residents to pay attention to evacuation orders
and leave when directed.</p>
<p>Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local
firefighters.</p>
<p>Fire hydrants run dry</p>
<p>In the Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next,
pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said
hydrants had run dry.</p>
<p>“We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades,” Janisse
Quiñones said Wednesday. Quiñones is the chief executive and chief
engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We pushed
the system to the extreme.”</p>
<p>The call for water was “four times the normal demand … for 15 hours
straight,” she added.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, support aircraft that had been grounded by the
strong winds were airborne again, dropping water and fire retardant on
the fire.</p>
<p>The fire in the Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the
history of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the
Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which
demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>At least 70,000 evacuation orders are in effect for the fires. Most
of them were issued for Pacific Palisades.</p>
<p>Three evacuation centers for people and 12 for animals have opened
for those fleeing the fires, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The Pasadena Convention Center had several hundred evacuees by
Wednesday afternoon, including many elderly people from assisted living
facilities. Donald Fisher, 78, said he was wheeled into the center
Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“I can stand up, but I can’t walk,” Fisher told the AP. “I think that
the city of Pasadena did a marvelous job.”</p>
<p>EJ Soto and her family were not so lucky. They fled their Altadena
home early Wednesday and also sought shelter at the Pasadena Convention
Center, but by the time they arrived, all the cots had been taken.</p>
<p>“I had one hour of sleep, so it’s been a really bad, really bad day,”
Soto told the AP.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, poweroutage.us reported that there were more than 1.5
million customers without power across Southern California on Wednesday
afternoon, as firefighters continued to try to bring the fires under
control.</p>
<p>As a safety precaution, power companies will sometimes shut off the
power when communities are battling extreme environmental conditions to
prevent the equipment from sparking a fire.</p>
<p>Washington is supporting California’s firefighting efforts with four
U.S. Forest Service large air tankers and an additional tanker in on
route. The federal government has also helped the firefighting efforts
with 10 helicopters. Meanwhile, dozens of the Forest Service fire
engines are ready to be deployed.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

The Greater Los Angeles area is awash in smoke and ash as multiple fires
burn in and around the city. It’s too soon to assess the overall
pollution impacts from this rare January event, but we know the smoke is
filled with tiny particles known as PM2.5, one of the most pernicious
public health villains, associated with increased risk of respiratory
and heart disease and premature death.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/air-quality-index-what-you-need-to-know" target="_self"><u>tightened</u></a>
the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM2.5 for the first time
since 2012. The South Coast Air Quality District, which contains Los
Angeles, is known for having some of the worst air quality in the
country. State officials have already deemed it to be
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Staff_Report_PM2.5_Area_Designation_Recommendations_2024_Annual_PM2.5_NAAQS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>out
of compliance</u></a> — and that’s without even counting pollution from
major wildfires. But new research raises questions about whether
complying with the new standard will even be possible in many places due
to the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Marshall Burke, who
<a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/8187/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
the not-yet-peer-reviewed findings</u></a> in December, is a Stanford
University researcher who has spent the past several years investigating
how wildfires have affected PM2.5 exposure in the U.S. In a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06522-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023
paper published in </u><u><em><em>Nature</em></em></u></a>, he and his
co-authors found that over just six years, wildfire smoke eroded decades
of air quality improvements throughout the country. The trend was
particularly bad in Western states, of course — some of which saw more
than half of their gains erased. The pre-print of the new paper updates
those findings to include data from 2023. But it also goes deeper on
what this means in light of the new air quality standards. The authors
find that 34% of air monitoring stations registered PM2.5 above the
regulatory limit because of smoke in at least one of the last five
years.
</p>
<p>
Technically, wildfire smoke is completely unregulated. Jurisdictions can
request to exclude “exceptional events,” such as days when PM2.5 spiked
due to wildfire, from their calculations. But as the “smoke season” has
grown longer and more places experience more days with degraded air
quality due to smoke, local officials have not been requesting more
exemptions. The researchers analyzed applications for exemptions since
2019, and found that they were more common on days with higher levels of
wildfire smoke, but were still infrequent overall.
</p>
<p>
One reason might be that local pollution control officers don’t always
recognize when smoke has pushed pollution over the limit on a particular
day versus other factors. There is also a “substantial resource burden
involved” in demonstrating the influence of wildfire smoke on ambient
air quality, the paper says. Also, as smoke becomes more commonplace, it
may be more difficult for officials to make the case that a given smoke
event is “exceptional.”
</p>
<p>
In any case, if this low rate of applications for exemptions continues,
many more regions may find themselves to be out of compliance with the
new PM2.5 standard.
</p>
<p>
In the paper’s discussion section, the researchers posit that as
wildfire smoke continues to get worse, either of two possible scenarios
could play out. In the first, air quality districts affected by smoke
get better at applying for exemptions and therefore achieve compliance
with the Clean Air Act, even as local air quality and public health
deteriorate. In the second, they find other ways to stay in compliance
with the standards, such as by tightening pollution caps on power plants
and factories. “Such mitigation could be cost effective in many regions
where abatement costs remain low relative to the benefits of further air
quality improvements,” the authors write, “but could become onerous if
wildfire smoke concentrations continue to grow, as is expected under a
warming climate.”
</p>
<p>
The first scenario is bleak, and the second comes with a pretty big
caveat. But those aren’t the only options — we can also reduce the risk
of wildfires with better land-use planning and management.
Unfortunately, promising strategies like controlled burns can push PM2.5
levels over the standard, and those are
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/forest-service-chief-prescribed-burns-conflict-with-air-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
exempt from reporting</u></a> the way that wildfires are — creating a
perverse incentive not to do them.

<p class="drop-caps">
“It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, wherever the
wind blows,” the great Los Angeles chronicler Joan Didion
<a href="https://pasadena-library.net/adult_services/2017/the-santa-ana-winds-in-literature/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>once
wrote</u></a> of the Santa Ana winds. It also happens to be the season
of wildfires. The winds
“<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=354832315066989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bedeviled</u></a>”
efforts to fight the deadly Woolsey fire in 2018 and created “dangerous
conditions” when they whipped the nearly 20,000-acre Mountain fire in
Ventura County
<a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/mountain-fire-a-suburban-firestorm-due-to-santa-ana-winds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this
past fall</u></a>. And they were blowing, too, when a spark of unknown
origin ignited
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
now 23,000 acres</u></a> of wildfire burning through the suburbs of Los
Angeles.
</p>
<p>
Though steeped in mystery and superstition (writers call them
<a href="https://www.pbssocal.org/shows/lost-la/the-devil-wind-a-brief-history-of-the-santa-anas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
“devil winds”</u></a>), the Santa Ana winds are common in Los Angeles
during this time of year. (Scientists call them simply “offshore
winds.”) The phenomenon is caused by winter’s cold, dry air becoming
lodged in the bowl of the Great Basin, where it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_High#:~:text=Often%2C%20in%20the%20winter%20months,front%20on%20its%20leading%20edge." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forms
a high-pressure area</u></a>. That clockwise-moving air wants to escape,
and it does so by rushing down and south through the mountain passes to
the low-pressure area on the coast: Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
The wind can pick up a lot of speed — on Wednesday morning, gusts topped
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/santa-ana-winds-palisades-california-wildfires-d625bd04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100
miles per hour</u></a> in the San Gabriel Mountains. It can also become
drier and warmer — by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit — as it rushes
through the passes toward the coast, which is what gives the Santa Anas
their signature warmth, which so many find disquieting.
</p>
<h3>
What makes the Santa Ana winds happening now unique?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
For one thing, the current Santa Anas are on the upper end of the
spectrum for velocity, which is part of why they have such a significant
impact — and cause firefighters so much trouble. For another, there is a
“rare placement of upper-level jet stream winds” giving the system a
more northerly flow as opposed to the usual north-easterly orientation,
Scott Capps, an atmospheric scientist and the head of Atmospheric Data
Solutions, a forecasting firm, told me in an email. As a result, “many
areas that are typically not impacted by Santa Ana winds were impacted.”
</p>
<h3>
Does climate change affect the Santa Anas?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
“Logically, it makes sense that climate change will impact the frequency
and characteristics of [the Santa Anas],” Capps told me. However, “due
to the complexity of the environment, we cannot blame one single factor
for any extreme weather event.” The more obvious connection between the
L.A. fires and climate change is the lack of precipitation during what
is supposed to be the region’s wet season; some parts of southern
California have
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" target="_blank"><u>received
just 10% of their normal rainfall</u></a> since October, making the area
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fire-preparedness" target="_self"><u>ripe
for a fire</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Scientists
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/california-s-fire-fanning-santa-ana-winds-may-not-get-any-better-climate-change" target="_blank"><u>used
to think</u></a> that inland warming would reduce the cold
weather-related high pressure in the Great Basin and weaken the Santa
Anas. While it does appear that so-called “cold” Santa Anas — caused by
air in the Great Basin that is so cold initially that it’s still chilly
when it reaches L.A., and which account for about a third of all Santa
Anas — are becoming less frequent, the more traditional “warm” winds
that are associated with wildfires
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/california-s-fire-fanning-santa-ana-winds-may-not-get-any-better-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>don’t
actually seem</u></a> to bear out this hypothesis. Instead, they “are
spread uniformly over the seven decades of record,” the authors of
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-021-05802-z#Abs1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
2021 study</u></a> wrote.
</p>
<p>
If climate change is doing anything to warm or accelerate Santa Anas,
the data would appear to suggest“an increasing potential of warmer and
drier [Santa Ana winds] to dry out coastal vegetation and, particularly
in anomalously dry winters, enhance the coastal wildfire season even
into spring,” the authors went on.
</p>
<p>
While it’s far too soon to link the California disaster to climate
change, the study’s authors now seem prescient: dry vegetation and an
unusually dry winter both go far in explaining why this week’s fires are
so
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires" target="_self"><u>destructive</u></a>.

President Jimmy Carter lies in state at US Capitol</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to come
to the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to former President Jimmy
Carter, who lay in state Wednesday in the heart of American democracy
ahead of his pomp-filled state funeral.</p>
<p>Mourners, who included numerous elected officials and Vice President
Kamala Harris, highlighted the achievements and the humanity of
the100-year-old, who died last month.</p>
<p>David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict
Resolution at George Mason University, said that the former president
obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol
to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes.</p>
<p>“He had such an impact on so many people,” he said. “His work on
advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting
our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very
important things to me.”</p>
<p>The former president’s flag-draped coffin arrived in the Capitol
rotunda Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s national funeral.</p>
<p>In that soaring space – where only about 50 Americans have been
recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader
Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: “Navy
veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United
States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace
and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his
creator and his fellow man.”</p>
<p>And Vice President Harris – who a day earlier, in this building,
certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s
policy.</p>
<p>“He was the first president of the United States to have a
comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first
federal support for clean energy,” she said Tuesday. “He also passed
over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental
protection. And more than doubled the size of America’s national
parks.”</p>
<p>Carter, who served as the 39th president, died December 29 at the age
of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia.
Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny
roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta,
the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his
state funeral.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant
to them.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was
“a real moral person.”</p>
<p>“He taught Sunday school – I did, too!” she said, smiling. “But I
think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s
president.”</p>
<p>South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that
while he did not align with Carter politically, “President Carter was a
good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved
America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t
(dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his
country.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat
on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We may never see his like again, you know we can all do well to try
to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,” Biden said in late December
after receiving news of Carter’s death.</p>
<p>Analysts say the two men have a few things in common.</p>
<p>“There’s an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be
a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,”
Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on
Zoom. “And that’s never a reflection of the right combination of
politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents
put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for
that.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s funeral will bring together President Biden and former
presidents, including Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump.
When asked what Carter and the next and previous president have in
common, Galston paused.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know how to begin to answer that question,” he said
finally. “The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think
of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as
outsiders.”</p>
<p>And now, here lies this outsider, decades after his presidency ended,
inside his nation’s most venerated space.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
January is one of the worst months of the year for wildfires — in
southern Australia. Not in the metro area of Los Angeles, where it is,
technically, supposed to be the rainy season.
</p>
<p>
But try telling a fire that it’s unseasonal.
</p>
<p>
At the time of this writing, three wildfires are burning in the Los
Angeles area, mostly uncontained: the nearly 3,000-acre Palisades fire
in the hills between Santa Monica and Malibu; the 500-acre Hurst fire in
Sylmar, northwest of downtown L.A.; and the 2,300-acre Eaton fire
outside of Pasadena. The fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings —
including, apparently, the home of reality TV royals
<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/heidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-react-to-palisades-wildfires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Heidi
Montag and Spencer Pratt</u></a> — and
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
least two people have died</u></a>. Emergency management officials told
an additional 30,000 people to evacuate immediately, a number that is
likely to climb as dry, windy conditions worsen throughout the day on
the West Coast. Though it’s still early in the unfolding disaster,
forecasters expect fire weather to continue through at least Thursday,
and some experts are already saying the event may end up being
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/los-angeles-pacific-palisades-eaton-wildfires-01-08-25/index.html?t=1736358986008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
costliest wildfire on record</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s not the case, however, that this unusual storm has taken emergency
management or the public by surprise. “We’ve been advertising this event
for several days and talking about how serious it could be starting last
week,” Kristen Allison, a fire management specialist with the Southern
California Geographic Area Coordination Center, told me. Given the high
Santa Ana winds —which, with their
<a href="https://x.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1877001296735051828" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100-mile-per-hour
gusts</u></a>, were strong enough to blow unimpeded over the San Gabriel
mountains and hit typically sheltered areas like Pasadena — and the low
humidity, forecasters saw all the classic warning signs of wildfire well
in advance.
</p>
<p>
It’s not the wind or dry air that is so atypical for January, though.
“We haven’t had significant rain since April, so we’ve been dry for
eight or nine months,” Allison went on. “Our fuels are basically bone
dry at this point.”
</p>
<p>
And there is <em><em>a lot</em></em> of fuel waiting to burn after the
region’s wet spring — a dangerous situation created by the see-sawing
between extremes that is typical of climate change.
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/drought-water-fire-california-20011706.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Earlier
this year</u></a>, the U.S. Drought Monitor classified many parts of the
state as being in a “moderate” drought, a trend that also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>has
strong links to climate change</u></a> and will have dried out the
vegetation in the hills.

Making matters worse, the winter storms that usually hit the L.A. area
this time of year have tracked north, soaking the Pacific Northwest and
Northern California instead. L.A.’s fires, then, are “not so much a
temperature story,” Max Moritz, a cooperative extension wildfire
specialist at U.C. Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science
&amp; Management, told me. “This is really more of a precipitation and
climate change story.” All the landscape was ever going to need, in
other words, was a spark.
</p>
<p>
It might be a long time before we discover what
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson" target="_self"><u>this
particular spark</u></a> was. But it also doesn’t really matter. “Once
fires like this start, there is not a whole lot firefighters can do,”
Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of
Nevada, Reno, told me. “The pre-positioning of resources — all of that
was there. But you see the impossibility of the task at hand once the
fires get going.”
</p>
<p>
Allison agreed that few who live in the fire-prone hills outside of
Malibu or Pasadena are likely to have ignored the warnings just because
they’ve otherwise been lucky
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_Fire" target="_blank"><u>lately</u></a>.
“People know that if we haven’t had rain in months and months and
months, and we got the wind coming — they know this is fire weather,”
Allison said. The lack of significant casualties so far might be
attributed to the fact that as awful as the <em><em>physical</em></em>
destruction is, this is also what southern California
<em><em>does</em></em>, even if it’s an unusual time of year.
</p>
<p>
But Scott Capps, an atmospheric scientist and the head of Atmospheric
Data Solutions, a forecasting firm, pointed out to me in an email that
just because we expect fire weather, “we cannot predict where and when a
wildfire ignition will happen.” As he explained, the terrain of southern
California is complex and extraordinarily difficult to accurately model;
in a fast-moving situation like the fires in L.A., the advantages of
predicting fire weather quickly reach their limits. Especially when a
wildfire starts burning between fuel-rich homes, entire neighborhoods
can quickly go up in smoke.
</p>
<p>
The late author and urban theorist Mike Davis once argued that
<a href="https://longreads.com/2018/12/04/the-case-for-letting-malibu-burn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>we
should let Malibu burn</u></a>. “After every major California blaze,
homeowners and their representatives take shelter in the belief that if
wildfire can’t be prevented, nonetheless, its destructiveness can be
tamed,” he wrote, adding: “Yet, as a contemporary Galileo might say …
‘still it burns.’”
</p>
<p>
Davis was writing in 1998, a time when he described fire season as “late
August to early October.” Many would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-last-fire-season-manjula-martin#:~:text=fire%20season%20isn%E2%80%99t%20really%20a%20thing%20anymore." target="_self"><u>argue
now</u></a> that there isn’t such a thing as a fire “season” anymore.
Allison warned me that the forecast looks favorable for fires through
Friday, and that “additional winds are coming next week” and “we’re not
going to see rain anytime soon.” At a certain point, Davis’ wry
pessimism might not seem not so crass.
</p>
<p>
Moritz, though, wanted to be clear in distinguishing between the
inevitabilities. “We have built communities right up into and against
flammable landscapes, so yes, it is inevitable that many of these
neighborhoods are going to experience a fire,” he explained. But “is it
inevitable that we would have this many home losses, or have to evacuate
this many people, and who knows how many fatalities may end up emerging
— is <em><em>that</em></em> part inevitable? No.”
</p>
<p>
Predicting fires is, of course, <em><em>vitally</em></em> important:
Warnings and outlooks prevent deaths, promote
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/how-to-protect-home-from-wildfire" target="_self"><u>home-hardening
and resilience measures</u></a>, and help encourage smooth evacuations
that, in turn, keep first responders safe. But when you have an
alignment of conditions like these, prediction will never equal
prevention. Moritz argued that we need to move beyond “preventing”
fires, anyway — it’s more important that we begin to think of land use
and urban planning as public health measures. “We need to have urban
design standards that explicitly address the need for more survivable
communities” in southern California, he told me.
</p>
<p>
Because of the climate, because of bad luck, because of the folly of
wanting to live somewhere with that perfect Pacific view — California
was going to catch fire. “I think there are going to be some tragic
outcomes that we hear about,” Moritz said, “and if there are any lessons
that we can take away, it’s that we have to learn to coexist with this
kind of inevitable natural hazard.”

<p class="drop-caps">
Ask me one thing I love about living in Los Angeles and there’s a good
chance I’d say, <em><em>Because it’s wild</em></em>. The giant city park
near us is no flat, grassy plane for picnicking and Frisbee, but a
rugged expanse of coyotes and the occasional
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/puma-profiles-p-22.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mountain
lion</u></a>, God rest his soul. Outside my window loom the San Gabriel
Mountains, loaded with hiking trails.
</p>
<p>
This is a place integrated with nature. People hike after brunch. But,
as we must say at times like this, there is a cost to that.
</p>
<p>
The skies are dark today after
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/pacific-palisades-fire-updates-los-angeles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two
enormous wildfires</u></a> sprang up overnight, sparked and fueled by
ferocious Santa Anas. The winds, which blow hot air from the inland
Great Basin toward the ocean, typically bring unseasonably warm days and
fire danger in autumn. This January incident brought gusts as high as
100 miles per hour that rattled our windows and downed trees across
town.
</p>
<p>
First came the fire in the
<a href="https://x.com/JonVigliotti/status/1877020919475884110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pacific
Palisades</u></a>, the area between the city’s ritzy western beach towns
and the oft-burning hills of Malibu. The Palisades fire turned into a
beast in a hurry as tens of thousands of people abandoned their homes
and parts of Santa Monica went on high alert. Bulldozers
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c24n4pz6p2eo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bulldozed</u></a>
abandoned cars to make way for fire trucks.
</p>
<p>
Later in the evening, a second blaze began in Eaton Canyon, whose
waterfall makes it one of the busiest hiking destinations in town. Eaton
spread quickly in the dry mountains above Pasadena, forcing evacuations
and alerts in the cities like Altadena and La Cañada Flintridge and
creating a dark cloud of smoke over the San Gabriel Valley. At Caltech,
where I work, the campus is wind-beaten and classes are canceled, as
they are at plenty of area school districts.
</p>
<p>
L.A. woke up Wednesday morning to find itself between two fires. And
those two enormous events, each of which has consumed thousands of acres
by now, aren’t the end of it. Another major wildfire broke out north of
the city near Santa Clarita. Smaller blazes have popped up all around
town like a cruel game of Whack-a-Mole — in Pasadena, in Culver City,
and close to here, by Dodger Stadium. Mercifully, most of these
flare-ups were extinguished before they could spread.
</p>
<p>
In social media posts, residents are recommending to each other the
excellent
<a href="https://www.watchduty.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Watch
Duty</u></a> app that tracks fires as they develop. To have that on your
phone this week is to be barraged by messages about new evacuation
orders and new fires blazing up. With the whole region bone-dry and the
gusts unrelenting, the city suddenly feels like a minefield. Any expanse
of tree or scrub could be the next one to catch fire. As I watched out
my window last night to see the mountain flames dance in the distance, a
power line explosion in the foreground darkened part of a neighborhood
across the river.
</p>
<p>
Such gloom was already a signature part of late summer and autumn in
California, when the months of near-zero precipitation create a
tinderbox in the hills and the mountains. Now, wildfires are seasonally
unbounded. No significant rain has fallen in November or December. That,
plus, an extremely hot and dry summer, led to the parched conditions
that combined with freak winds to set the city ablaze during what used
to be a wet month.
</p>
<p>
This is the way of things now. During the past two winters, El Niño
conditions dropped heavy rainfall around Los Angeles that added snowpack
to the mountains and eased drought conditions in the area. This winter
we haven’t been so fortunate. In a climate-changed L.A. with less rain
during its rainy season, the delicate balance of the city starts to tilt
out of balance. It’s harder and harder to have neighborhoods in and up
against the mountains, when wildfires seem to come so much more often.
</p>
<p>
These events inevitably trigger a wave of “How could you live in such a
place?” Of course, you could ask the same thing of the tornadoes that
sweep through where I’m originally from, or the hurricanes of the Gulf
Coast. Every place has its disasters, and major wildfires are growing
more common everywhere, not just in California. Retreat is an illusion.
</p>
<p>
What matters, here and elsewhere, is resilience. Not just the
psychological kind that means we recover and come back, but the
practical, logistical kind, like decentralized electrical grids that are
less vulnerable to natural disasters and help people keep the lights on
when the worst happens. We must build for the unexpected now that the
freak cataclysm isn’t a freak event anymore.

Growing Push to Ban Renewable Energy in Oklahoma</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTUwNDY1NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDY3MTE4NX0.GWD8fKDO5LhgYIucHSvau9f8JLfd57jAtFk7zXYYwDU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a nascent, concerted effort to make Oklahoma the first state to
ban new renewable energy projects. And it’s picking up steam.
</p>
<p>
Across the U.S., activism against wind and solar energy has only grown
in intensity, power, and scope in tandem with the recent renewables
boom. This is in direct contrast to hopes many in the climate movement
had that these technologies would become <em><em>more</em></em> popular
as they entered communities historically hostile to the idea of
switching away from fossil fuels. If anything, grassroots angst toward
the energy transition has only surged in many pockets of the country
since passage of the nation’s first climate law – Inflation Reduction
Act – in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Nowhere is this more true than Oklahoma, which on paper resembles a
breadbasket of possibilities for the “green” economy. Oklahoma is the
nation’s
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=OK#9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third
largest generator</u></a> of wind energy, home to a burgeoning solar
energy sector, a
<a href="https://h2alo.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potential
hydrogen hub</u></a>, and maybe even the nation’s
<a href="https://ictnews.org/news/native-activists-fighting-nickel-and-cobalt-refinery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
refinery for cobalt</u></a>, a rare metal used in electric vehicles. Yet
yesterday, hundreds of people flocked to Oklahoma City, filled a giant
hall in the state’s capitol building to the brim, and rallied for the
state’s governor Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order to stop new
wind and solar energy facilities from being built.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome Oklahoma, for braving the cold out there into this very warm
and receiving Capitol. And y’know what? Our warmth today was not brought
to us by green energy,” Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond told
the rally audience.
</p>
<p>
It’s exceedingly likely these folks won’t get an executive order any
time soon. Oklahoma Republican governor, Kevin Stitt, has embraced these
technologies as job creators. “Oklahoma is an oil and gas state through
and through, but we also generate about 47% of our electricity from
renewable sources,” he wrote
<a href="https://x.com/GovStitt/status/1827063872353923552" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
X</u></a> in August. “I just don’t think the government should pick
winners and losers or force us to choose between one or the other.”
Weeks ago, he
<a href="https://oklahoma.gov/governor/newsroom/newsroom/2024/nov2024/governor-stitt-signs-energy-mou-with-ambassador-of-denmark.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a memorandum of understanding</u></a> between the state and the nation
of Denmark to collaborate more on wind energy.
</p>
<p>
But the political gusts are blowing in the direction of a ban. Exhibit
A: Drummond, who it’s
<a href="https://www.news9.com/story/67461d65ef6c021a9ebcd99d/oklahomas-2026-governors-race:-key-figures-who-have-been-speculated-to-run" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rumored
may run</u></a> to replace Stitt and who at the rally pledged to work
with legislators to pass a bill ending the deal with “quasi-socialist”
Denmark. The rally also featured Oklahoma’s Education Secretary Ryan
Walters, whose name has also been included in gubernatorial chatter.
</p>
<p>
This uprising in Oklahoma has been happening for quite some time,
without much fanfare due to a persistent and pernicious
<a href="https://www.kgou.org/politics-and-government/2023-01-03/oklahoma-news-deserts-data-shows-voting-sagged-in-orphan-counties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>news
desert problem</u></a> in the state (and
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/news-deserts-climate-disaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many
others</u></a>). Like other states, it is becoming more commonplace for
towns and counties there
<a href="https://www.okenergytoday.com/2024/12/legislators-take-a-stand-against-a-possible-mcintosh-county-wind-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
face pressure</u></a> to
<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/tired-of-being-taken-advantage-of-officials-voice-support-for-wind-farm-moratorium-lincoln-county-turbines-power-energy-apex-clean-green-enel-robbie-jeff-mccommas-sandstone-hills-cedar-run-commissioner-board-garber-wellington-aquifer-iowa-tribe-jacob" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support
moratoriums</u></a> against developing new projects, and GOP lawmakers
are also increasingly facing primaries over offering any support to wind
or solar energy, or even just remaining neutral on whether projects get
built. One such casualty in the last election cycle was Kevin Wallace,
the GOP chair of the Appropriations and Budget Committee in the
statehouse, who
<a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/government/2024/08/22/oklahoma-elections-2024-runoffs-kevin-wallace-jim-shaw/74874494007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>was
dethroned</u></a> by a political newcomer – Jim Shaw, who ran heavily on
anti-renewables policies, including a statewide moratorium.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a groundswell,” said Pam Kingfisher, an environmental activist in
northeast Oklahoma. Kingfisher is a Democrat but she has her own
concerns with the environmental impacts that wind turbines could have in
her community, the town of Kansas. So she’s grateful for this uprising.
</p>
<p>
“They’re attacking their own people and being very effective and I’m
standing back going, ‘hey yes, take them on.’”
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say, these activists feel emboldened by the primary wins
and Trump’s election. Charity Linch, chair of the Oklahoma chapter of
the Republican National Committee, told me she doesn’t believe the
“pro-renewable Republican” will exist much longer in the state.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe that’s going to continue in Oklahoma,” Linch told me.
“If they haven’t figured it out yet, they will very soon.”
</p>
<p>
Linch is the proud founder of Freedom Brigades, a grassroots network of
activists with members in several states. The Freedom Brigade chapters
for two counties conflicted over wind – McIntosh and Pittsburg – were
instrumental in organizing the rally. Linch said Freedom Brigades also
helped support some of the successful primary challengers in this past
election cycle, and that her members were partially responsible for the
Oklahoma GOP
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/oklahoma-gop-condemns-censures-lankford-border-negotiations/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>censuring

die</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
From talking to Linch, it’s clear to me that renewable developers should
pay close attention to the Oklahoma uprising. So should Washington,
because as talk in Congress proceeds toward changing the Inflation
Reduction Act, rest assured some of these people will contact their
members of Congress when the time comes. And you should expect the same
from the myriad of anti-renewables activists in other states fighting
solar and wind projects in their own backyards.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Getting Red In The Face</strong>
</p>
<p>
Why is this rebellion happening in Oklahoma? Well, if you ask
Oklahomans, they’ll count the reasons.
</p>
<p>
Activists involved in planning the rally told me the biggest reason for
the uproar was that solar and wind projects aren’t bringing the ample
jobs developers and policymakers promise, making their presence in
communities more difficult to stomach. Others point to environmental
concerns, from the impacts these projects can have on species to the
chemicals used to make them. Like Saundra Traywick, a donkey farmer who
attended the rally and author of a
<a href="http://change.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Change.org
petition</u></a> supporting a state renewables ban that has more than
3,000 signatures. The petition claims wind turbines present “hazards to
the health, safety, and welfare of the people.”
</p>
<p>
“They resort to calling us names instead of listening to us,” Traywick
told me. “None of us wanted to get involved in any of this. We didn’t
want to be involved in politics. These are farmers that are dealing with
freezing temperatures,” referencing the temperature outside the rally.
</p>
<p>
There’s a serious issue of tribal opposition, given a 2020 Supreme Court
ruling that found nearly half of all lands in Oklahoma fall under some
form of tribal sovereignty. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/sunzia-lawsuit-blm" target="_self"><u>explained
last year</u></a>, this means developers may also need to get mineral
rights approvals from tribal government bodies. Two weeks ago, a federal
judge
<a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/justice-judge-orders-removal-of-8-400-acre-wind-farm-on-osage-reservation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered
the removal</u></a> of 84 wind turbines on those grounds, stating the
developer Enel Green Power failed to get adequate permission from the
Osage Nation.
</p>
<p>
Some involved in this push for a renewables ban are also open about
another rationale: They want to help oil and gas production, a key
source of employment in the state.
</p>
<p>
“Why are we as a state being forced to fund our own demise essentially,
with our federal taxpayer dollars, to prop up an industry that’s
literally killing the backbone industry of our state, which is oil and
gas?” Shaw said on <em><em>Breitbar</em></em>t’s Conservative Review
<a href="https://zeno.fm/podcast/conservative-review-with-daniel-horowitz/episodes/colonizing-red-states-with-green-grift-12-4-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>podcast
in December</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
To anyone who believes, as the vast
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/07/hottest-year-record-2024-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>majority
of scientists say</u></a>, that
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/what-is-latest-science-telling-us-about-climate-change-2025-01-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
change is real</u></a> and to

<a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quickly

far fewer carbon emissions</u></a>, these may all look like terrible
reasons.
</p>
<p>
But if you don’t believe that climate change is real, or you believe
it’s an overrated problem… renewables are just a much harder sell.
</p>
<p>
“Most of us do not believe we need to reduce our CO2 to begin with,”
NeAnne Clinton, an
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB6kgDGKCrc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>activist
fighting</u></a> a large
<a href="https://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/skeleton-creek-project.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NextEra
solar-plus-battery project</u></a> in Garfield County, Oklahoma, told
me. “We know that it’s a scam and we don’t support it. And we don’t
support using our taxpayer money for something that we didn’t have a
voice in.”
</p>
<p>
Cheyenne Branscum, chair of Sierra Club’s Oklahoma chapter, told me it
is difficult for supporters of renewable energy to counter this
insurgent populist movement against the sector. Part of the dilemma is
that environmental activism itself is seen by many of the state’s most
red-blooded Republicans as a “radical” act, so if climate advocates were
to organize counter protests it would likely backfire. When asked how
her organization and others could best deal with the anti-renewables
sentiment rising in her state, she talked about
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/oklahoma/programs/education" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>education
programs</u></a> – not confrontation.
</p>
<p>
“We’re not going to change anything at the state capital,” Branscum told
me. “All a counter rally is going to do is make them have more
opportunities to make us into a meme. They’re going to have some angry
picture out there with a sign and be labeled some crazy radical that
doesn’t care about their community. And it is unfortunately a hurdle.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Sooners’ Warning Shot</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Oklahoma rebellion should be cold comfort for anyone who buys into
one of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_self"><u>implicit
political principles</u></a> behind the country’s first climate law –
the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
Whether folks in D.C. want to admit it or not, the American
anti-renewables revolution is rising up as Donald Trump retakes the
White House and it is going to try and make its own impact on the
Inflation Reduction Act. While much ado has been made about how the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/16/climate/clean-energy-investment-republicans/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelming
majority</u></a> of monetary benefits from the IRA are supporting
investments in Republican-controlled states, as veteran lobbyist Frank
Maisano put it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>to
me last year</u></a>, “Businesses will support many things that they
have their tentacles into and Republicans will support many things that
are going on in their districts that constituents like.”
</p>
<p>
“The reality is, if you’re going to try to repeal it,” Maisano said,
“you’re going to have to do it through Congress and a lot of the action
in the energy transition is in Republican districts. It becomes a
constituent issue.”
</p>
<p>
What if many Republican constituents simply don’t like these new
investments, in spite of the promises of jobs or tax benefits? What
happens if Republicans in Congress are primaried simply for allowing
solar and wind to keep getting federal tax breaks?
</p>
<p>
None of this surprises Nathan Jensen, a Texas University professor
specializing in resource politics, who believes Oklahoma will only be
the first to face a movement for a state-wide ban on new renewables.
Just look at Texas where, like Oklahoma, the energy sector has become a
panacea for wind and solar energy but many GOP policymakers
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self"><u>have
turned</u></a> on
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/01/chapter-313-texas-renewables-economic-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>economic
development packages</u></a> for new renewables. A state-wide ban hasn’t
been discussed yet, but Jensen can imagine the idea gaining traction.
</p>
<p>
Jensen said he believes the organizing on platforms like Facebook only
tells part of the story. Clearly, he says, a lot of people are joining
that cause because the industry’s grown large enough that people are
hearing from the farm or town next to theirs about solar and wind
projects. And whether climate advocates want to hear it or not, these
people are not loving what they’re hearing. Solar and wind projects
don’t create
<a href="https://graham.umich.edu/media/pubs/Wind-Turbine-Economic-Impact-Local-Employment-46932.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>that</em></em></u></a>
many jobs after they’re built. They do create a flurry of construction,
but that’s a form of labor that leaves when it’s done and is often
resented by neighbors, leading to disputes over dust, noise, or water.
Then there’s the tax abatements for developers, which aggrieved
residents see as taxpayer dollars going to large companies without their
say – precisely the message gaining traction in Oklahoma.
</p>
<p>
This means places that seem safe for renewable developers are no longer
safe and companies need to be really careful about how they approach
community benefits. It’s not something you can just say – you really
need to deliver what you promise.
</p>
<p>
“I know there’s a lot of news about organized anti-solar, which clearly
happens, but also there’s this organic opposition that happens where
it’s like, <em><em>‘You’re asking for how much from our school
district?</em></em>’” Jensen said. “Some of it is organized Facebook
groups against solar but I think there is a lot of frustration.”

id="taliban-refute-trumps-claims-on-us-financial-aid-to-afghanistan">Taliban
refute Trump’s claims on US financial aid to Afghanistan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday denied
President-elect Donald Trump’s assertions that they have received
billions of dollars in U.S. financial aid since regaining control of the
country. </p>
<p>Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, responded to
Trump’s claims by asserting that the Kabul administration neither
anticipates nor seeks any assistance from the United States. </p>
<p>“In reality, the United States has not provided a single penny to the
Islamic Emirate,” Fitrat stated, referring to Afghanistan’s official
name under Taliban rule. “Instead, it has confiscated and frozen
billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of
Afghanistan.”  </p>
<p>The Taliban’s sharp response followed Trump’s news conference in
Florida on Tuesday, when he was asked to comment on the alleged monthly
payments of millions of dollars by the Biden administration to the de
facto Afghan rulers. </p>
<p>“It’s not even believable. Billions of dollars, not millions —
billions. We pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban
Afghanistan,” Trump stated. “This can’t be allowed to happen.” </p>
<p>Fitrat claimed that the U.S. funds in question were primarily
utilized for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the
relocation and resettlement of their Afghan allies. </p>
<p>“A portion of this money may have also been used under the pretext of
‘humanitarian aid’ by international organizations. … [The] U.S. directed
all this money to Afghanistan, primarily for its own interests, and now
exploits it as propaganda against the Islamic Emirate,” the Taliban
spokesperson alleged. </p>
<p>The controversy surrounding provision of financial aid to the Taliban
intensified following a Jan. 2 letter by Congressman Tim Burchett to
President-elect Trump, which expressed concern over foreign aid being
directed to the de facto Afghan authorities. </p>
<p>“These cash shipments are auctioned off, and after that, they are
nearly impossible to track. This is how the Taliban is being funded and
plans to fund terrorism around the world,” warned Burchett. “The United
States of America should not fund its enemies abroad.” </p>
<p>He cited U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as having confirmed
that non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan had paid nearly $10
million in foreign aid to the Taliban in taxes. </p>
<p>The Taliban swept back to power in August 2021, prompting Washington
and the West at large to suspend development aid to the country and
effectively isolate the Afghan banking sector, freezing billions of
dollars of central bank assets in the United States. </p>
<p>The flow of humanitarian assistance, however, has primarily remained
intact under the United Nations’ supervision. </p>
<p>The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) refutes
allegations that some of the funds it receives for humanitarian
operations are being diverted to the Taliban. </p>
<p>UNAMA has maintained that it transports cash into the country for the
use of U.N. agencies and “approved and vetted” humanitarian partners to
assist millions of Afghans needing support. </p>
<p>The mission has emphasized that all cash is deposited in designated
U.N. accounts in a private bank before being distributed directly to the
United Nations and other entities. It has also clarified that none of
the cash brought into the country is deposited in the Central Bank of
Afghanistan or provided to de facto Taliban authorities by the U.N.</p>

id="european-union-rebuffs-trumps-designs-on-greenland-takeover">European
Union rebuffs Trump’s designs on Greenland takeover</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The European Union on Wednesday dismissed U.S. President-elect Donald
Trump’s refusal to rule out a military attack to take control of
Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland as “wild hypothetical
stuff,” while confirming that EU states would be compelled to defend the
island if Trump invaded it.</p>
<p>Trump, set to be inaugurated for a second, nonconsecutive term in the
White House on Jan. 20, refused at a news conference Tuesday to rule out
military action to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island and
earlier had vowed to slap high tariffs on Denmark if it refused to cede
control.</p>
<p>The Brussels-based 27-nation bloc, long a U.S. ally, however,
attempted to avoid being drawn into a verbal sparring match with Trump,
saying it was “looking forward” to working with the incoming
administration.</p>
<p>As for Trump’s refusal to rule out military action to take over
Greenland, a European Commission spokesperson said, “We are talking
about fairly wild hypothetical stuff about an administration that hasn’t
come in yet.”</p>
<p>Another spokesperson added that the sovereignty of states had to be
respected “as a matter of principle.”</p>
<p>Asked if Greenland was covered by a mutual defense clause binding EU
members to assist each other in case of attack, commission spokesperson
Paula Pinho said that was the case.</p>
<p>“But we are indeed speaking of something extremely theoretical on
which we will not want to elaborate,” she said.</p>
<p>Greenland is a mineral-rich autonomous territory of EU member Denmark
and an associated territory of the EU.</p>
<p>Trump has long publicly hypothesized about taking over Greenland,
saying Tuesday, “We need Greenland for national security purposes,”
arguing that Denmark should give it up to “protect the free world.”</p>
<p>Aside from minerals on the island, it is a strategic Arctic shipping
portal, especially as ice floes melt at the top of the world as the
planet warms.</p>
<p>Trump earlier in the day wrote on social media that the potential
American takeover of Greenland “is a deal that must happen” and uploaded
photos of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who was visiting
Greenland.</p>
<p>“MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN,” Trump added.</p>
<p>Panama and Canada</p>
<p>At his news conference, Trump also refused to rule out military
action to secure control of the Panama Canal and use economic force
against neighboring Canada to gain the upper hand in trade deals or
merge the two countries.</p>
<p>“Canada and the United States, that would really be something,” Trump
said. “You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look
at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national
security.”</p>
<p>Trump posited the possibility that Canada should be the 51st U.S.
state, a proposition that outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau immediately rejected.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become
part of the United States,” Trudeau said.</p>
<p>Germany and France</p>
<p>Aside from the EU’s rejection of Trump eyeing a Greenland takeover,
EU members Germany and France individually also rebuffed the suggestion
by the incoming U.S. leader.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed surprise at Trump’s comments,
saying European partners agreed that the inviolability of borders was a
fundamental principle of international law.</p>
<p>“This principle applies and is a foundation of our peaceful order,”
Scholz told reporters.</p>
<p>“In my discussions with our European partners, a certain lack of
understanding has emerged with regard to recent statements from the
USA,” Scholz said in an unusually blunt statement called on short
notice.</p>
<p>“The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country,
regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,” said Scholz,
adding that Russia had violated that principle with its nearly
three-year invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France Inter radio,
“There is no question of the EU letting other nations in the world,
whoever they may be … attack its sovereign borders. We are a strong
continent. We need to strengthen ourselves more.”</p>
<p>Barrot said he did not believe the U.S. would invade the vast Arctic
island that has been part of Denmark for more than 600 years.</p>
<p>But he added, “We have entered an era that is seeing the return of
the law of the strongest. Should we be intimidated? Should we be
overcome with worry? Evidently, no,” he said.</p>
<p>“We need to wake up and reinforce ourselves militarily in competition
in a world where the law of the strongest prevails.”</p>
<p>Barrot said he believes the United States is “inherently not
imperialistic” and said he “did not believe” that it is changing.</p>

Department says it plans to release only part of Trump report for
now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that it will
release special counsel Jack Smith’s findings on Donald Trump’s efforts
to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election but will keep
under wraps for now the rest of the record focused on the
president-elect’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago
estate.</p>
<p>The revelation was made in a filing to a federal appeals court that
was considering a defense request to block the release of the two-volume
report while charges remain pending against two Trump co-defendants in

<p>The Justice Department said it would proceed with plans to release

asks Supreme Court to block sentencing in his hush money case in New
York</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President-elect Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court
to call off Friday’s sentencing in his hush money case in New York. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers turned to the nation’s highest court Wednesday after
New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Juan M. Merchan,
the judge who presided over Trump’s trial and conviction last May on 34
felony counts of falsifying business records. </p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys asked for an immediate stay of Friday’s sentencing
“to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the
Presidency and the operations of the federal government.” </p>
<p>The Supreme Court asked for a response from New York prosecutors by
Thursday. </p>
<p>Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or
probation. </p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys have pointed to the Supreme Court’s ruling giving
him broad immunity from criminal prosecution as they tried to have his
New York conviction tossed out. </p>
<p>While that opinion came in a different case, Trump’s lawyers say it
means some of the evidence used against him in his hush money trial
should have been shielded by presidential immunity. Merchan has
disagreed.</p>

of the clean energy subsidies</a> at the heart of both the bill and
United States alternative energy policy going back decades. The final
rules define what sources of energy are eligible for production and
investment tax credits (known as 45Y and 48E) by lumping together all
zero-emissions energy sources into one big group of winners and then
letting developers choose which credit they want to use.
</p>
<p>
The tax credits cover “wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic,
geothermal, nuclear,” according to a Treasury Department release, as
well as “certain waste energy recovery property” (heat from buildings),
and sets out a process for determining how combustion-dependent sources
such as biogas, biomass, and natural gas derived from sources like cow
manure could qualify. And unlike the tax credits they replaced, which
had fixed time periods they were in effect, the tech neutral credits
either begin phasing out in 2032 or when electricity sector greenhouse
gas emissions are a quarter of their 2022 level, whichever comes second.
“With Trump set to take office again in less than two weeks, these rules
will be cast into doubt almost as soon as they’re rolled out,”

Companies including Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, and Subaru are looking to

Mercedes is eyeing a similar initiative with Polestar. The EU’s new

reduce emissions by 15% compared to 2021, or face steep fines. Many
manufacturers called for the rules to be eased or delayed due to

forces struck Houthi weapons stores in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sanaa — The U.S. military said Wednesday its forces hit weapons
storage facilities used by Yemen’s Houthi rebels to attack American
warships and commercial vessels.</p>
<p>The operation involved “multiple precision strikes,” U.S. Central
Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement, adding “there were no injuries or
damage to US personnel or equipment,”</p>
<p>The statement did not specify the location of the storage
facilities.</p>
<p>“The strikes are part of CENTCOM’s effort to degrade Iranian-backed
[Houthi] attempts to threaten regional partners and military and
merchant vessels in the region,” it said.</p>
<p>The Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV said there were five raids in the
northwestern Amran province and two in Sanaa province, where the capital
Sanaa is located.</p>
<p>The Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014 from Yemen’s internationally
recognized government and control much of the war-torn country’s most
populated areas.</p>
<p>For more than a year they have been firing missiles and drones at
Israel and at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in what they say is
a show of solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in
the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Houthis’ attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have
destabilized a vital shipping lane, prompting strikes by the United
States and sometimes Britain that began in January 2024.</p>
<p>Most Houthi missiles and drones launched towards Israel have been
intercepted, but a missile wounded 16 people in Tel Aviv in December,
according to Israel’s military and emergency services.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
China’s greenhouse gas emissions were essentially flat this year — or
they recorded a tiny increase, according to
<a href="https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/chinas-climate-transition-outlook-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
recent report</a> from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air,
or CREA. A third of experts surveyed by the report believe that its coal
emissions have peaked. Has the world’s No. 1 emitter of carbon pollution
now turned a corner on climate change?
</p>
<p>
Lauri Myllyvirta is the co-founder and lead analyst at CREA, an
independent research organization focused on air pollution and
headquartered in Finland. Myllyvirta has worked on climate policy,
pollution, and energy issues in Asia for the past decade, and he lived
in Beijing from 2015 to 2019.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Lauri about
whether China’s emissions have peaked, why the country is still building
so much coal power (along with gobs of solar and wind), and the
energy-intensive shift that its economy has taken in the past five
years. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive
editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems
engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So there’s sort of two key variables
here. And we hit both those: the growth rate in new clean energy
supplies, particularly in the electricity sector, and then the pace of
demand growth. And this has been the story globally, the argument that
we actually haven’t really seen any energy transition, only energy
addition, right? We’re adding enough new clean energy, maybe, to meet
growth, but not actually to drive down emissions, which would require us
to exceed the growth rate and demand, right? So we can eat into the
market share of existing fossil generation.<br/> <br/> And that’s sort
of the fundamental equation in China as well, right? Is if demand is
growing rapidly, more rapidly than, clean electricity additions,
emissions go up. And if the opposite is true, emissions go down. There’s
also, it seems like, some evidence that the economy itself is slowing,
or at least going through a bit of a structural change, right? So still
growing, but not growing, perhaps, at the target rates that government
has set. I think the expectations for this year, if I’m not mistaken,
are under 5% growth, maybe 4.5% to 4.7% — so, you know, in U.S. terms,
that’s still quite rapid, but in Chinese terms, a bit slower than the
goal. And part of that is a slowdown in the construction industry — is
that right? — which is another major driver of emissions due to cement
consumption and steel consumption. <br/> <br/> <strong>Lauri
Myllyvirta:</strong> Yeah, so I’m a bit allergic to talking about the
economy as a whole — you know, “the economy” is slowing down, or “the
economy” is speeding up. Because the economy is, of course, made up of a
lot of different sectors, and in order to understand energy demand,
those sectors are not created equal. So if you have a 5% GDP growth that
comes from service industries, from consumer-facing industries, that can
mean much less than 5% growth in energy demand. And that’s what China
was seeing until the Covid period.<br/> <br/> China was actually making
a pretty big deal out of improving the energy, or reducing the
energy-intensity of the economy. And that’s what stopped in 2020. So
since 2020, there has been essentially no reduction in the energy
intensity, energy consumption, and GDP has grown at the same rate. And
when you consider the fact that there is a lot of technical improvement
still going on, different processes are getting more energy efficient,
then that means that the structure of the economy has, in fact, gotten
<em><em>more</em></em> energy-intensive. And that’s the key concern. The
less than 5% growth now is driving faster growth in total energy demand
than the 6%, even 7% growth was during the previous decade.

flee, homes destroyed as Los Angeles wildfires burn out of control</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — California firefighters battled wind-whipped wildfires
that tore across the Los Angeles area, destroying homes, clogging
roadways as tens of thousands fled and straining resources as officials
prepared for the situation to worsen early Wednesday.</p>
<p>The flames from a fire that broke out Tuesday evening near a nature
preserve in the inland foothills northeast of LA spread so rapidly that
staff at a senior living center had to push dozens of residents in
wheelchairs and hospital beds down the street to a parking lot. The
residents waited there in their bedclothes as embers fell around them
until ambulances, buses and even construction vans arrived to take them
to safety.</p>
<p>Another blaze that started hours earlier ripped through the city’s
Pacific Palisades neighborhood, a hillside area along the coast dotted
with celebrity residences and memorialized by the Beach Boys in their
1960s hit “Surfin’ USA.” In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways
became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and
fled on foot, some toting suitcases.</p>
<p>The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from
getting through and bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars
to the side and create a path. Video along the Pacific Coast Highway
showed widespread destruction of homes and businesses along the famed
roadway.</p>
<p>Pacific Palisades resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and
out of her neighborhood was blocked. Ash fell all around them while
fires burned on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>“We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road
to the other side of the road,” Trainor said. “People were getting out
of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and
screaming.”</p>
<p>A third wildfire started around 10:30 p.m. local time and quickly
prompted evacuations in Sylmar, a San Fernando Valley community that is
the northernmost neighborhood in Los Angeles. The causes of all three
fires were under investigation.</p>
<p>Flames were being pushed by Santa Ana winds topping 97 kph in some
places. The winds were expected to increase overnight, producing
isolated gusts that could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills —
including in areas that haven’t seen substantial rain in months.</p>
<p>The situation prompted the Los Angeles Fire Department to take the
rare step of putting out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help. It
was too windy for firefighting aircraft to fly, further hampering the
fight.</p>
<p>The erratic weather caused President Joe Biden to cancel plans to
travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the
establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in
Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on
the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant
to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost.</p>
<p>Officials didn’t give an estimate of structures damaged or destroyed
in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents
were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under
threat. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the scene and said many homes had
burned.</p>
<p>By evening the flames had spread into neighboring Malibu and several
people there were being treated for burn injuries and a firefighter had
a serious head injury and was taken to a hospital, according to Los
Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott.</p>
<p>Things were expected to worsen overnight.</p>
<p>“By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” Newsom
warned residents, saying the worst of the winds were expected to
continue through the night. He declared a state of emergency.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday evening, nearly 167,000 people were without power in
Los Angeles county, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us,
due to the strong winds.</p>
<p>Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have
contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California,
where there’s been very little rain so far this season. Southern
California hasn’t seen more than 0.25 centimeters of rain since early
May.</p>
<p>The Pacific Palisades fire started in the late morning local time and
quickly consumed about 11.6 square kilometers and sent up a dramatic
plume of smoke visible across Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 32 kilometers west of
downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along
winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches
down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to
pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the
fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife’s car as
she tried to evacuate.</p>
<p>“She vacated her car and left it running,” Adams said. She and many
other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe.</p>
<p>Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years
he’s lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as
homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs “like small
explosions,” which he said he believes were the transformers
exploding.</p>
<p>“It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the
Palisades. One home’s safe, the other one’s up in flames,” Adams
said.</p>
<p>Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and
past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames
billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes.</p>
<p>“Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,” Woods said in
the short video on X.</p>
<p>Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were
burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe,
Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum
located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus
of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of
ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High
School.</p>
<p>Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy
weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily
relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades
area.</p>

Maduro says 2 US citizens arrested, branded as ‘mercenaries’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Two U.S. citizens have been arrested in
Venezuela, part of a group of seven whom President Nicolas Maduro on
Tuesday branded as “mercenaries” in the latest roundup ahead of the
embattled leader’s expected inauguration to a new term later this
week.</p>
<p>Maduro said the detained U.S. citizens were “very high level” but did
not provide further details or evidence of the arrests.</p>
<p>“Just today we’ve captured seven foreign mercenaries, including two
important mercenaries from the United States,” said Maduro, who is set
to take office for a third term on Friday following last July’s
contested election that the opposition says it won in a landslide.</p>
<p>Maduro said the group of detainees includes two Colombians who he
said were captured in unspecified parts of Venezuela, as well as three
others who came from the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Neither the U.S. Department of State nor Colombia’s Foreign Ministry
responded immediately to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Venezuelan rights groups have warned of a revolving door of
prisoners, with fresh detentions coming in even as older prisoners are
released, including arrests of foreign nationals.</p>
<p>In late 2023, Venezuela’s government released dozens of prisoners
including 10 Americans after months of negotiations between Caracas and
Washington, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro, Colombian
businessman Alex Saab.</p>
<p>In remarks delivered from the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro
on Tuesday claimed that his government’s security forces have captured
what he called 125 foreign mercenaries from 25 different countries who
he said had entered the South American nation “to practice terrorism
against the Venezuelan people.”</p>
<p>The remarks come as opposition presidential candidate Edmundo
Gonzalez is touring the region in a bid to grow his international
support. Gonzalez has been declared president-elect by several
governments, including the United States.</p>
<p>On Monday, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said Gonzalez was the
“true winner” of the July 28 vote.</p>
<p>While the government-aligned electoral authority and Venezuela’s top
court have decreed that Maduro won the election, the government has not
released ballot-box level results to back up the claim.</p>
<p>The opposition, however, has published thousands of scanned copies of
voting machine receipts its observers gathered days after the vote,
accounting for over 80% of votes cast and showing a lopsided Gonzalez
victory.</p>

administration asks court to block plea deal for alleged 9/11
mastermind</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Tuesday asked a federal
appeals court to block a plea agreement for accused 9/11 mastermind
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants that would spare them the
risk of the death penalty. </p>
<p>The Justice Department argued in a brief filed with a federal appeals
court in the District of Columbia that the government would be
irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the
government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the
opportunity to “seek capital punishment against three men charged with a
heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people
and shocked the nation and the world.” </p>
<p>The military judge at Guantanamo Bay and a military appeals panel
rejected Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s effort to throw out the plea
agreement, saying he had no power to do so after the senior Pentagon
official for Guantanamo approved it in July. </p>
<p>Mohammed was due to enter his guilty plea on Friday and his two
co-defendants next week. </p>
<p>The Justice Department brief said the defendants, by contrast, would
not be harmed by a short delay, given that the prosecution has been
ongoing since 2012 and the plea agreements would likely result in them
serving long prison sentences, potentially for the rest of their
lives. </p>
<p>“A short delay to allow this Court to weigh the merits of the
government’s request in this momentous case will not materially harm the
respondents,” the government argued.</p>

ordered to flee Los Angeles-area wildfire; 13,000 structures
threatened</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Firefighters scrambled to corral a fast-moving wildfire
in the Los Angeles hillsides dotted with celebrity homes as a fierce
windstorm hit Southern California on Tuesday. The blaze could be seen
for miles as scores of residents abandoned their cars and fled on foot
to safety as roads became blocked. </p>
<p>About 30,000 residents are under evacuation orders and more than
13,000 structures are under threat, said Kristin Crowley, fire chief of
the Los Angeles. Fire Department. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom said he saw “many structures already
destroyed.” Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged
or destroyed in the blaze. </p>
<p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known, and no injuries had
been reported, officials said at a news conference Tuesday
afternoon. </p>
<p>Newsom warned residents across Southern California not to assume they
are out of danger, saying the worst of the winds are expected between 10
p.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday. </p>
<p>Forecasters predicted the windstorm would last for days, producing
isolated gusts that could top 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles per
hour) in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven’t seen
substantial rain in months. The National Weather service said it could
be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in more than a decade across Los
Angeles and Ventura counties. </p>
<p>Roughly half a million utility customers were at risk of their power
being shut off to reduce the risk of the equipment sparking blazes. </p>
<p>In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, a fire
swiftly consumed about 5 square kilometers (2 square miles) of land,
sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents
in Venice Beach, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, reported seeing the
flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. </p>
<p>Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were
closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. Other
roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to
escape the danger and waited to be picked up. </p>
<p>Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her
neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while
fires burned on both sides of the road. </p>
<p>“We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road
to the other side of the road,” Trainor said. “People were getting out
of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and
screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an
hour.” </p>
<p>An Associated Press journalist saw the roof and chimney of one home
in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The
neighborhood that borders Malibu about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of
downtown Los Angeles includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes
along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and
stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p>Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he had never seen a fire
this low into the neighborhood in the 56 years he’s lived there. </p>
<p>“It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the
Palisades,” he said. “One home’s safe, the other one’s up in
flames.” </p>
<p>Adams watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started
burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs “like small explosions,”
which he said he believes were the transformers exploding on the
electric poles. </p>
<p>Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and
past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames
billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. </p>
<p>Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged
people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could
be moved to make way for fire trucks. </p>
<p>“This is not a parking lot,” Guttenberg told KTLA. “I have friends up
there and they can’t evacuate. … I’m walking up there as far as I can
moving cars.” </p>
<p>The winds will act as an “atmospheric blow-dryer” for vegetation,
bringing a long period of fire risk, said Daniel Swain, a climate
scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles and the
National Center for Atmospheric Research. </p>
<p>“We really haven’t seen a season as dry as this one follow a season
as wet as the previous one,” Swain said Monday. </p>
<p>Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have
contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California,
where there’s been very little rain so far this season.</p>

id="peter-yarrow-of-folk-music-trio-peter-paul-and-mary-dies-at-86">Peter
Yarrow of folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as
one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned
harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of
civil rights and against war, has died. He was 86.</p>
<p>Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group’s most enduring song, “Puff the
Magic Dragon,” died Tuesday in New York, publicist Ken Sunshine said.
Yarrow had bladder cancer for the past four years.</p>
<p>“Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his
magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist,
but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous,
creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,” his
daughter Bethany said in a statement.</p>
<p>During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel
Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles and
two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.</p>
<p>They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his
songs, “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” and “Blowin’ in the Wind,”
into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance
in folk music. They performed “Blowin’ in the Wind” at the 1963 March on
Washington at which the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
famous “I Have a Dream” speech.</p>
<p>After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited
in 1978 for a “Survival Sunday,” an anti-nuclear-power concert that
Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until
Travers’ death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued
to perform both separately and together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an
upper-middle-class family he said placed high value on art and
scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to
guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk music icons as Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New
York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until
connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in
psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when
he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his
senior year.</p>
<p>Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman,
who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the
time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston
Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad
“Tom Dooley.”</p>
<p>But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who
could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For
the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic
he’d seen named Noel Stookey.</p>
<p>Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group,
happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and
recorded with Pete Seeger and others.</p>
<p>After months of rehearsal, the three became an overnight sensation
when their first album, 1962’s eponymous “Peter, Paul and Mary,” reached
No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, “In the Wind,” reached No. 4
and their third, “Moving,” put them back at No. 1.</p>
<p>From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and
injustice in songs like Seeger’s “If I Had a Hammer” and “Where Have all
the Flowers Gone,” Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “When the Ship
Comes In,” and Yarrow’s own “Day is Done.”</p>
<p>They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on “Puff
the Magic Dragon,” which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years
with college friend Leonard Lipton.</p>
<p>It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on
countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he
outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff
behind. As Yarrow explains: “A dragon lives forever, but not so little
boys.”</p>
<p>After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver’s
“Leaving on a Jet Plane,” the trio split up the following year to pursue
solo careers.</p>
<p>That same year Yarrow had pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties
with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older
sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered
the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving
three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981.
Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.</p>
<p>Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs,
including the 1976 hit “Torn Between Two Lovers” for Mary MacGregor. He
received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film “Puff the
Magic Dragon.”</p>
<p>Later songs include the civil rights anthem “No Easy Walk to
Freedom,” co-written with Margery Tabankin, and “Light One Candle,”
calling for peace in Lebanon.</p>
<p>In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by a son,
Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.</p>

id="meta-to-offer-wider-range-of-speech-on-platforms-ceo-says-1">Meta to
offer wider range of speech on platforms, CEO says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that
there would be a wider range of speech on Facebook and other Meta
platforms.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get back to our roots around free expression on
Facebook and Instagram,” he said.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key changes:</p>
<p>Gone will be third-party fact-checkers eyeing Facebook posts for
violations in the United States. Instead, Facebook will rely on
“community notes,” a system used on X (formerly Twitter) that allows
community members to flag posts and vote on the legitimacy of them.</p>
<p>Restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity will
be lifted.</p>
<p>“What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly
been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different
ideas, and it’s gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can
share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms,” Zuckerberg
said.</p>
<p>Civic and political content, which the company stopped presenting to
users in recent years, will be recommended again on Facebook, Instagram
and Threads.</p>
<p>And the firm’s trust and safety and content moderation teams will
move from California, considered a liberal state, to Texas, considered a
conservative-leaning state. The move “will help us build trust to do
this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our
teams,” he said.</p>
<p>Preparing for Trump</p>
<p>Zuckerberg’s announcement comes as Meta and other technology
companies prepare for major policy and regulatory changes with the
return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House this
month.</p>
<p>In his attacks on the dominant technology companies, known
collectively as Big Tech, Trump has been particularly critical of Meta,
which suspended his account in 2021 after the January 6, 2021, riot at
the U.S. Capitol Building. His accounts were restored in 2023.</p>
<p>At a press conference Tuesday, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg’s
announcement.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I think they’ve come a long way,” he said. He said the
firm was “probably” responding to his threats that he had planned to do
something about Big Tech and censorship.</p>
<p>Reactions mixed</p>
<p>“This is cool,” Elon Musk said of the Meta announcement. Musk bought
Twitter in 2023 and renamed it X and is a close adviser to Trump.</p>
<p>X Corp. CEO Linda Yaccarino said on X that “fact-checking and
moderation doesn’t belong in the hands of a few select gatekeepers who
can easily inject their bias into decisions. It’s a democratic process
that belongs in the hands of many.”</p>
<p>Also on X, Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised Zuckerberg’s
announcement as a “huge step in the right direction.”</p>
<p>“Social media, AI, and other technology companies must resist
governments’ censorship pressure and instead work to ensure the open
expression of ideas on their platforms,” Jordan posted. “We hope that
other Big Tech companies, including Google, follow the lead of X and
Meta in upholding freedom of speech online.”</p>
<p>Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor of human-centered
design and engineering, said on the social media site Bluesky that
Meta’s decision will hamper people’s ability to find out the truth.</p>
<p>“One remaining concern for me is that even people who WANT to find
accurate information are going to be challenged to do it, because we’re
going to lose the groups that do this fact-checking work — unless
non-profits step in to fill what is going to be a huge funding gap,” she
posted.</p>
<p>Yoel Roth, a former head of Twitter’s trust and safety department,
said on Bluesky that he was “genuinely baffled by the unempirical
assertion that Community Notes ‘works.’ Does it? How do Meta know? The
best available research is pretty mixed on this point.”</p>
<p>‘Too many mistakes’</p>
<p>In his statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg described a complex system of
filters the company created to identify “legitimately bad stuff out
there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation.”</p>
<p>But the systems, while well-intentioned, made mistakes, resulting in
wrongly censored postings, he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much
censorship,” he said.</p>
<p>The company will be “dialing back” content filters that scanned for
policy violations with the goal to “dramatically reduce the amount of
censorship on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, said in a separate
statement that “too much harmless content gets censored, too many people
find themselves wrongly locked up in ‘Facebook jail,’ and we are often
too slow to respond when they do.”</p>
<p>Biden ‘repeatedly pressured’</p>
<p>Without offering examples, Zuckerberg said in August that the U.S.
government under the Biden administration pushed for censorship. In
August, Zuckerberg said in a letter to Jordan that Biden officials
“repeatedly pressured” Facebook to take down some COVID-19 content,
including humor and satire.</p>
<p>“By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened
other governments to go even further,” Zuckerberg said Tuesday. “But now
we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I’m excited to
take it.”</p>

lawmakers honor former President Jimmy Carter in Capitol Rotunda</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers honored Jimmy Carter on Tuesday, as the
body of the nation’s 39th president arrived to lie in state in the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>“Today, we gather to celebrate the life of a man whose works will
echo for generations to come,” Vice President Kamala Harris said to the
distinguished guests and members of Carter’s family assembled in the
U.S. Capitol Rotunda.</p>
<p>Carter, a one-term Democratic president and Nobel Peace Prize winner,
will lie in state in Washington for two days, allowing the American
public to pay its final respects.</p>
<p>Harris recognized Carter’s role in brokering the Camp David Accords,
instituting ethics reforms and founding the departments of Education and
Energy.</p>
<p>Congressional leadership also recalled his presidency, which occurred
during a tumultuous time in American history.</p>
<p>“President Carter’s life, his selfless service, his fight against
cancer and his lasting contributions to his fellow man are all truly
remarkable,” Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. “President Carter
was willing to roll up his own sleeves to serve and get the job
done.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier
Tuesday that Carter was “one of the most decent men ever to hold the
office of president. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word:
kind, honorable, intelligent, humble, deeply patriotic. These are the
virtues he brought to the Oval Office, in an era where trust in
government was arguably at a low in the 20th century.”</p>
<p>Carter’s presidency began while the nation was still recovering from
the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, the latter
of which resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the
decline of American trust in public institutions.</p>
<p>Carter’s term (1977-1981) was marked by economic inflation and crises
in Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America.
I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you could agree with his
patriotism,” Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA.</p>
<p>Carter was the longest-living U.S. president, dying at 100 years old.
His post-White House career traveling the world engaged in diplomacy and
charity work redefined how American presidents lived after their terms
in office.</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter had a presidency at a time of tumult — the Iranian
hostage crisis, inflation. Frankly, not dissimilar to Joe Biden’s
presidency in some respects,” Republican Representative Mike Lawler told
VOA. “But I think Jimmy Carter has always been viewed by the American
people as a decent man, someone who really cared deeply about this
country and its people and certainly in his post-presidential life was
very focused on what he could do to help the American people and his
work with Habitat for Humanity.”</p>
<p>According to the Architect of the Capitol, only 46 individuals have
lain in state or in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda since the nation’s
founding. Carter’s remains will return to his home state of Georgia on
Thursday for a private family burial.</p>

who exploded Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas used generative AI, police
say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — The highly decorated soldier who exploded a Tesla
Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas used generative AI
including ChatGPT to help plan the attack, Las Vegas police said
Tuesday.</p>
<p>A laptop, cellphone and watch are still under review nearly a week
after 37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger fatally shot himself just before
the truck blew up.</p>
<p>An investigation of Livelsberger’s searches through ChatGPT indicate
he was looking for information on explosive targets, the speed at which
certain rounds of ammunition would travel and whether fireworks were
legal in Arizona.</p>
<p>Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Department, called the use of generative AI a “game-changer” and said
the department was sharing information with other law enforcement
agencies.</p>
<p>“This is the first incident that I’m aware of on U.S. soil where
ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,” he
said. “It’s a concerning moment.”</p>
<p>During a roughly half-hour-long news conference, Las Vegas police and
federal law enforcement officials unveiled new details about the New
Year’s Day explosion.</p>
<p>Among the details law enforcement disclosed: Livelsberger stopped
during the drive to Las Vegas to pour racing-grade fuel into the
Cybertruck, which then dripped the substance. The vehicle was loaded
with 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of pyrotechnic material, and officials are
still uncertain exactly what detonated the explosion but said it could
have been the flash from the firearm that Livelsberger used to fatally
shoot himself.</p>
<p>Livelsberger, an Army Green Beret who deployed twice to Afghanistan
and lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, left notes saying the explosion
was a stunt meant to be a “wake up call” for the nation’s troubles,
officials said last week.</p>
<p>He left cellphone notes saying he needed to “cleanse” his mind “of
the brothers I’ve lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I
took.”</p>
<p>The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no
damage to the Trump International Hotel. Authorities said that
Livelsberger acted alone.</p>
<p>Livelsberger’s letters touched on political grievances, societal
problems and domestic and international issues, including the war in
Ukraine. He wrote that the U.S. was “terminally ill and headed toward
collapse.”</p>
<p>Investigators had been trying to determine if Livelsberger wanted to
make a political point, given the Tesla and the hotel bearing the
president-elect’s name.</p>
<p>Livelsberger harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald
Trump, law enforcement officials said. In one of the notes he left, he
said the country needed to “rally around” Trump and Tesla CEO Elon
Musk.</p>

Biden Administration Is Pitching Trump on Its Final Clean Energy Tax
Credits</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
The Biden administration rolled out the pièce de résistance of its
Inflation Reduction Act tax credits on Tuesday, publishing the final
rules for its
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-00196/clean-electricity-production-credit-and-clean-electricity-investment-credit" target="_blank">overhaul
of the clean energy subsidies</a> at the heart of both the bill and
United States alternative energy policy going back decades.
</p>
<p>
The final rules, which largely
<a href="https://www.novoco.com/public-media/documents/irs-federal-register-2024-11719-05292024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>match
proposed ones published</u></a> in May, define what sources of energy
are eligible for production and investment tax credits, known as 45Y and
48E — not, as before, by writing a list of qualifying energy
technologies specified by Congress, but rather by lumping together all
zero-emissions energy sources into one big group of winners and then
letting developers choose which credit they want to use.
</p>
<p>
The tax credits cover “wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic,
geothermal, nuclear,” according to a Treasury Department release, as
well as “certain waste energy recovery property” (heat from buildings),
and sets out a process for determining how combustion-dependent sources
such as biogas, biomass, and natural gas derived from sources like cow
manure could qualify. And unlike the tax credits they replaced, which
had fixed time periods they were in effect, the tech neutral credits
either begin phasing out in 2032 or when electricity sector greenhouse
gas emissions are a quarter of their 2022 level, whichever comes second.
</p>
<p>
It’s not lost on anyone at Treasury or in the Biden administration that
with Trump set to take office again in less than two weeks, these rules
will be cast into doubt almost as soon as they’re rolled out. The
administration is thus making an effort to cast the tax credits as a
money-saving proposition for energy consumers — especially households —
and a spur for investment across the country.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, the power market forecasting firm Aurora Energy Research
<a href="https://auroraer.com/media/reform-to-clean-energy-tax-credits/" target="_blank">released
an analysis</a> finding that scrapping certain IRA provisions, including
the technology neutral credits, would “result in $336 billion less
investment, 237 gigawatts less clean energy generation capacity, and at
least 97,000 net fewer American jobs by 2040.” But what will likely
catch the attention of policymakers is its conclusion that “consumers
could see monthly household energy bills rise by an average of 10%, with
states like Texas facing an increase of up to 22% compared to a scenario
with continued tax credit support.”
</p>
<p>
Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo emphasized America’s
energy competitiveness on a call with reporters Monday about the final
rules. “The tech neutral ITC and PTC” — that is, investment tax credit
and production tax credit — “will drive innovation by creating
conditions for new zero-emission technologies to develop over time,”
Adeyemo said. These policies together constitute an “energy moon shot,”
he added, “because they reward innovation and innovative technologies
developed in America to drive down energy costs while creating good
paying jobs.”
</p>
<p>
Whether these arguments will convince to the Trump administration we
will soon find out. While some Republicans have lined up in support of
Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that have led to jobs in their
districts, the incoming economic braintrust has taken a dim view of the
bill, and Congress will be on the hunt for any spare dollar they can
find to offset the costs of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Trump’s incoming chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Stephen
Miran, has described the IRA, along with
<a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/brittle-versus-robust-reindustrialization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other
Biden industrial policy initiatives</u></a> like the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS Act, as “tilting at windmills to boost
politically favored sectors that can survive only with permanent
subsidization.” Trump’s designee for the Secretary of Treasury, Scott
Bessent,
<a href="https://manhattan.institute/article/the-fallacy-of-bidenomics-a-return-to-central-planning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
said the IRA</u></a> “will severely distort the supply side of the
economy by crowding out investment in more productive sectors.”
</p>
<p>
While specific technologies have long been popular with specific
Republicans — see “wind” and “Chuck Grassley” — lumping together the
technologies along with a variety of bonuses designed to achieve
Democratic policy goals around serving specific communities or workers
could put the entire edifice of clean energy support at risk.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks ago, the Treasury released final rules governing the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/final-investment-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>old
tax credits</u></a>, which were also updated under the IRA. Projects
would qualify for 48E and 45Y for projects placed into service this year
or later, while those that began construction before the end of the year
could still qualify for the old credits. Many analysts think that even
if the IRA were adjusted or repealed, an administrative process could be
put in place to protect credits for projects that have already started.
</p>
<p>
In any case, in just 13 days, we’ll start getting answers, or at least
putting the theories to the test.

<p>
President-elect Donald Trump’s first press conference after yesterday’s
certification of his election win (four years to the day since the
January 6, 2021 Capitol riots) was never going to be a normal one. And
so it proved that Trump’s wide-ranging comments at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday
hit some familiar
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>climate
and energy falsehoods</u></a> alongside some eyebrow-raising new ones,
the largest-scale of which was probably his threat to reverse President
Biden’s newly announced
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-offshore-drilling-ban" target="_self"><u>drilling
ban</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Biden signaled his move to permanently ban new offshore oil and gas
drilling yesterday along most U.S. coastlines. The 625 million acres
covered by the ban would include the entire East Coast, the eastern Gulf
of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and
California, and parts of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. “I will
reverse it immediately,” Trump remarked of the ban. “It’ll be done
immediately. And we will drill, baby, drill.” He also added that “we’re
going to be drilling a lot of other locations,” and used the opportunity
to call the energy transition “the green new scam,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-vance-green-new-deal" target="_self"><u>an
old favorite of his</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
While Trump’s threats were alarming, they’re also most likely empty. The
drilling ban would be considered permanent under the law, and Trump
would not be able to simply reverse it without the approval of Congress.
</p>
<p>
In addition to his comments on drilling, Trump briefly criticized
Biden’s “love” of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>electric
cars</u></a>, and once again claimed that his administration was “going
to be ending the electric car mandate quickly, by the way,” the lack of
such a mandate notwithstanding. “This guy loves electric, and we don’t
have enough electricity,” he said. “And then we have AI where we need
more.” Trump isn’t necessarily wrong about “more” AI energy demand, and
in case he’s reading this, we have a bit of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/data-center-solar-microgrids" target="_self"><u>recommended</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>background</u></a>
for him on the topic.
</p>
<p>
Lest you think that Trump forgot his most beloved renewable energy
talking point, he reiterated his hatred for wind power by adding, “We’re
going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built.” He
noted “they don’t work without subsidy. … You don’t want energy that
needs subsidy,” and repeated his
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check" target="_self"><u>blatantly
false and conspiracy-driven claim</u></a> that “the windmills are
driving the whales crazy,” noting that offshore wind caused the beaching
of “two whales” in a “17-year period.” As a reminder, Lauren Gaches, the
director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, previously told Heatmap that
“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind
site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of
whales.” (Also worth noting: The oil and gas industry has long benefited
from
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>generous
tax subsidies</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Trump also went on to shout out … gas heaters? He claimed that Biden
“wants everybody to have an electric heater instead of a gas heater,”
adding that gas heaters are “much less expensive,” “work much better,”
and don’t make you “scratch and itch.” It’s not clear whether was
talking about heat pumps or electric resistance heaters, both of which
are powered by electricity. But gas furnace sales have been outpaced by
heat pumps for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/heat-pumps-beat-gas-furnaces-2023" target="_self"><u>several
years running</u></a>, with no widespread itch issues we can find. Trump
also put low-flow showerheads on blast: “It’s called rain, comes down
from heaven. And they want to do, no water comes out of the shower.”
This hasn’t been true of low-flow shower heads for some time now, as my
colleague Jeva Lange
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-efficiency-fact-check" target="_self"><u>reported
last summer</u></a>, which are “specifically designed to ‘push out water
that feels like a higher pressure even with a lower flow rate.’”
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, there is no time like the present to peruse Jeva’s
fact-check of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>Trump’s
climate and energy claims</u></a>. We’re going to be hearing a lot more
of them in the coming years.

id="trump-all-hell-will-break-out-if-hamas-hostages-not-returned">Trump:
‘All hell will break out’ if Hamas hostages not returned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday held an omnibus
press conference at his Florida estate, where he explained his stances
on key foreign policy issues as he prepares to take office in two weeks.
 </p>
<p>He forcefully called for the release of hostages seized in Israel
more than a year ago by the militant group Hamas, saying six times that
“all hell will break loose” otherwise.    </p>
<p>Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist organization,
dug in on its top demand in ongoing negotiations that Israel ends its
assault and withdraw from Gaza. At a news conference in Algiers, Hamas
official Osama Hamdan blamed Israel for stymieing a deal.  </p>
<p>When asked to respond to Trump’s comments, Hamdan replied, “I think
the U.S. president must make more disciplined and diplomatic
statements.” </p>
<p>The Palestinian group’s stunning terror attack on civilians in Israel
sparked a brutal conflict that has since inflamed the region and killed
tens of thousands of civilians.    </p>
<p>Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had moments before joined
the president-elect at the podium to brief reporters on his recent
high-level talks in the region, saying his team is “on the verge” of a
deal and that he would travel back in coming days.    </p>
<p>“I don’t want to hurt your negotiation,” Trump told Witkoff, “but if
they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out
in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not
be good, frankly, for anyone.”    </p>
<p>On Ukraine, he expressed interest in meeting with Russian President
Vladimir Putin and repeated his vow to get the conflict in Ukraine
“straightened out.” Trump has not explained how he would do this.
   </p>
<p>When asked about a key demand in Ukraine’s peace plan — that it be
allowed to join NATO — Trump said, “My view is that it was always
understood” that Ukraine would not be admitted to the security alliance.
   </p>
<p>He repeated his tariff threats against Canada and Mexico, his line
that Canada should be a U.S. state, and he floated a name change,
saying: “We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to
the Gulf of America.”    </p>
<p>Thessalia Merivaki, an associate teaching professor at Georgetown
University, said Trump often uses bluster as a strategy.    </p>
<p>“So, Trump has a record of just floating controversial ideas and
positions to attract attention and generate interest and media
coverage,” she said.    </p>
<p>Foreign policy  </p>
<p>Trump has not said how the U.S. will acquire control of Greenland,
the large North American island that is an autonomous territory of
Denmark. On Tuesday, he repeated his stance that “we need them for
economic security.”  </p>
<p>When asked directly if he would commit to not use military or
economic coercion to back his increasingly voluble desire for control of
Greenland and also the Panama Canal, Trump replied, “I can’t assure you
on either of those two.”    </p>
<p>Trump has accused Panama of violating the treaty under which the U.S.
ceded control of the famous canal more than four decades ago under
former President Jimmy Carter.  </p>
<p>“Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake,” Trump
said. “Giving that away was a horrible thing, and I believe that’s why
Jimmy Carter lost the election.”    </p>
<p>Trump added that he liked Carter “as a man.” He is expected to attend
Carter’s national funeral Thursday in Washington. President Joe Biden
will deliver the eulogy.  </p>
<p>First day and beyond  </p>
<p>Trump also said he would be “making major pardons” on his first day
in office, when asked about his previous vow to issue clemency to some
of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in connection to the
riot on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.    </p>
<p>He also repeated past commitments to loosen what he called the
“quagmire” of U.S. environmental regulations and smooth the path for
billionaire investors.  </p>
<p>He described his re-election victory as a “landslide” for winning the
Electoral College and the popular vote, although official results show
he did not win the majority of the ballots, as third-party candidates
shaved off votes. He promised to have future election results counted
earlier on election night.  </p>
<p>He repeated his vow to “drill, baby, drill” on his first day in
office by reversing Biden’s recent orders seeking to protect against
offshore drilling.    </p>
<p>He accused Biden of botching foreign policy, saying, “Now, I’m going
into a world that’s burning.”</p>
<p>Trump will assume office on January 20.  </p>

special prosecutor temporarily blocked from releasing report on
probe</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack
Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into President-elect
Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents and attempts to
overturn the 2020 presidential election, a court order showed on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who presided over the
now-dismissed case accusing Trump of illegally holding onto classified
documents, directed the Justice Department not to release the report
until a federal appeals court rules on a request from Trump’s two former
co-defendants in the case.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who
were charged with obstructing the documents investigation, moved late
Monday to block release of the report.</p>
<p>Nauta and De Oliveira argued the report would improperly interfere in
their case, which remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Smith led both the classified documents case against Trump and a
second prosecution accusing Trump of attempting to overturn his defeat
in the 2020 election. Both cases have since been dropped.</p>
<p>Trump, who dismissed the federal probe and the two other criminal
investigations he faced as a politically motivated attempt to block him
from returning to power, said he welcomed the news.</p>
<p>“It was a fake case against a political opponent,” Trump told
reporters at his Florida resort on Tuesday. “If they’re not allowed to
issue the report, that’s the way it should be … that’s great news.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment on the
order.</p>
<p>Justice Department regulations require Smith, who plans to wrap up
his probe before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, to submit a final
report to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland has previously
pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his
tenure.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in a court filing earlier on Tuesday that Garland,
who appointed Smith, had not yet decided how to handle the portion of
the report that relates to the classified documents case.  </p>
<p>Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case against Trump and his
two co-defendants in July 2024 after ruling that Smith was improperly
appointed. Prosecutors are appealing the ruling as it pertains to Nauta
and De Oliveira.</p>

id="president-elect-donald-trump-tries-again-to-get-fridays-hush-money-sentencing-called-off">President-elect
Donald Trump tries again to get Friday’s hush money sentencing called
off</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump tried again Tuesday to delay
this week’s sentencing in his hush money case, asking a New York appeals
court to intervene as he fights to avoid the finality of his conviction
before he returns to the White House. </p>
<p>Trump turned to the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court a
day after the trial judge, Judge Juan M. Merchan, rebuffed his bid to
indefinitely postpone sentencing and ordered it to go ahead as scheduled
on Friday. </p>
<p>Trump is seeking an emergency order that would spare him from being
sentenced while he appeals Merchan’s decision last week to uphold the
historic verdict. Oral arguments were expected before a single judge
later Tuesday, with a decision likely soon thereafter. </p>
<p>A quick decision is necessary “to prevent ongoing violations” of
Trump’s constitutional rights “and a threatened disruption” of the
presidential transition process, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a
filing with the Appellate Division. </p>
<p>Trump, less than two weeks from his inauguration, is poised to be the
first president to take office convicted of crimes. If his sentencing
doesn’t happen before his second term starts Jan. 20, presidential
immunity could put it on hold until he leaves office. </p>
<p>Merchan has signaled that he is not likely to punish Trump for his
conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and will
accommodate the transition by allowing him to appear at sentencing by
video, rather than in person at a Manhattan courthouse. </p>
<p>Still, the Republican and his lawyers contend that his sentencing
should not go forward because the conviction and indictment should be
dismissed. They have previously suggested taking the case all the way to
the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Merchan last Friday denied Trump’s request to throw out his
conviction and dismiss the case because of his impending return to the
White House, ruling that Trump’s current status as president-elect does
not afford him the same immunity from criminal proceedings as a sitting
president. </p>
<p>Merchan wrote that the interests of justice would only be served by
“bringing finality to this matter” through sentencing. He said giving
Trump what’s known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case
without jail time, a fine or probation — “appears to be the most viable
solution.” </p>
<p>In his filing Tuesday, Blanche argued that Merchan’s interpretation
of presidential immunity was wrong and that it should extend to a
president-elect during “the complex, sensitive process of presidential
transition.” </p>
<p>“It is unconstitutional to conduct a criminal sentencing of the
president-elect during a presidential transition, and doing so threatens
to disrupt that transition and undermine the incoming president’s
ability to effectively wield the executive power of the United States,”
Blanche wrote. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers are also challenging the judge’s prior decision
rejecting Trump’s argument that the case should be thrown out because of
the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last July that gave presidents broad
immunity from prosecution. </p>
<p>Manhattan prosecutors have pushed for sentencing to proceed as
scheduled, “given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and
the finality of criminal proceedings.” </p>
<p>Trump was convicted last May on charges involving an alleged scheme
to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last
weeks of Trump’s 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she’d
had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that
he did nothing wrong. </p>
<p>The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his
then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels.
The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine
or probation to up to four years in prison. </p>
<p>Trump’s sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed
twice at the defense’s request. After Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan
delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh
in on the future of the case.</p>

<h2 id="us-determines-sudans-rsf-committed-genocide-sanctions-leader">US
determines Sudan’s RSF committed genocide, sanctions leader</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States determined on Tuesday that members of
Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces and allied militias committed genocide in
Sudan and it imposed sanctions on the group’s leader over a conflict
that has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from
their homes.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the RSF
and aligned militias had continued to direct attacks against civilians,
adding that they had systematically murdered men and boys on an ethnic
basis and had deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic
groups for rape and other forms of sexual violence.</p>
<p>The militias have also targeted fleeing civilians and murdered
innocent people escaping conflict, Blinken said.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to holding accountable those
responsible for these atrocities,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Washington announced sanctions on the leader of the RSF, Mohamed
Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti, barring him from traveling
to the United States and freezing any U.S. assets he might hold.</p>
<p>“For nearly two years, Hemedti’s RSF has engaged in a brutal armed
conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces for control of Sudan, killing
tens of thousands, displacing 12 million Sudanese, and triggering
widespread starvation,” the Treasury Department said in a separate
statement.</p>
<p>Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been
locked in conflict for more than 18 months, creating a humanitarian
crisis in which U.N. agencies have struggled to deliver relief.</p>
<p>The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the
Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to
civilian rule.</p>

id="trump-jr.-arrives-in-greenland-after-his-father-said-us-should-own-it">Trump
Jr. arrives in Greenland after his father said US should own it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The eldest son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump arrived in
Greenland on Tuesday for a private visit that heightened speculation
that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to take control of the
mineral-rich Danish territory.</p>
<p>The Danish state broadcaster reported that Donald Trump Jr.’s plane
landed in Nuuk, capital of the vast and icy territory that has some
57,000 residents. Local media broadcast footage of him walking across a
snowy tarmac.</p>
<p>In a statement, Greenland’s government said that Trump Jr.’s visit
would take place “as a private individual” and not as an official visit
and that Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Greenland
is an autonomous territory that’s part of Denmark.</p>
<p>Mininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary for the Greenland Foreign
Affairs department, told The Associated Press that authorities were
informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours.</p>
<p>Neither Trump Jr.’s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials
had requested a meeting, Kleist said.</p>
<p>The visit nonetheless had political overtones.</p>
<p>The president-elect recently voiced a desire — also expressed during
his first presidency — to acquire the territory in the Arctic, an area
of strategic importance for the United States, China, Russia and
others.</p>
<p>The world’s largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and
Arctic oceans and is home to a large U.S. military base. It is 80%
covered by an ice sheet.</p>
<p>“I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’ My son, Don
Jr., and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some
of the most magnificent areas and sights,” the president-elect posted on
his social media site Monday night, referring to his “Make America Great
Again” slogan.</p>
<p>“Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit
tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation,” Trump wrote.
“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world.
MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”</p>
<p>Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede has called for independence from
Denmark, saying in a New Year’s speech that it would be a way for
Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said
he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States,
insisting that the island is not for sale.</p>
<p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future
of Greenland would be decided by Greenland and called the United States
Denmark’s most important ally.</p>
<p>Denmark’s King Frederik X has been asserting the kingdom’s rights to
Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago
located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Last month, the king changed Denmark’s coat of arms to include fields
that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented
by a silver bear with a red tongue. The royal announcement noted that
since 1194, the royal coat of arms “visually symbolized the legitimacy
and sovereignty of the state and the monarch.”</p>
<p>“We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of
Denmark,” the king said in his New Year’s address, adding: “all the way
to Greenland.”</p>
<p>During his first term, the U.S. president-elect mused about
purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He
canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime
minister dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>Reviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick
for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: “For purposes of national
security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America
feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute
necessity.”</p>
<p>Trump’s eldest son has become a prominent player in his father’s
political movement and has served on his presidential transition team,
helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White
House.</p>

Microgrids for Data Centers? Not as Crazy as It Sounds!</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
After a year of concerted hand-wringing about the growing energy needs
of data centers, a report that dropped just before the holidays proposed
a solution that had been strangely absent from the discussion.
</p>
<p>
AI companies have seemingly grasped for every imaginable source of clean
energy to quench their thirst for power, including pricey, left-field
ideas like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>restarting
shuttered nuclear plants</u></a>. Some are foregoing climate concerns
altogether and ordering up
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>off-grid
natural gas turbines</u></a>. In a pithily named new analysis — “Fast,
scalable, clean, and cheap enough” — the report’s authors make a
compelling case for an alternative: off-grid solar microgrids.
</p>
<p>
An off-grid solar microgrid is a system with solar panels, batteries,
and small gas generators that can work together to power a data center
directly without connecting to the wider electricity system. It can have
infinite possible configurations, such as greater or smaller numbers of
solar panels, and more or less gas-generated capacity. The
<a href="https://www.offgridai.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
models the full range of possibilities to illustrate the trade-offs in
terms of emission reductions and cost.
</p>
<p>
An eclectic group of experts got together to do the research, including
staffers from the payment company Stripe, a developer called Scale
Microgrids, and Paces, which builds software to help renewable energy
developers identify viable sites for projects. They found that an
off-grid microgrid that supplied 44% of a data center’s demand from
solar panels and used a natural gas generator the rest of the time would
cost roughly $93 per megawatt-hour compared to about $86 for large,
off-grid natural gas turbines — and it would emit nearly one million
tons of CO2 less than the gas turbines. A cleaner system that produced
90% of its power from solar and batteries would cost closer to $109 per
megawatt-hour, the authors found. While that’s more expensive than gas
turbines, it’s significantly cheaper than repowering Three Mile Island,
the fabled nuclear plant that Microsoft is bringing back online for an
estimated $130 per megawatt-hour.
</p>
<p>
One challenge with solar microgrids is that they require a lot of land
for solar panels. But a geospatial analysis showed that there’s more
than enough available land in the U.S. southwest — primarily in West
Texas — to cover estimated energy demand growth from data centers
through 2030. This shouldn’t be taken as a recommendation, per se. The
paper doesn’t interrogate the need for data centers or the trade-offs of
building renewable power for AI training facilities versus to serve
manufacturing or households. The report is just an exercise in asking
whether, <em><em>if</em></em> these data centers are going to be
developed, could they at least add as few emissions as possible? Not all
hyperscalers care about climate, and those that do might still
prioritize speed and scale over their net-zero commitments. But the
authors argue that it’s possible to build these systems more quickly
than it would be to install big gas turbines, which currently have at
least three-year lead times to procure and fall under more complicated
permitting regimes.
</p>
<p>
Before the New Year, I spoke with two of the authors — Zeke Hausfather
from Stripe and Duncan Campbell from Scale Microgrids — about the
report. Stripe doesn’t build data centers and has no plans to, but
Hausfather works for a unit within the company called Stripe Climate,
which has a “remit to work on impactful things,” he told me. He and his
colleagues got interested in the climate dilemma of data centers, and
enlisted Scale Microgrids and Paces to help investigate. Our
conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why weren’t off-grid solar microgrids really being considered
before?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Zeke Hausfather: </strong>As AI has grown dramatically, there’s
been much more demand for data centers specifically focused on training.
Those data centers have a lot more relaxed requirements. Instead of
serving millions of customer requests in real time, they’re running
these incredibly energy intensive training models. Those don’t need to
necessarily be located near where people live, and that unlocks a lot
more potential for solar, because you need about 50 times more land to
build a data center with off-grid solar and storage than you would to
build a data center that had a grid connection.
</p>
<p>
The other change is that we’re simply running out of good grid
connections. And so a lot of the conversation among data center
developers has been focused on, is there a way to do this with off-grid
natural gas? We think that it makes a lot more sense, particularly given
the relaxed constraints of where you can build these, to go with solar
and storage, gas back-up, and substantially reduce the emissions impact.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duncan Campbell:</strong> It was funny, when Nan [Ransohoff,
head of climate at Stripe] and Zeke first reached out to me, I feel like
they convinced me that microgrids were a good idea, which was the first
time this ever happened in my life. They were like, what do you think
about off-grid solar and storage? <em><em>Oh, the energy density is way
off, you need a ton of land.</em></em> They’re like, yeah, but you know,
for training, you could put it out in the desert, it’s fine, and
hyperscalers are doing crazy things right now to access this power. We
just went through all these things, and by the end of the call, I was
like, yeah, we should do this study. I wasn’t thinking about it this way
until me, the microgrids guy, spoke to the payments company.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So it’s just kind of against conventional logic?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell: </strong>Going off-grid at all is wild for a data
center operator to consider, given the historical impulse was, let’s
have 3x more backup generators than we need. Even the off-grid gas
turbine proposals out there feel a little nuts. Then, to say solar,
1,000 acres of land, a million batteries — it’s just so unconventional,
it’s almost heretical. But when you soberly assess the performance
criteria and how the landscape has shifted, particularly access to the
grid being problematic right now, but also different requirements for AI
training and a very high willingness to pay — as we demonstrate in our
reference case with the Three Mile Island restart — it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>We should be clear, when we talk about
reliability, a data center with what we model, which is solar,
batteries, and 125% capacity backup gas generators, is still probably
going to achieve upwards of 99% reliability. It’s just not gonna be the
99.999% that’s traditionally been needed for serving customers with data
centers. You can relax some of the requirements around that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can you explain how you went about investigating what it would
mean for data centers to use off-grid solar microgrids?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell:</strong> First we just built a pretty simple power
flow model that says, if you’re in a given location, the solar panel is
going to make this much power every hour of the year. And if you have a
certain amount of demand and a certain amount of battery, the battery is
going to charge and discharge these times to make the demand and supply
match. And then when it can’t, your generators will kick on. So that
model is just for a given solar-battery-generator combo in a given
location. Then what we did is made a huge scenario suite in 50-megawatt
increments. Now you can see, for any level of renewable-ness you want,
here’s what the [levelized cost of energy] is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>As you approach 100%, the costs start
increasing exponentially, which isn’t a new finding, but you’re
essentially having to overbuild more and more solar and batteries in
order to deal with those few hours of the year where you have extended
periods of cloudiness. Which is why it makes a lot more sense,
financially, to have a system with some gas generator use — unless you
happen to be in a situation where you can actually only run your data
center 90% of the time. I think that’s probably a little too heretical
for anyone today, but we did include that as one of the cases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Did you consider water use? Because when you zoom in on the
Southwest, that seems like it could be a constraint. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>We talked about water use a little bit, but
it wasn’t a primary consideration. One of the reasons is that how data
centers are designed has a big effect on net water use. There are a lot
of designs now that are pretty low — close to zero — water use, because
you’re cycling water through the system rather than using evaporative
cooling as the primary approach.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you want the takeaway from this report to be? Should all
data centers be doing this? To what extent do you think this can replace
other options out there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather:</strong> There is a land rush right now for building
data centers quickly. While there’s a lot of exciting investment
happening in clean, firm generation like the enhanced geothermal that
Fervo is doing, none of those are going to be available at very large
scales until after 2030. So if you’re building data centers right now
and you don’t want to cause a ton of emissions and threaten your
company’s net-zero targets or the social license for AI more broadly,
this makes a lot of sense as an option. The cost premium above building
a gas system is not that big.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell:</strong> For me, it’s two things. I see one purpose of
this white paper being to reset rules of thumb. There’s this vestigial
knowledge we have that this is impossible, and no, this is totally
possible. And it seems actually pretty reasonable.
</p>
<p>
The second part that I think is really radical is the gigantic scale
implied by this solution. Every other solution being proposed is kind of
like finding a needle in a haystack — if we find this old steel mill, we
could use that interconnection to build a data center, or, you know,
maybe we can get Exxon to make carbon capture work finally. If a
hyperscaler just wanted to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, and
wanted one plan to do it, I think this is the most compelling option.
The scalability implied by this solution is a huge factor that should be
considered.

shelves fact-checking program in US, adopts X-like ‘Community Notes’
model</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Meta is ending its fact-checking program in the U.S. and replacing it
with a “Community Notes” system similar to that on Elon Musk-owned X,
the Facebook parent said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The Community Notes model will allow users on Meta’s social media
sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads to call out posts that are
potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the
responsibility on independent fact checking organizations and
experts.  </p>
<p>“Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives.
This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how
… A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor,” Meta
said.  </p>
<p>Meta added that its efforts over the years to manage content across
its platforms have expanded “to the point where we are making too many
mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the
free expression we set out to enable.” </p>
<p>The company said it would begin phasing in Community Notes in the
United States over the next couple of months and would improve the model
over the course of the year. </p>
<p>It will also stop demoting fact-checked content and use a label
notifying users there is additional information related to the post,
instead of the company’s current method of displaying full-screen
warnings that users have to click through before even viewing the
post.</p>

winds force Biden to cancel event announcing two new national
monuments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Dangerously high winds forced U.S. President Joe Biden
to cancel a trip Tuesday to the Eastern Coachella Valley, where he was
to announce the creation of two new national monuments in California
that will honor Native American tribes.</p>
<p>Winds began gaining strength across Southern California as
forecasters warned of “life-threatening, destructive” gusts. The
president was in his limousine ready to leave Los Angeles when the event
was canceled. The White House initially said Biden would speak in Los
Angeles but later announced the event would be rescheduled at the White
House next week at a time when others could attend.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said it could be the strongest Santa Ana
windstorm in more than a decade and it will peak in the early hours of
Wednesday, when gusts could reach 129 kilometers per hour. Isolated
gusts could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcement was part of his administration’s effort to
conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through his
“America the Beautiful” initiative. But the cancellation of the trip was
also a stark reminder of another administration priority: climate change
and the increasing effects of extreme weather.</p>
<p>The proclamations name the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern
California near Joshua Tree National Park and the Sattitla National
Monument in Northern California. The declarations bar drilling and
mining and other development on the 2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla
site and roughly 800 square kilometers near the Oregon border in
Northern California.</p>
<p>The new monuments protect clean water for communities, honor areas of
cultural significance to tribal nations and Indigenous peoples and
enhance access to nature, the White House said.</p>
<p>Biden, who has two weeks left in office, announced Monday he will ban
new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including
in California and other West Coast states. The plan is intended to block
possible efforts by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore
drilling.</p>
<p>The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic
president’s “America the Beautiful” initiative launched in 2021, aimed
at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of
public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.</p>
<p>The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to
designate the Sattitla National Monument. The area is a spiritual center
for the Pit River and Modoc Tribes and encompasses mountain woodlands
and meadows that are home to rare flowers and wildlife.</p>
<p>Several Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing
Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the
large desert lizard, in early 2023. The monument would protect public
lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley
region in the west to near the Colorado River.</p>
<p>Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape,
ensure access to nature for residents and preserve military history
sites.</p>
<p>“The designation of the Chuckwalla and Sattitla National Monuments in
California marks an historic step toward protecting lands of profound
cultural, ecological and historical significance for all Americans,”
said Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust
for Public Land.</p>
<p>The new monuments “honor the enduring stewardship of Tribal Nations
and the tireless efforts of local communities and conservation advocates
who fought to safeguard these irreplaceable landscapes for future
generations,’’ Hauser said.</p>
<p>Senator Alex Padilla of California called the new monuments a major
victory that will safeguard the state’s public lands for generations to
come.</p>
<p>Designation of the Chuckwalla monument “accelerates our state’s
crucial efforts to fight the climate crisis, protect our iconic
wildlife, preserve sacred tribal sites and promote clean energy,”
Padilla said. The new Sattitla monument, meanwhile, ensures that land
that has “long served as the spiritual center for the Pit River and
Modoc Nation” will “endure for generations to come,” Padilla said.</p>
<p>The Chuckwalla monument is intended to honor tribal sovereignty by
including local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a
recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in
Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.</p>
<p>“The protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the
Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,” the Fort Yuma
Quechan Tribe said in a statement. “Tribes being reunited as stewards of
this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and
restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this
place.”</p>
<p>In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in
California — the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow
Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage
National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which
will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is
preserved.</p>
<p>Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the
first Native people to manage tribal land with the National Park Service
under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe,
Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods
League, which is conveying the land to the tribe.</p>

visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/TOKYO — U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to block
Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel cast a shadow over
Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Japan on Tuesday for
farewell meetings with Washington’s most important ally in Asia.</p>
<p>The rejection, announced on Friday, has jolted U.S. efforts to boost
ties with Asian allies just as South Korea’s political crisis
potentially complicates a revived relationship between Washington, Seoul
and Tokyo. The trilateral alliance is a key plank in the countries’
efforts to counter China’s military buildup.</p>
<p>Investment into the U.S. could also be chilled, but analysts say any
damage to the wider U.S.-Japan relationship will likely be limited given
shared security concerns about China.</p>
<p>On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described Biden’s
decision to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel as
“perplexing.”</p>
<p>Accompanied by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan,
Blinken met Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo and will
hold talks later in the day with Ishiba and other senior Japanese
officials</p>
<p>Numerous trips to Japan over the last four years “is evidence, not
just of the importance, but of the centrality the United States attaches
to our partnership. President Biden asked me to come on this last trip
to underscore that,” Blinken told Iwaya.</p>
<p>“We have, between our two countries, a partnership that started out
focusing on bilateral issues, that worked on regional issues and that
now is genuinely global,” he added.</p>
<p>Ahead of his trip, the State Department said that Blinken wanted to
build on the momentum of U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral
cooperation.</p>
<p>In Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea’s
handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought an
extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>
<p>Allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have also reassured Seoul
and Tokyo that he will support continuing to improve ties and advance
military, economic and diplomatic cooperation to counter China and North
Korea, Reuters reported ahead of Trump’s Nov. 5 re-election.</p>
<p>Tension, limited damage from Nippon Steel decision</p>
<p>Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that
Biden violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking their $14.9 billion
merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They
called for the U.S. federal court to overturn the decision.</p>
<p>Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington’s Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said Biden’s decision would make
Blinken’s Tokyo visit “awkward.”</p>

next round of bitter cold and snow will hit the southern US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Annapolis, Maryland — The next round of bitter cold was set to
envelop the southern U.S. on Tuesday, after the first significant winter
storm of the year blasted a huge swath of the country with ice, snow and
wind.</p>
<p>The immense storm system brought disruption even to areas of the
country that usually escape winter’s wrath, downing trees in some
Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in
Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.</p>
<p>By early Tuesday, wind chill temperatures could dip as low as minus
10.5 C from Texas across the Gulf Coast, according to the National
Weather Service. A low-pressure system is then expected to form as soon
as Wednesday near south Texas, bringing the potential of snow to parts
of the state that include Dallas, as well as to Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Louisiana.</p>
<p>The polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the
country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip Monday, making many roads
treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power
outages and flight cancellations.</p>
<p>Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and
parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help
stranded motorists. The National Weather Service issued winter storm
warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind
gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early
Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Kentucky truck stop was jammed with big rigs forced off an icy and
snow-covered Interstate 75 on Monday just outside Cincinnati. A
long-haul driver from Los Angeles carrying a load of rugs to Georgia,
Michael Taylor said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches and
was dealing with icy windshield wipers before he pulled off the
interstate.</p>
<p>“It was too dangerous. I didn’t want to kill myself or anyone else,”
he said.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes plunges south into the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the
increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.</p>
<p>Temperatures plunge across the country</p>
<p>The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. dealt with bone-chilling cold and
wind chills Monday, with temperatures in some areas far below
normal.</p>
<p>A cold weather advisory will take effect early Tuesday across the
Gulf Coast. In Texas’ capital of Austin and surrounding cities, wind
chills could drop as low as minus 9.4 C.</p>
<p>The Northeast was expected to get several cold days.</p>
<p>Transportation has been tricky</p>
<p>Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas
and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening
injuries after his patrol car was hit.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police responded to at least 430 crashes Sunday and
Monday, including one that was fatal. Police said other weather-related
fatal accidents occurred Sunday near Charleston, West Virginia, and
Monday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Kansas saw two deadly crashes
over the weekend.</p>
<p>More than 2,300 flights were canceled and at least 9,100 more were
delayed nationwide as of Monday night, according to tracking platform
FlightAware. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported that
about 58% of arrivals and 70% of departures had been canceled.</p>
<p>A record of more than 20 centimeters of snow fell Sunday at the
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, leading to dozens of
flight cancellations that lingered into Monday. About 10 centimeters
fell Monday across the Cincinnati area, where car and truck crashes shut
at least two major routes leading into downtown.</p>
<p>More snow and ice are expected</p>
<p>In Indiana, snow covered stretches of Interstate 64, Interstate 69
and U.S. Route 41, leading authorities to plead with people to stay
home.</p>
<p>“It’s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a
half hour the roadways are completely covered again,” State Police
Sgt. Todd Ringle said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands are without power</p>
<p>Many were in the dark as temperatures plunged. More than 218,000
customers were without power Monday night across Kentucky, Indiana,
Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina,
according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us.</p>
<p>In Virginia’s capital city, a power outage caused a temporary
malfunction in the water system, officials said Monday afternoon.
Richmond officials asked those in the city of more than 200,000 people
to refrain from drinking tap water or washing dishes without boiling the
water first. The city also asked people to conserve their water, such as
by taking shorter showers.</p>
<p>City officials said they were working nonstop to bring the system
back online.</p>

id="how-carters-covert-aid-to-afghan-rebels-redefined-his-foreign-policy-record">How
Carter’s covert aid to Afghan rebels redefined his foreign policy
record</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan is often credited with defeating the Soviet
Union, in part by helping Afghan rebels, but it was the administration
of President Jimmy Carter that laid the groundwork.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Considered a foreign policy novice by many when he entered the White
House, Carter made the early decision to provide covert aid to Afghan
insurgents months before the Soviet invasion. The move offers a window
into one of the defining issues of his presidency, showing a president
unafraid to confront the Soviets while pursuing a policy of détente.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think people’s image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply
moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he’s done after he
left office. [But] he definitely had a ruthless side to him, and he had
a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons,”
said David Gibbs, a history professor at the University of Arizona. </p>
<p>The covert aid program initiated under Carter became the backbone of
the Afghan insurgency, setting the stage for the Soviet Union’s eventual
withdrawal in 1989.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a bold move six months before the Soviets’ December 1979 invasion,
Carter signed a secret directive known as a “presidential finding” that
authorized the CIA to provide nonlethal aid to rebels fighting
Afghanistan’s Soviet-backed communist government.</p>
<p>That finding stayed under wraps for nearly two decades, coming to
light only when several Carter administration officials, including
former CIA Director Robert Gates and national security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski, disclosed its existence in the 1990s, suggesting the Carter
administration aimed to lure the Soviets into a Vietnam-style
quagmire.</p>
<p>‘Afghan trap’</p>
<p>Brzezinski’s revelations were the most striking. In a 1998 interview
with a French magazine, Carter’s Polish-born, ardently anti-communist
adviser denied provoking the Soviets but claimed the administration had
“knowingly increased the probability” of a Soviet invasion. Calling the
program “an excellent idea,” he said it had the “effect of drawing the
Russians into the Afghan trap.”</p>
<p>Although Brzezinski later disputed the accuracy of the interview and
never repeated the claim, the so-called “Afghan trap” thesis gained
traction, with critics excoriating the Carter administration for
instigating the Soviet invasion and causing decades of conflict in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Among scholars who see the aid program as a deliberate provocation,
Gibbs said he was initially loath to read too much into the Brzezinski
interview before becoming convinced of its veracity.</p>
<p>As Gibbs described it to VOA, a military aide once told historian
Jonathan Haslam that Brzezinski, upon learning of the Soviet invasion,
“pumped his first in the air in triumph and said, ‘They’ve taken the
bait!’”</p>
<p>“The implication was that the decision to supply aid to the
mujahideen was bait,” Gibbs said. “That, to me, is a strong indication
that what he said is true, because it was said twice over a period of
time, and it’s from the horse’s mouth.”</p>
<p>The Afghan trap thesis has permeated the works of other prominent
experts, although most now dismiss it as baseless, according to
historian Conor Tobin of the University College Dublin, who has
researched it.</p>
<p>The problem with the theory, Tobin argues, is that it views the
Carter administration’s involvement in Afghanistan through a 21st
century lens, “working backwards from the events of 9/11.”</p>
<p>“They rely almost exclusively on Gates’ memoirs, the controversial
French interview and other circumstantial and limited anecdotal evidence
without exploring the subject in detail, and without using any other
sources to corroborate the statements made,” Tobin told VOA via
email.</p>
<p>A close look at recently declassified Carter-era documents tells a
different story, Tobin said.</p>
<p>“It reveals that there was no attempt to ensnare the Soviet Union in
the Afghan trap, and U.S. policies were in fact marginal in leading to
the Soviet military intervention,” he said.</p>
<p>Nonlethal aid</p>
<p>What is not up for debate, however, is that the aid program was
launched in response to rising Soviet influence in Afghanistan. A
communist coup in April 1978 toppled the government of President
Mohammad Daoud. The new regime then initiated radical reforms, sparking
public opposition and eventually a full-blown insurgency.</p>
<p>According to Tobin, the Carter administration initially took a
“wait-and-see” approach. That policy ended with the kidnapping and
murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs the following February. Brzezinski
then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“Should we help any insurgents?” he asked an aide to investigate,
according to Tobin. “With whom would we have to work?”</p>
<p>A popular revolt in the western Afghan city of Herat, however, “led
to a shift in attitude in Washington and the consensus began to slide
towards a more active role,” Tobin wrote in his analysis, “The Myth of
the ‘Afghan Trap’.” </p>
<p>CIA operatives sprang into action, developing a plan of action while
reaching out to U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Several options
were formulated, ranging from small-scale propaganda campaigns and
nonlethal support to lethal arms supplies and military training via a
third country.</p>
<p>After determining that military assistance may “provoke vigorous
Soviet countermeasures,” the administration settled on nonlethal
aid.</p>
<p>“The decision-making process demonstrated caution, rather than an
effort to induce an invasion,” Tobin wrote.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1979, Carter authorized the CIA to provide up to $695,000
in aid to the insurgents. By mid-August, $575,000 of the funds had been
allocated for cash, medical equipment and radio transmitters to
Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, who then delivered them to the
mujahideen, according to Tobin’s account.</p>
<p>The aid program, says Tobin, was modest but significant in two key
respects. It helped establish links with the mujahideen through
Pakistani intelligence that would prove invaluable after the Soviet
invasion. It also underscored American resolve to allies Pakistan and
Saudi Arabia, reassuring them at a time when concerns about diminishing
U.S. influence in the region were mounting.</p>
<p>The aid program came against a backdrop of escalating Cold War
tensions. The Iranian Revolution of February 1979 had robbed the U.S. of
a key strategic ally in the region. Rather than seeking to provoke the
Soviets, Brzezinski worried about a “creeping intervention” in
Afghanistan, fearing ‘’Moscow would continue to expand its influence
until a de factor invasion had taken place,’’ Tobin wrote. </p>
<p>“The objectives in mid-1979 were essentially to do something,
anything, to counter the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,” Tobin said.</p>
<p>Historian Scott Kaufman of Francis Marion University and author of a
book on Carter’s foreign policy, said the late president also had to
consider his bid for re-election the following year.</p>
<p>“He was already under attack for having ‘lost’ Nicaragua to
communists and for being ‘soft’ on the Soviet Union,” Kaufman told VOA
via email. “How would it look to voters if Carter, who wanted to get
SALT II [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] approved, made moves that
encouraged what would be seen by them as further Soviet aggression.”</p>
<p>‘Carter Doctrine’</p>
<p>Kaufman took issue with the popular perception of Carter as a foreign
policy novice. Though he lacked the foreign policy experience of a
Richard Nixon or even Gerald Ford, Carter sat on the Trilateral
Commission and had traveled overseas as governor of Georgia, Kaufman
noted.</p>
<p>“That said, his support for the mujahideen reflected a foreign policy
that since at least 1978 reflected a hardening insofar as U.S. policy
toward the Soviet Union,” he said.</p>
<p>Carter’s tougher stance, Kaufman said, was driven by growing
anti-Soviet sentiment in Congress, Brzezinski’s influence, and his
personal disdain for Soviet repression and machinations.</p>
<p>“This does not mean that he had given up on seeking detente with the
Soviets, as reflected by his desire to get SALT II ratified,” he said.
“But his foreign policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. [Soviet Union]
demonstrated a preparedness to take a harder line.”</p>
<p>Nothing demonstrated Carter’s resolve more forcefully than the
“Carter Doctrine,” his bold Persian Gulf policy adopted in response to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Unveiling the new policy during his 1980 State of the Union address,
Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use “any means necessary” to
prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf region.</p>
<p>With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Carter administration
upped the ante. On December 28, 1979, the day after Soviet commandos
assassinated Afghan President Hafizullah Amin in Kabul, Carter signed a
new finding that authorized the supply of weapons and training for the
mujahideen. The first batch of weapons arrived in Pakistan in less than
two weeks.</p>
<p>Carter went on to lose the 1980 election to Reagan, whose
administration largely continued Carter’s Afghan policy for several
years before dramatically building up the covert aid program to the tune
of several hundred million dollars a year. Instead of merely harassing
the Soviets, the Reagan administration sought its defeat, according to
Tobin.</p>
<p>“The criticism of the Carter administration as weak on defense,
therefore, is unjustified, with Carter largely laying the groundwork for
the renewed global containment of the 1980s,” Tobin said.</p>
<p>“So, despite enduring orthodox assessments of Carter as a foreign
policy failure, he departed office in January 1981 leaving a clear
foreign policy direction for the incoming Reagan administration that
arguably contributed to the end of the Cold War a decade later — an
outcome that was almost incomprehensible as the Carter administration
took office in January 1977.”</p>

accuses Russia of funding both sides of Sudan’s war</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS — The United States accused Russia at the United
Nations on Monday of funding the two warring parties in Sudan, an
apparent step up from Washington’s previous assertion that Moscow was
playing both sides of the conflict to advance its political
objectives.</p>
<p>The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the
Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)
ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world’s
largest displacement and hunger crisis.</p>
<p>In November Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution
that called on the warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and
ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid. The remaining 14 council
members voted in favor of the text.</p>
<p>“Russia chose obstruction: standing alone as it voted to imperil
civilians, while funding both sides of the conflict – yes, that’s what I
said: both sides,” the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda
Thomas-Greenfield, told the council on Monday, without giving further
details.</p>
<p>When asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the
U.N. said Washington was aware of Russia’s “ongoing interest in Sudan’s
gold trade” and condemns any material support for the warring parties –
“whether it be through illicit gold trading or the provision of military
equipment.”</p>
<p>“We believe Sudanese authorities’ gold mining cooperation with
sanctioned Russian entities and individuals could prove inimical to
Sudan’s long-term interests and the aspirations of the Sudanese people
for an end to the war,” the U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>In response, Russia’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said:
“We regret that the U.S. tries to judge other world powers by its own
yardstick.”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that in the Pax Americana which our American colleagues
try to preserve at any price, relations with other countries are built
only on their exploitation and criminal schemes aimed at U.S.
enrichment,” he said.</p>
<p>Reuters was unable to immediately contact Sudan’s warring parties for
comment.</p>
<p>In December, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected what
he called “fabrications spread by Western countries and their media”
that Moscow was trying to play both sides to gain an advantage from the
war.</p>
<p>At what she said would likely be her last council meeting,
Thomas-Greenfield became visibly emotional while addressing her
counterparts on Sudan, a crisis that has been a focus for her during her
four years at the world body.</p>
<p>“For all the disappointment that I couldn’t do more, that we – all of
us – didn’t do more – I still remain hopeful,” she said. “Hopeful that
the representatives sitting around this table – the colleagues who have
become friends – will continue this sacred mission, this ultimate
responsibility.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield was appointed by President Joe Biden. Donald Trump
will succeed Biden on Jan. 20.</p>

id="us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military">US
adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s
military</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it
has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader
Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work
with China’s military.</p>
<p>The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies,
Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document
published on Monday.</p>
<p>The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally
mandated under U.S. law as the “Section 1260H list,” designated 134
companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.</p>
<p>U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese
instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading.
Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly
a mistake.” It added: “We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike
sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our
business.”</p>
<p>CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it “is not engaged in
any military related activities.”</p>
<p>A Quectel spokesperson said the company “does not work with the
military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its
designation, which clearly has been made in error.”</p>
<p>The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not
respond to requests or did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Amid strained relations between the world’s two biggest economies,
the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in
recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose
security risks.</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, said the additions showed that it was “reckless” for
American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese
corporations.</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,”
he said. “The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence
protecting them is being fortified. Today’s list lays bare that these
aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s
military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic
ambitions.”</p>
<p>Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic
sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have
alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies.
Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of
the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a
battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to
produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility – a move that
has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment
on Monday.</p>
<p>While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a
blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark
warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting
business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury
Department to sanction the companies.</p>
<p>Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker
Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous
designations but remain on the updated list.</p>
<p>The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the
requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii
Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State
Construction Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corporation.</p>

talk and tables walk at AI-dominated Consumer Electronics Show</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Home appliances that do chores, cars that know your
favorite cafe, and robot pets aiming to please are among artificial
intelligence-infused offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show opening
Tuesday.</p>
<p>All these will compete for attention at the annual CES extravaganza
in Las Vegas, as vendors behind the scenes seek ways to deal with
tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>AI is once again a major theme of the show, along with autonomous
vehicles ranging from tractors and boats to lawn mowers and golf club
trollies.</p>
<p>South Korean consumer electronics giant LG kicked off a media day
Monday by outlining a vision for “Affectionate Intelligence” in which
home appliances watch over people — from tracking how well they sleep to
making sure they remember umbrellas when rain is in the forecast.</p>
<p>“At LG, we’re seamlessly integrating AI into physical living spaces
around us,” said CEO William Cho.</p>
<p>“We see space not merely as a physical location but as an environment
where holistic experiences come to life — across the Home, Mobility,
Commercial and even Virtual spaces.”</p>
<p>Before the show floor even opened, vendors enticed visitors with
electric roller skates, hologram booths for life-size remote
collaboration, and even a robot that looked like a lamp affixed to the
top of a walking table.</p>
<p>Most offerings boasted being enhanced with AI.</p>
<p>“Everybody is going to be talking about AI … whether it is there or
not,” Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP.</p>
<p>AI on the move</p>
<p>CES will also be a gigantic auto show, with carmakers and those
supplying software and parts showing off self-driving and automated
safety capabilities.</p>
<p>“CES has been an auto show for a while now, and if anything, it is
more so this year,” said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump is expected to
reduce regulatory speed bumps regarding autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And while still far from being a part of everyday life, flying cars
will be part of the CES scene, according to independent tech analyst Rob
Enderle.</p>
<p>“You should start seeing flying vehicles you can buy,” Enderle said.
“Getting approval to fly them is a whole other matter.”</p>
<p>Robots designed to handle work tasks or be comforting companions —
and even adorable pets — are among CES’ exhibits.</p>
<p>Gadgets for calming the mind, beautifying the body, or helping get a
sound night’s sleep are on display as tech continues to seep into every
aspect of existence.</p>
<p>“Digital health is going to be huge,” said Greengart.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a lot more tech being worn or used to track your
health markers.”</p>
<p>AI-enhanced tech will also be infusing homes, from a spice dispenser
that “learns” a cook’s taste and robot swimming pool cleaners.</p>
<p>Tariff anxiety?</p>
<p>Tariffs talked about by Trump would raise costs for imported items,
and that will likely be on the minds of CES attendees targeting the U.S.
market, according to analysts.</p>
<p>A lot of the products at the show have imported components, and if
Trump hits Canada, China and Mexico with tariffs, it will mean a spike
in prices, analyst Enderle said.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of concerned vendors at CES,” Enderle said of
the tariff trepidation.</p>
<p>Talk at CES will include how to navigate supply chain constraints
that could be caused by tariffs, according to Greengart.</p>
<p>“But a lot of the talk will happen behind closed doors to not anger
the coming administration,” he added.</p>
<p>Chinese companies with significant U.S. presence, like smart
television rivals TCL and Hisense, are at CES.</p>
<p>But Greengart warns of a “growing bifurcation of market between China
and the rest of the world” as trade frictions play out.</p>

dramatically shrinks Guantanamo prisoner population to 15 men</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration slashed the
prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba by nearly
half on Monday, sending 11 detainees to Oman.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said only 15 detainees remained there after the
transfer, following a major push toward closing the facility by Biden’s
administration in its final days in office.</p>
<p>The detention center was first opened on Jan. 11, 2002, by President
George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects and “illegal enemy combatants”
during the U.S. “War on Terror” following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on
New York and Washington.</p>
<p>Guantanamo Bay housed roughly 680 prisoners at the detention center’s
peak in 2003, according to Pentagon data.</p>
<p>The latest transfer of the 11 men, all of whom are from Yemen, leaves
the U.S. naval base in Cuba with fewer detainees than when it opened
with the arrival of prisoners from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“The United States appreciates the willingness of the government of
Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on
responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the
Guantanamo Bay facility,” the U.S. military said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Pentagon named the 11 men transferred as: Uthman Abd al-Rahim
Muhammad Uthman, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, Khalid Ahmed Qassim, Suhayl
Abdul Anam al Sharabi, Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, Tawfiq Nasir Awad
Al-Bihani, Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah, Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi,
Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash, Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj and Abd
Al-Salam Al-Hilah.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 15 detainees, the Pentagon said three are eligible
for transfer and an equal number are eligible for a periodic review
board to examine their cases. The remainder have been charged or
convicted of war crimes.</p>
<p>The facility has long been criticized by human rights groups and
legal advocates over potential breaches of international human rights
laws and conditions at the camp.</p>

id="minneapolis-to-revamp-police-training-force-policies-after-george-floyds-murder">Minneapolis
to revamp police training, force policies after George Floyd’s
murder</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis City Council on Monday approved an
agreement with the federal government to overhaul the city’s police
training and use-of-force policies in the wake of the murder of George
Floyd. </p>
<p>The deal incorporates and builds on changes the Minneapolis Police
Department has made since Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white
officer in 2020, prompting a national reckoning with police brutality
and racism. </p>
<p>The 171-page agreement, filed in federal court shortly after the
council’s 12-0 vote, says the department will require its officers to
“promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their
activities.” It says officers must “carry out their law enforcement
duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every
person.” And it says they must not allow race, gender or ethnicity “to
influence any decision to use force, including the amount or type of
force used.” </p>
<p>The agreement, known as a consent decree, means the department will
be under long-term court supervision. It had been under negotiation
since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city’s
police in June 2023. </p>
<p>The report alleged that police systematically discriminated against
racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the
safety of people in custody for years before Floyd’s killing. </p>
<p>The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year
investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police
conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used
excessive force, including “unjustified deadly force,” and violated the
rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech. </p>
<p>An independent monitor will oversee the changes, and a judge must
approve them. </p>
<p>During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was
critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis
agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for
him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court
approval. </p>
<p>The council approved the deal 12-0 Monday during a brief public vote
that followed an hours-long, closed-door discussion. </p>
<p>“I’d like to thank our community for standing together, united in
this, and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very
long and challenging journey,” Council President Elliott Payne said
after the vote. “We’re just beginning, and we know we have a long way to
go. Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what
is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our
city.” </p>
<p>Council Member Robin Wonsley said in a statement before the vote that
she has “no faith that the Trump administration will be a serious
partner” in implementing the agreement. </p>
<p>“Having a federal consent decree signed and in place is valuable to
police reform efforts, but we need to be sober about the fact that it
will take local political will to hold the city and the (Mayor Jacob)
Frey administration accountable to implementing and enforcing the terms
of the consent decree,” she said. </p>
<p>A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between
Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state
agency issued its own blistering report in 2022. The state investigation
found that the city’s police had engaged in a pattern of race
discrimination for at least a decade. </p>
<p>The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state
and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to
high-profile deaths at the hands of police. </p>
<p>It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore,
Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville,
Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting
of Breonna Taylor is awaiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the
mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree
there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the
beating death of Tyre Nichols. </p>
<p>Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before
federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and
millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O’Hara as
police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in
Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city
would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and
state consent decrees.</p>

id="two-indian-companies-indicted-in-us-for-importing-ingredients-used-in-opioid-fentanyl">Two
Indian companies indicted in US for importing ingredients used in opioid
fentanyl</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Two Indian chemical companies have been indicted for
allegedly importing ingredients for the highly addictive opioid fentanyl
into the United States and Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice said
Monday. </p>
<p>Athos Chemicals and Raxuter Chemicals, both based in Gujarat, were
each charged in Brooklyn with distributing the ingredients and
conspiring to distribute them. </p>
<p>Raxuter and senior executive Bhavesh Lathiya, 36, were also charged
with smuggling, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate
commerce. </p>
<p>Lathiya was arrested on Saturday in New York and ordered detained
pending trial, after prosecutors called him a flight risk and a
substantial danger to the community. </p>
<p>“The Justice Department is targeting every link in fentanyl
trafficking supply chains that span countries and continents and too
often end in tragedy in the United States,” U.S. Attorney General
Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>
<p>A federal public defender representing Lathiya declined to comment.
Athos and Raxuter did not immediately respond to similar requests
outside business hours. </p>
<p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 times more powerful than
heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. </p>
<p>Opioids accounted for about 82,000 U.S. deaths in 2022, 10 times the
number in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that since February 2024, the defendants supplied
“precursor” chemicals they knew would be used to make fentanyl, and hid
their efforts by mislabeling packages, falsifying customs forms, and
making false declarations at border crossings. </p>
<p>One indictment said that in October 2024 video calls with an
undercover agent posing as a fentanyl manufacturer, Lathiya agreed to
sell 20 kilograms of the precursor chemical 1-boc-4-piperidone, and
suggested mislabeling them as an antacid. </p>
<p>Lathiya did this after the agent told him his Mexico clients were
“very happy with the quality of what you sent me,” and with the “yield”
from the resulting fentanyl, the indictment said. </p>
<p>The other indictment said Athos agreed last February to sell 100
kilograms of the same chemical to a known drug trafficker in Mexico who
was making fentanyl in connection with a drug trafficking
organization. </p>
<p>Lathiya faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted, the Justice
Department said.</p>

id="former-new-york-city-mayor-rudy-giuliani-found-in-contempt-of-court-in-defamation-case">Former
New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani found in contempt of court in
defamation case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A judge on Monday found Rudy Giuliani to be in civil
contempt of court in a case brought by two Georgia election workers that
the former New York City mayor falsely accused of trying to help steal
the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not
complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her
daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine
which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation
judgment.</p>
<p>“The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others
is not an excuse for noncompliance,” Liman said.</p>
<p>The contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top
federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once
known as “America’s Mayor” for his response to the September 11, 2001,
attacks.</p>
<p>The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against
Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican
President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying
that they tried to help steal the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Giuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed
the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots
at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes.</p>
<p>Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020
election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and
Arizona that he aided Trump’s failed attempt to overturn his loss.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about
Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for
defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic
records to the two election workers.</p>
<p>A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss
roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment.</p>
<p>Liman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment
Giuliani would face for contempt.</p>
<p>But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions
from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he
owns.</p>
<p>Liman said he would presume Giuliani’s lack of response suggested the
answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over
whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman
and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could
be turned over.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani
in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment,
the title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is
still pending.</p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, has claimed that his day-to-day life has been upended
by the two election workers, making it difficult to obtain necessary
paperwork, and that he has not “willfully disobeyed” any court
orders.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, said on Monday that the time
frame for Giuliani to respond to the election workers’ demands was tight
but that he sought to comply.</p>
<p>“There’s been substantial compliance,” Cammarata said. “There is no
defiance to the court.”</p>

reports 1st bird flu-related death in US, state agency says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that a
U.S. patient hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu had died, the country’s
first death from an outbreak of the virus that has sickened dozens of
people and millions of poultry and cattle. </p>
<p>Nearly 70 people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu since April,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most
of them livestock workers exposed to sick chickens or dairy cattle. </p>
<p>The patient in Louisiana, the first person in the country to be
hospitalized with the virus, contracted bird flu after exposure to a
combination of backyard chickens and wild birds, said Louisiana health
officials. The patient was hospitalized on Dec. 18, state health
officials said. </p>
<p>The patient was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, the
officials said. </p>
<p>“While the current public health risk for the general public remains
low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational
exposure to them, are at higher risk,” the department said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria’s
transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after
Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last month.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license lasting six
months that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government,
including some energy sales and incidental transactions.</p>
<p>The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered
by more than a decade of war but indicates a limited show of U.S.
support for the new transitional government.</p>
<p>The general license underscores America’s commitment to ensuring its
sanctions “do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including
the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance,” a Treasury
Department statement said.</p>
<p>Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency “will
continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance
in Syria.”</p>
<p>Since Assad’s ouster, representatives from the nation’s new de facto
authorities have said the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the
world.</p>
<p>The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed
Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December
decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a
Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month.</p>
<p>The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS; Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with
al-Qaida; and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf,
who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad’s
ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended
his family’s decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad’s downfall,
Syria’s uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people.</p>
<p>Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of
his crackdown on protesters and sanctioned him and his Russian and
Iranian associates.</p>
<p>Most of the Western-led sanctions targeted Assad and his associates
for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the
amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions
of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across
Syria’s porous borders.</p>
<p>With Assad out of the picture, Syria’s new authorities hope the
international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its
battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again.</p>
<p>Syria’s infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in
the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half
the population won’t know where its next meal will come from as
inflation surges.</p>
<p>The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid
agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive
2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over
59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn’t be
fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the U.S. announcing
some humanitarian exemptions.</p>
<p>Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads
work on Syria, said ahead of the general license issuance:</p>
<p>“There is a general agreement,” among regional and international
governments, “that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos.”</p>
<p>“The only path forward is to engage positively,” he said.</p>

cyber watchdog: No signs Treasury breach hit other federal agencies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA said Monday there
was “no indication” the recently reported breach at the U.S. Treasury
Department had affected any other federal agency. </p>
<p>Late last month the U.S. Treasury reported that an unspecified number
of computers had been compromised by Chinese hackers following a breach
at contractor BeyondTrust, which provides cybersecurity services.  </p>
<p>BeyondTrust said last month that a limited number of clients were
affected but has not elaborated. </p>
<p>“As the forensic investigation is ongoing, BeyondTrust is unable to
confirm the other customers who may or may not have been impacted,” the
company said Monday in an email. </p>
<p>The Washington Post has reported that the hackers breached the U.S.
Treasury office that administers economic sanctions, aiming to steal
information about Chinese entities that the U.S. government might be
considering designating for financial sanctions. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have demanded a briefing about the breach, which
is the latest in a series of intrusions blamed on Beijing. </p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has
previously described the Treasury hack reports as “irrational” and
represented “smear attacks” against China.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
It’s a bad sign when they won’t tell you the exact numbers.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, Tesla released final production
<a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2024-production-deliveries-and-deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>figures</u></a>
for 2024, which saw the EV maker post a rare year-over-year decline in
sales growth. It’s likely that a slow start for the Cybertruck, Tesla’s
only new model in recent memory, was a big cause of the slowdown. But we
can’t tell you <em><em>exactly</em></em> how well or poorly the big
truck is doing because the company won’t tell us.
</p>
<p>
Tesla delivered
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-sales-2024" target="_self"><u>1,789,226
total vehicles</u></a> to customers last year. The popular, reasonably
affordable Model 3 or Model Y EVs made up more than 95% of those sales.
The remainder were lumped into a group called “other models,” meaning
Cybertruck and the long-in-the-tooth, expensive Model X and Model S, a
move that has the same flavor as a Friday afternoon news dump. The
“other models” accounted for just 85,133 deliveries, or 4.8% of Tesla’s
total.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve been following Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-sales-q3-2024" target="_self"><u>coverage</u></a>
then this comes as no surprise. Elon Musk &amp; Co. sold just shy of
17,000 Cybertrucks during the third quarter of last year (July to
September). That made the shiny metal beast the third-best-selling EV in
America after Tesla’s two volume sellers. But Cybertruck was a distant
third behind those two EVs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla
delivered 23,640 “other models,” meaning that’s the maximum number of
Cybertrucks it could have sold.
</p>
<p>
The writing for Tesla’s sales slump has been on the wall for years. A
recent design refresh helped bump Model 3 sales, and the company is
still working on a rumored update to the Model Y, the world’s
best-selling EV, that might give Tesla a shot in the arm. But with
Tesla’s future prospects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cheap-tesla" target="_self"><u>resting
with the Cybercab</u></a> and other autonomous aspirations, the
Cybertruck is the brand’s only current opportunity to boost its bottom
line with a new vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Except that the stainless steel war rig was never a good candidate for
high-volume sales. Cybertruck starts at $80,000. It has suffered
embarrassing viral moments where the vehicle failed at basic truck tasks
such as getting out of snow or sand. It comes with some cool amenities,
such as the ability to
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/hurricane-helene-electric-vehicle-power-outage/680106/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>back
up one’s home power supply</u></a> via bidirectional charging. It also
serves as the avatar of everything Elon, making the car a polarizing
hard pass for anyone who
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/anti-elon-bumper-sticker-tesla" target="_self"><u>doesn’t
want to be publicly profiled</u></a> as a Musk fan.

Cybertruck endured a slow start dogged by production delays and nagging,
frequent recalls. Soon it became evident that demand for the vehicle
wasn’t exactly red-hot. Musk at one point has claimed that a million
people put their names down for a Cybertruck, but doing so cost only
$100, so the length of that list doesn’t mean much. More telling was the
report that Tesla was scrubbing the badging off the limited-edition
Foundation series, which wasn’t selling, so it could offer the vehicles
as ordinary Cybertrucks.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24334954/tesla-cybertruck-sales-demand-expectation-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Verge</em></em></u></a> notes, how you’d grade the Cybertruck depends
entirely on what you believe its potential to be. As a competitor to EV
pickup trucks like the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Chevy
Silverado EV, the Tesla is the king — Cybertruck is outselling all those
models. But electric truck sales have been sluggish all along, making
the Cybertruck the big fish in a pretty small pond.
</p>
<p>
If the Cybertruck’s raison d’etre was simply to bring Musk’s Mad Max
daydream to life, then it has succeeded. But if the goal of the
Cybertruck was to sell lots of cars, then it’s hard to argue it has been
anything but a boondoggle.
</p>
<p>
The automakers nipping at Tesla’s heels in the EV market, including
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hsr449/gm_us_2024_ev_sales_114432_up_50/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM</u></a>
and
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/746147/kia-ev-sales-record-2024-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hyundai/Kia</u></a>,
have every reason to see a path to more growth, even with the lingering
uncertainty of an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>unfriendly
new era</u></a> of American government. They’re rolling out new models
and posting record sales. If they can continue to bring down the
starting price of their electric models, lots of their customers could
be ready to ditch fossil fuel engines.
</p>
<p>
But, at least for today, Tesla’s status it tethered to the Cybertruck,
which doesn’t have a lot of room to grow. Once upon a time, Tesla teased
a high-end version of the vehicle that would have
<a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/you-ordered-the-500-miles-cybertruck-and-they-launch-with-the-350-miles-what-do-you-do.8946/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>500
miles of range</u></a>, as well as an entry-level Cybertruck that could
start in the neighborhood of $50,000. Realizing either of those goals
could make many drivers — at least those not immediately turned off at
the thought of owning this thing — take a long look at the Cybertruck.
Neither appears imminent.
</p>
<p>
Musk’s reaction to all this might be a shrug. Rather than rounding out
his stable of cars with an affordable EV with the potential to sell in
huge numbers, he has bet the farm on Tesla winning the autonomous
vehicle race and tossed out the Cybertruck as a treat to his hardcore
devotees. Now he must hope enough of them buy it to keep Tesla’s
cratering stock price afloat while he chases the future.

id="us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-1">US
adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s
military</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington/New York — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it
has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader
Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work
with China’s military.  </p>
<p>The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies,
Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document
published on Monday.</p>
<p>The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally
mandated under U.S. law as the “Section 1260H list,” designated 134
companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.</p>
<p>U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese
instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading.
Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly
a mistake.” It added: “We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike
sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our
business.”</p>
<p>CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it “is not engaged in
any military related activities.”</p>
<p>A Quectel spokesperson said the company “does not work with the
military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its
designation, which clearly has been made in error.”</p>
<p>The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not
respond to requests or did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Amid strained relations between the world’s two biggest economies,
the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in
recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose
security risks.</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, said the additions showed that it was “reckless” for
American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese
corporations.</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,”
he said. “The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence
protecting them is being fortified. Today’s list lays bare that these
aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s
military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic
ambitions.”</p>
<p>Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic
sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have
alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies.
Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of
the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a
battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to
produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility - a move that
has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment
on Monday.</p>
<p>While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a
blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark
warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting
business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury
Department to sanction the companies.</p>
<p>Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker
Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous
designations, but remain on the updated list.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the
requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii
Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s no quick fix for decarbonizing medium- and long-distance
flights. Batteries are typically too heavy, and hydrogen fuel takes up
too much space to offer a practical solution, leaving sustainable
aviation fuels made from plants and other biomass, recycled carbon, or
captured carbon as the primary options. Traditionally, this fuel is much
more expensive — and the feedstocks for it much more scarce — than
conventional petroleum-based jet fuel. But companies are now racing to
overcome these barriers, as recent months have seen backers throw
hundreds of millions behind a series of emergent, but promising
solutions.
</p>
<p>
Today, most SAF is made of feedstocks such as used cooking oil and
animal fats, from companies such as
<a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/news/air-canada-sustainable-aviation-fuel-neste/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Neste</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-montana-renewables-significantly-expand-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Montana
Renewables</u></a>. But this supply is limited by, well, the amount of
cooking oil or fats restaurants and food processing facilities generate,
and is thus projected to meet only about 10% of total SAF demand by
2050, according to a
<a href="https://3stepsolutions.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/assets/custom/010856/downloads/Making-Net-Zero-Aviation-possible.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2022
report</u></a> by the Mission Possible Partnership. Beyond that,
companies would have to start growing new crops just to make into fuel.
</p>
<p>
That creates an opportunity for developers of second-generation SAF
technologies, which involve making jet fuel out of captured carbon or
alternate biomass sources, such as forest waste. These methods are not
yet mature enough to make a significant dent in 2030 targets, such as
the EU’s mandate to use 6% SAF and the U.S. government’s goal of
producing
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/sustainable-aviation-fuel-grand-challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3
billion gallons of SAF</u></a> per year domestically. But this tech will
<em><em>need</em></em> to be a big part of the equation in order to meet
the aviation sector’s overall goal of net zero emissions by 2050, as
well as the EU’s sustainable fuels mandate, which increases to 20% by
2035 and 70% by 2050 for all flights originating in the bloc.
</p>
<p>
“That’s going to be a massive jump because currently, SAF uptake is
about 0.2% of fuel,” Nicole Cerulli, a research associate for
transportation and logistics at the market research firm Cleantech
Group, told me. The head of the
<a href="https://www.iata.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>airline
industry’s trade association</u></a>, Willie Walsh,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-airlines-could-miss-sustainable-fuel-targets-iatas-walsh-says-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in December</u></a> at a media day event, “We’re not making as much
progress as we’d hoped for, and we’re certainly not making as much
progress as we need.” While global SAF production doubled to 1 million
metric tons in 2024, that fell far below the trade group’s projection of
1.5 million metric tons,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/crude-oil/120623-saf-production-to-triple-to-15-mil-mt-in-2024-but-progress-slow-iata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
at the end of 2023</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Producing SAF requires making hydrocarbons that mirror those used in
traditional jet fuel. We know how to do that, but the processes required
— electrolysis, gasification, and the series of chemical reactions known
as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis — are energy intensive. So finding a way to
power all of this sustainably while simultaneously scaling to meet
demand is a challenging and expensive task.
</p>
<p>
Aamir Shams, a senior associate at the energy think tank RMI whose work
focuses on driving demand for SAF, told me that while sustainable fuel
is undeniably more expensive than traditional fuel, airlines and
corporations have so far been willing to pay the premium. “We feel that
the lag is happening because we just don’t have the fuel today,” Shams
said. “Whatever fuel shows up, it just flies off the shelves.”
</p>
<p>
Twelve, a Washington-based SAF producer, thinks its e-fuels can help
make a dent. The company is looking to produce jet fuel initially by
recycling the CO2 emitted from the ethanol, pulp, and paper industries.
In September,
<a href="https://www.twelve.co/post/twelve-announces-645-million-in-funding-led-by-tpg-to-transform-co2-in-jet-fuel-and-e-chemicals-a-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
company raised $645 million</u></a> to complete the buildout of its
inaugural SAF facility in Washington state, support the development of
future plants, and pursue further R&amp;D. The funding includes $400
million in project equity from the impact fund TPG Rise Climate, $200
million in Series C financing led by TPG, Capricorn Investment Group,
and Pulse Fund, and $45 million in loans. The company has also
previously
<a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2819999/the-air-force-partners-with-twelve-proves-its-possible-to-make-jet-fuel-out-of/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>partnered
with the Air Force</u></a> to explore producing fuel on demand in hard
to reach areas.
</p>
<p>
Nicholas Flanders, Twelve’s CEO, told me that the company is starting
with ethanol, pulp, and paper because the CO2 emissions from these
facilities are relatively concentrated and thus cheaper to capture. And
unlike, say, coal power plants, these industries aren’t going anywhere
fast, making them a steady source of carbon. To turn the captured CO2
into sustainable fuel, the company needs just one more input — water.
Renewable-powered electrolyzers then break apart the CO2 and H2O into
their constituent parts, and the resulting carbon monoxide and hydrogen
are combined to create a syngas. That then gets put through a chemical
reaction known as “Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,” where the syngas reacts
with catalysts to form hydrocarbons, which are then processed into
sustainable jet fuel and ultimately blended with conventional fuel.
</p>
<p>
Twelve says its proprietary CO2 electrolyzer can break apart CO2 at much
lower temperatures than would typically be required for this molecule,
which simplifies the whole process, making it easier to ramp the
electrolyzers up and down to match the output of intermittent
renewables. (How does it do this? The company didn’t respond when I
asked.) Twelve’s first plant, which sources carbon from a nearby ethanol
facility, is set to come online next year, producing 50,000 gallons of
SAF annually once it’s fully scaled, with electrolyzers that will run on
hydropower.
</p>
<p>
While Europe may have stricter, actually enforceable SAF requirements
than the U.S., Flanders told me there’s a lot of promise in domestic
production. “I think the U.S. has an exciting combination of relatively
low-cost green electricity, lots of biogenic CO2 sources, a lot of
demand for the product we’re making, and then the inflation Reduction
Act and state level incentives can further enhance the economics.”
Currently, the IRA provides SAF producers with a baseline $1.25 tax
credit per gallon produced, which gradually increases the greener the
fuel gets. Of course, whether or not the next Congress will rescind this
is anybody’s guess.
</p>
<p>
Down the line, incentives and mandates will end up mattering a whole
lot. Making SAF simply costs a whole lot more than producing jet fuel
the standard way, by refining crude oil. But in the meantime, Twelve is
setting up cost-sharing partnerships between airlines that want to
reduce their direct emissions (scope 1) and large corporations that want
to reduce their indirect emissions (scope 3), which include employee
business travel.
</p>
<p>
For example, Twelve has offtake agreements with Seattle-based Alaska
Airlines and Microsoft for the fuel produced at its initial Washington
plant. Microsoft, which aims to reduce emissions from its employees’
flights, will essentially cover the cost premium associated with
Twelve’s more expensive SAF fuel, making it cost-effective for Alaska to
use in its fleet. Twelve has a similar agreement with Boston Consulting
Group and an unnamed airline
</p>
<p>
Eventually, Flanders told me, the company expects to source carbon via
direct air capture, but doing so today would be prohibitively expensive.
“If there were a customer who wanted to pay the additional amount to use
DAC today, we’d be very happy to do that,” Flanders said. “But our
perspective is it will maybe be another decade before that cost starts
to converge.”
</p>
<p>
No sustainable fuel is even close to cost parity yet — Cerulli told me
that it generally comes with a “roughly 250% to over 800%” cost premium
over conventional jet fuel. So while voluntary uptake by companies such
as Microsoft and BCG are helping drive the emergent market today, that
won’t be near enough to decarbonize the industry. “At the simplest
level, the cost of not using SAF has to be higher than using it,”
Cerulli told me.
</p>
<p>
Pathway Energy thinks that by incorporating carbon sequestration into
its process, it can help the world get there. The sustainable fuels
company, which
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carbon-negative-fuels-pioneer-pathway-energy-debuts-with-ultra-negative-sustainable-aviation-fuel-and-plans-for-new-saf-facility-on-us-gulf-coast-302329556.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emerged
from stealth</u></a> just last month, is pursuing what CEO Steve Roberts
told me is “probably the most cost-efficient long-term pathway from a
decarbonization perspective.” The company is building a $2 billion SAF
plant in Port Arthur, Texas designed to produce about 30 million gallons
of jet fuel annually — enough to power about 5,000 carbon-neutral
10-hour flights — while also permanently sequestering more than 1.9
million tons of CO2.
</p>
<p>
Pathway, a subsidiary of the investment and advisory firm Nexus
Holdings, has partnered with the UK-based renewable energy company Drax,
which will supply the company with 1 million metric tons of wood
pellets, to be turned into fuel using a series of well-established
technologies. The first step is to gasify the biomass by heating the
pellets to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen to produce a
syngas. Then, just as Twelve does, it puts the syngas through the
Fischer-Tropsch process to form the hydrocarbons that become SAF.
</p>
<p>
The competitive advantage here is capturing the emissions from the fuel
production process itself and storing them permanently underground.
Since Pathway is burying CO2 that’s already been captured by the trees
from which the wood pellets come, that would make Pathway’s SAF
carbon-negative, in theory, while the best Twelve and similar companies
can hope for is carbon neutrality, assuming all of their captured carbon
is used to produce fuel.
</p>
<p>
The choice of Drax as a feedstock partner is not without controversy,
however, as the BBC revealed that the company sources much of its wood
from
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rare
old-growth forests</u></a>. Though this is technically legal, it’s also
ecologically disruptive. Roberts told me Drax’s sourcing methodologies
have been verified by third parties, and Pathway isn’t concerned. “I
don’t think any of that controversy has yielded any actually significant
changes to their sourcing program at all, because we believe that
they’re compliant,” Roberts told me. “We are 100% certain that they’re
meeting all the standards and expectations.”
</p>
<p>
Pathway has big growth plans, which depend on the legitimacy of its
sustainability cred. Beyond the Port Arthur facility, which Roberts told
me will begin production by the end of 2029 or early 2030, the company
has a pipeline of additional facilities along the Gulf Coast in the
works. It also has global ambitions. “When you have a fuel that is this
negative, it really opens up a global market, because you can transport
fuel out of Texas, whether that be into the EU, Africa, Asia, wherever
it may be,” Roberts said, explaining that even substantial
transportation-related emissions would be offset by the
carbon-negativity of the fuel.
</p>
<p>
But alternative feedstocks such as forestry biomass are finite
resources, too. That’s why many experts think that within the SAF
sector, e-fuels such as Twelve’s that could one day source carbon via
direct air capture and then electrolyze it have the greatest potential
for growth. “It’s extremely dependent on getting sustainable CO2 and
cheap electricity prices so that you can make cheap green hydrogen,”
Shams told me. “But theoretically, it is unlimited in terms of what your
total cap on production would be.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, airlines are focused on making their planes and engines
more aerodynamic and efficient so that they don’t consume as much fuel
in the first place. They’re also exploring other technical pathways to
decarbonization — because after all, SAF will only be a portion of the
solution, as many short and medium-length flights could likely be
powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel.
<a href="https://saf.rmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RMI
forecasts</u></a> that by 2050, 45% of global emissions reduction in the
aviation sector will come from improvements in fuel efficiency, 37% will
be due to SAF deployment, 7% will come from hydrogen, and 3.5% will come
from electrification.
</p>
<p>
If you did the mental math, you’ll notice these numbers add up to 92.5%
— not 100%. “What we have done is, let’s look at what we are actually
doing today and for the past three, four, five years, and let’s see if
we get to net zero or not. And the answer is, no. We don’t get to net
zero by 2050,” Shams told me. And while getting to 92.5% is nothing to
scoff at, that means that the aviation sector would still be emitting
about 700 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by that time.
</p>
<p>
So what’s to be done? “The financing sector needs to step up its game
and take a little bit more of a risk than they are used to,” Shams told
me, noting that one of RMI’s partners, the
<a href="https://www.missionpossiblepartnership.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mission
Possible Partnership</u></a>, estimates that getting the aviation sector
to net zero will require an investment of around $170 billion per year,
a total of about $4.5 trillion by 2050. These numbers take a variety of
factors into account beyond strictly SAF production, such as airport
infrastructure for new fuels, building out direct air capture plants,
etc.
</p>
<p>
But any way you cut it, it’s a boatload of money that certainly puts
Pathway’s $2 billion SAF facility and Twelve’s $645 million funding
round in perspective. And it’s far from certain that we can get there.
“Increasingly, that goal of the 2050 net-zero target looks really
difficult to achieve,” Shams put it simply. “Commitments are always
going up, but more can be done.”

Americans love their public lands — particularly
<a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/stateoftherockies/_documents/2024-poll-data/2024%20Topic%20Report%20on%20Conservation%20and%20Public%20Lands%20in%20the%20West.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Americans
living in the West</u></a>, where easy access to the region’s
undeveloped forests, mountains, rivers, deserts, and lakes is a point of
identity and pride. But on Friday, in its first action as a voting body,
the House of Representatives for the 119th Congress approved
<a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241230/119PACKAGE3_xml.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
rules package</u></a> that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/03/house-gop-rules-change-would-make-it-easier-to-sell-off-federal-land/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reintroduces
a provision</u></a> making it easier for lawmakers to cede control of
federal lands to local authorities. That, in turn, could result in vast
swaths of the West being
<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/opinion/utah-lawsuit-public-land/#:~:text=those%20protections%20would%20vanish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opened
up to drilling</u></a> or auctioned off to private owners,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm" target="_self"><u>according
to critics</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“It’s an obscure provision that [Congress] is using to essentially
obfuscate the paving of the way towards selling off federal public
lands,” Michael Carroll, the BLM Campaign Director at the Wilderness
Society, told me of the rulemaking maneuver.
</p>
<p>
Republicans have tried this before. In 2017, during the party’s
trifecta, the House approved a rules package with a near-identical
provision that essentially declared that public lands do not have a
budgetary value that needs to be accounted for when they’re sold,
streamlining potential handovers. New Mexico Democratic Representative
Raúl Grijalva
<a href="https://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/media/press-releases/grijalva-pushes-back-on-gop-proposal-to-make-it-even-easier-to-give-away-americas-public-lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described
the provision at the time</u></a> as allowing Congress to “give away
every single piece of property we own, for free, and pretend we have
lost nothing of any value.”
</p>
<p>
Utah Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz subsequently attempted to
take advantage of the provision by introducing legislation that would
have transferred 3 million acres of Western federal land to state
control — a bill that was met by so much opposition from hunters,
anglers, and
<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/02/12/utahns-drown-out-chaffetz-with-demand-to-explain-yourself-at-tense-town-hall/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
own furious constituents</u></a> that he ultimately

it</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The provision briefly disappeared from the rules packages of the 116th
and 117th Congresses, when the House was controlled by Democrats, then
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/5/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reappeared
again</u></a> in 2023, when Congress was split but the House was in
Republican control. But to advocates for public lands, the provision’s
inclusion in the 119th Congress’ rules seems like a mere extension and
more like a tactical teeing-up for the incoming Republican trifecta.
“Utah politicians aren’t stupid. They learn from their mistakes,”
Carroll said.
</p>
<p>
He described an anticipated three-pronged approach to land privatization
headed into 2024: the judiciary route, with the Supreme Court poised to
decide whether or not to hear a Utah lawsuit over
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm#:~:text=Utah%20v.%20the%20United%20States" target="_self"><u>the
constitutionality of federal control of BLM lands</u></a> later
thisweek; the legislative route, which began with Friday’s rule package;
and the administrative route, with Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the
Interior
<a href="https://heatmap.news/tag/doug-burgum" target="_self"><u>Doug
Burgum</u></a>, who
<a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/12/16/trump-public-lands-opinion-zornio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supports
Utah’s lawsuit</u></a>, under a directive to increase drilling. “It’s
all backed up by the amount of money that the state of Utah appropriated
to support their lawsuit — $20 million that they didn’t have that last
time,” Carroll added.
</p>
<p>
He doesn’t expect Republicans to sit around twiddling their thumbs,
either. In 2017, the “Trump administration was pretty new to governing
and the levers of power.” He expects in 2024 “we’re going to see, in the
next two weeks, legislation that moves to privatize public lands.”
</p>
<p>
“We need to hear Republicans when they say, ‘Drill, baby drill,’”
Carroll went on. “That has real consequences for federal public lands.”

to visit New Orleans, relatives of victims of terrorist attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will
visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with relatives of the 14 people
who were killed and 35 injured there when a man drove a rented pickup
truck at high speed through a group of pedestrians in the early hours of
New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>The Bidens plan to meet with family members of the victims who were
run over when the suspect, identified by authorities as Shamsud-Din
Jabbar, a 42-year-old military veteran from Houston, sped down bustling
Bourbon Street, a prime tourist, restaurant and bar locale. Police
fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers.</p>
<p>“I’ve been there,” Biden told reporters Sunday ahead of his visit,
reflecting on the loss of his own family members through his years in
public life. “There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just
had such a tragic loss. My message is going to be personal if I get to
get them alone.”</p>
<p>Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi:</p>
<p>Biden, with two weeks remaining in office before President-elect
Donald Trump is inaugurated, is also meeting with investigators who say
that Jabbar acted alone in the attack but was inspired by the Islamic
State to carry out the terror attack.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Jabbar posted five
videos on social media expressing support for the Islamic State
terrorist group, or IS, over roughly an hour and a half before the
attack as New Orleans revelers celebrated the first hours of 2025. An IS
flag was found in the back of the truck.</p>
<p>An official with the country’s top criminal investigative agency said
Sunday that Jabbar, wearing specialized hands-free glasses, last October
twice visited the French Quarter neighborhood where the attack
occurred.</p>
<p>Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans Field
Office, Myrthil said video shows the suspect riding through the French
Quarter on a bicycle wearing “meta glasses” that are capable of
recording or livestreaming.</p>
<p>Myrthil also said officials are also investigating two foreign trips
Jabbar took, one to Cairo in the summer of 2023 and then to Canada a few
days later.</p>
<p>“Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he went with
and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here,” Myrthil
said.</p>
<p>FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters at a
news conference Saturday, “All investigative details and evidence that
we have now still support that Jabbar acted alone here in New Orleans.
We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States,
but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and
outside of our borders.”</p>
<p>Biden said investigators told him the suspect had a remote detonator
in his truck that was meant to set off two explosive devices placed
inside ice coolers along Bourbon Street. But police killed Jabbar before
he could detonate the explosives.</p>

US Steel file suit after Biden administration blocks $15 billion
deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Japan’s Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel are filing a federal
lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s decision to block a
proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based
U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the
companies’ due process.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel’s
aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon
Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United
States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government
approval.</p>
<p>Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal
regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong
domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential
national security priority. … Without domestic steel production and
domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure,” he
said in a statement.</p>
<p>While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to
Japan’s relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S.
president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm.</p>
<p>Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The president’s decision to block the deal comes after the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to
reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last
month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15
days to reach a final decision.</p>

in 11th hour action, bans new offshore oil and gas drilling in most
federal waters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is moving to ban new offshore oil
and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, a last-minute effort to
block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand
offshore drilling.</p>
<p>Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, said he is using authority
under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore
areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and
portions of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas
leasing.</p>
<p>“My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and
beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts
could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is
unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,” Biden said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the
country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the
time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,” he
said.</p>
<p>Biden’s orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico,
where most U.S. offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect
coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future
drilling.</p>
<p>Biden’s actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal
waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind,
since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. Trump
himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a
memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling
in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and
South Carolina until 2032.</p>
<p>The action came after Trump initially moved to vastly expand offshore
drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and
other coastal states.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American “energy
dominance” around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas
drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change.</p>
<p>Environmental advocates hailed Biden’s action, saying new oil and gas
drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest year in recorded
history.</p>
<p>“This is an epic ocean victory!” said Joseph Gordon, campaign
director for the environmental group Oceana.</p>
<p>Gordon thanked Biden “for listening to the voices from coastal
communities” that oppose drilling and “contributing to the bipartisan
tradition of protecting our coasts.”</p>
<p>Biden’s actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican
presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said,
adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans
and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a
clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries.</p>
<p>In balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was
clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show
“relatively minimal potential” that does not justify possible
environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new
leasing and drilling.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Trump mocked Biden, saying, “Joe Biden clearly
wants high gas prices to be his legacy.”</p>
<p>The spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, called Biden’s action “a
disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American
people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower
gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby,
drill.”</p>
<p>Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of
Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy
companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental
activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight
against climate change.</p>
<p>A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore
sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum
number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to
continue expanding offshore wind development.</p>
<p>Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at
least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas
leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind
leases.</p>
<p>Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in
Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has
previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the
Arctic Ocean.</p>

Oregon, and California, as well as parts of the Northern Bering Sea in
Alaska. As <em><em>Politico</em></em>

most of those areas are of little interest to the oil and gas industry,
but “the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico is believed to hold large
untapped reservoirs of oil.” It will be difficult for the incoming Trump
administration to dismantle Biden’s ban, but the fossil fuel industry is
likely to challenge it. With this decision, Biden will have conserved
more lands and waters than any other U.S. president, the White House
added. “President Biden has been a steadfast champion for climate
progress from Day One of his administration,” Margie Alt, director of
the Climate Action Campaign, said in a statement. “His legacy of

blast of snow, ice and bitter cold grips US from Midwest to East

<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A major winter blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures in
the U.S. stirred dangerous travel conditions from central and southern
states all the way to the East Coast early Monday, prompting schools and
government offices in several states to close.</p>
<p>Snow and ice blanketed major roads across Kansas, western Nebraska
and parts of Indiana, where the state’s National Guard was activated to
help stranded motorists. At least 20 centimeters of snow was expected,
along with gusting winds up to 72 kph.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from Kansas
and Missouri all the way to New Jersey.</p>
<p>“For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals,
it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,” the weather
service said.</p>
<p>Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at thick
ice coating his SUV in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri.
Wright said he will work remotely Monday, but wanted to scrape off his
vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He also is
seeking boots for their two older dogs that “won’t budge at all” when
their paws hit the cold ground.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North

classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for its nearly 100,000
students.</p>
<p>Classes also have been cancelled in Maryland, where Gov. Wes Moore
declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced the state government
would be closed Monday.</p>
<p>“Keeping Marylanders safe is our top priority. Please stay off the

<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the risk to
recent progress on climate policy was immediately obvious: He ran on a
promise to increase fossil fuel production, has a long history of
denigrating renewable energy, and is hostile to anything with Joe
Biden’s name on it, including a raft of policies enacted over the past
four years to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
But as unique a character as Trump is, his victory was just one part of
an international surge in right-wing populism that has occurred over the
past few years, especially in Europe. Right-wing populists focus their
appeals on a supposed conflict between ordinary people and what they
claim is a corrupt elite; the philosophy is also usually characterized
by nativism and a suspicion of international cooperation and
integration. All of that comfortably translates into antagonism toward
climate action. So if right-wing populists are on the march globally,
what are the risks for global climate policy?

<p>
The picture is complex — not every populist party puts environmental
issues near the center of its agenda. The Alternative for Germany party
(also known as AfD) recently gained a high-profile supporter when Elon
Musk
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-musk-far-right-afd-welt-915cc6821cd48c3168a7895b1d1c1a35" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
an op-ed</u></a> calling it “the last spark of hope” for Germany, citing
“cultural integrity” as one of the reasons he supports it. But it was
already gaining, even if most Germans find it repellent: In September,
it
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>became</u></a>
the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II.
</p>
<p>
The AfD’s platform (which it has helpfully
<a href="https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-04-12_afd-grundsatzprogramm-englisch_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>translated
into English</u></a>) is as full-on denialist as you can find from any
major political party; it rejects the idea of anthropogenic climate
change and demands an end to German efforts to reduce emissions. “We
want to end the perception of CO2 as an exclusively harmful substance
and set a stop to Germany’s maverick policy in the reduction of CO2
emissions,” it says.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ PVV is now the
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1r0xvn0z5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largest
party</u></a> in the governing coalition (though after six months of
negotiations following the PVV’s showing in the last election, Wilders
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qvqwq0gxlo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agreed</u></a>
to let another coalition partner become prime minister). Its platform
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-dutch-election-result-spells-trouble-for-europes-climate-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a>
that the Dutch “Climate Act, the [Paris] climate accord and all other
climate measures go straight into the shredder.” Austria’s far-right FPO
party
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/austria-election-results-far-right-fpo-wins-rcna173160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>placed
first</u></a> in elections in September; it opposes most efforts to
combat climate change. (Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer, from the
center-right OVP or “People’s Party,”
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank">resigned
Saturday</a> after coalition talks with FPO broke down.)
</p>
<p>
In last summer’s parliamentary elections in France, the far-right
National Rally pledged a rollback of environmental laws,
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-france-risks-paralyzing-eu-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a>
“slashing the value-added tax on gas, power and fuel from 20 percent to
5.5 percent; freezing all new wind projects; and easing energy
efficiency requirements for homeowners looking to sell their
properties,” according to <em><em>Politico</em></em>. The party
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/france-election-runoff-results-07-07-24-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failed</u></a>
to win a plurality in the second round of voting, but it displayed a
strength that
<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2024/06/15/french-environmentalists-alarmed-by-the-potential-rise-of-far-right-to-power_6674876_114.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>alarmed</u></a>
many environmentalists. And after last year’s European Parliament
elections, far-right parties
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-parliament-election-far-right-b9339cf1a7d2067bf6fa1941c166936d#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
control</u></a> a quarter of the seats in the body, more than ever
before.
</p>
<p>
For these parties, the single most important issue is immigration; their
appeal is driven by backlash to influxes of newcomers from Syria and
northern African countries, which has contributed to a changing
demographic picture. But while environmental policies may be secondary,
the issues are hardly unrelated. Versions of “Great Replacement” theory
are visible everywhere, the idea that liberal elites are importing
non-white immigrants to displace native-born whites and transform the
nation. In this telling, green policy is one more way the conspiracy of
cultural elites tries to control the lives of the nation’s truest
citizens.
</p>
<p>
Far-right parties often get their strongest support in rural areas,
<a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/02/28/how-to-end-republican-exploitation-of-rural-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just
as Republicans do</u></a> in the U.S., where farmers
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/french-farmers-protests-paris-tractors-67c34b632b6a868e2c1b6cebe02b3cbd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>protest</u></a>
environmental policies imposed from urban capitals and which they see as
the brainchildren of cosmopolitan elites who are either indifferent or
actively hostile to their needs. Last spring, farmers
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/europe/europe-farmers-protests-explainer-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staged</u></a>
dramatic protests in France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries,
protesting environmental policies they said made it difficult for them
to earn a living.
</p>
<p>
In that way, opposition to climate action
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000443" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fits</u></a>
neatly within the rest of the right-wing populist philosophy and agenda,
which usually reject international accords like the Paris Agreement and
even the existence of the European Union itself. Repealing climate laws
can be a way of striking back at experts and cosmopolitan urbanites,
whether it’s Trump rolling back EV subsidies or European rightists
attacking the EU’s
<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green
Deal</u></a>, which among other things
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/europe/eu-climate-change-law-net-zero-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>obligates</u></a>
the continent to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The far-right populist parties aren’t the only ones pushing back certain
kinds of climate action; center-right parties are also playing a part,
even if historically they have been far more progressive on climate than
the GOP. Consider the European Union’s law requiring that no
internal-combustion cars be produced after 2035, which
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-the-eu-ditched-the-combustion-engine-zero-emissions-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a>
in 2022. That law is now under attack from the center-right, especially
the European People’s Party, the largest bloc in the European
Parliament. The EPP (which includes EU president Ursula von der Leyen
among its members) is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-largest-political-group-pushes-weaken-combustion-engine-ban-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking</u></a>
to have the ban repealed, or at least modified to allow for continued
production of plug-in hybrids and ICE cars that run on biofuels.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, far-right parties that want to maximize their power to the
point where they can lead governing coalitions have an incentive to
moderate their rhetoric on climate. One can see that dynamic in Italian
prime minister Georgia Meloni, whose rhetoric on the international stage
sounds much more progressive than her party does
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bgiorgia-meloni-italy-heat-summer-wildfires-climate-change-climate-denial/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
home</u></a>, where it still traffics in climate denial. She has even
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-giorgia-meloni-climate-change-right-wing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presented</u></a>
climate as a right-wing issue, saying “The right loves the environment
because it loves the land, the identity, the homeland.”
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-right-wing-show-donald-trump-climate-maga-style-cop29-azerbaijan-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-nuclear-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
version</u></a> of environmentalism seeks to combat climate change in
order to minimize the numbers of future climate migrants from the Global
South, many of whom will wind up seeking refuge in Europe.
</p>
<p>
However you feel about that motivation, it points to a vicious cycle
that could emerge in the future: As global temperatures increase and
natural disasters become more frequent, more places become uninhabitable
and millions of people become climate refugees. They head north into
developed countries, where their presence spurs a right-wing backlash
that puts far-right populist parties into power. Those parties then
reverse progressive climate policies, making it more difficult to reduce
emissions and continuing the cycle.
</p>
<p>
That might not be our future, and the changes to climate policy
advocated by the resurgent populist parties haven’t yet been
implemented. It’s also possible that the far right’s political moment
could be fleeting. But the next few years will offer plenty of reasons
to worry.

id="jimmy-carter-raised-climate-change-concerns-35-years-before-the-paris-accords">Jimmy
Carter raised climate change concerns 35 years before the Paris
Accords</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PLAINS, GEORGIA — When Jimmy Carter chose branding designs for his
presidential campaign, he passed on the usual red, white and blue. He
wanted green.</p>
<p>Emphasizing how much the Georgia Democrat enjoyed nature and
prioritized environmental policy, the color became ubiquitous. On
buttons, bumper stickers, brochures, the sign rechristening the old
Plains train depot as his campaign headquarters. Even the hometown
Election Night party.</p>
<p>“The minute it was announced, we all had the shirts to put on — and
they were green, too,” said LeAnne Smith, Carter’s niece, recalling the
1976 victory celebration.</p>
<p>Nearly a half-century later, environmental advocates are remembering
Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, as a president who
elevated environmental stewardship, energy conservation and discussions
about the global threat of rising carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to abandon the renewable
energy investments that President Joe Biden included in the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022, echoing how President Ronald Reagan dismantled
the solar panels Carter installed on the White House roof. But politics
aside, the scientific consensus has settled where Carter stood two
generations earlier.</p>
<p>“President Carter was four decades ahead of his time,” said Manish
Bapna, who leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carter called
for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions well before “climate change” was
part of the American lexicon, he said.</p>
<p>Wearing cardigans and setting standards</p>
<p>Former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate advocacy earned him the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize, called Carter “a lifelong role model for the
entire environmental movement.”</p>
<p>As president, Carter implemented the first U.S. efficiency standards
for passenger vehicles and household appliances. He created the U.S.
Department of Energy, which streamlined energy research, and more than
doubled the wilderness area under National Park Service protection.</p>
<p>Inviting ridicule, Carter asked Americans to conserve energy through
personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down thermostats
in winter amid global fuel shortages. He pushed renewable energy to
lessen dependence on fossil fuels, calling for 20% of U.S. energy to
come from alternative sources by 2000.</p>
<p>But laments linger about what 39th president could not get done or
did not try before his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Addressing climate change</p>
<p>Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a West Wing report
linking fossil fuels to rising carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s
atmosphere. Carter’s top environmental advisers urged “immediate”
cutbacks on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce what scientists at the
time called “carbon dioxide pollution.”</p>
<p>“Nobody anywhere in the world in a high government position was
talking about this problem” before Carter, biographer Jonathan Alter
said.</p>
<p>The White House released the findings, which drew forgettable news
coverage: The New York Times published its story on the 13th page of its
front section. And with scant time left in office, there were no
tangible moves Carter could make, beyond the energy legislation he had
already signed.</p>
<p>The report recommended limiting global average temperatures to 2
degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.
Thirty-five years later, in the 2015 Paris climate accords,
participating nations set a similar goal.</p>
<p>“If he had been reelected, it’s fair to say that we would have been
beginning to address climate change in the early 1980s,” Alter told the
AP. “When you think about that, it adds a kind of a tragic dimension,
almost, to his political defeat.”</p>
<p>Reagan ended high-level conversations about carbon emissions. He
opposed efficiency standards as government overreach and rolled back
some regulations. His chief of staff, Don Regan, called the solar panels
“a joke.”</p>
<p>Pursuing energy independence</p>
<p>Despite Carter’s emphasis on renewable sources, the fossil fuel
industry benefited from his push toward U.S. energy independence.</p>
<p>Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Foundation, pointed to
coal-fired power plants built during and shortly thereafter Carter’s
term, and his deregulation of natural gas production, a move O’Mara
called “a precursor” to widespread fracking. Bapna noted Carter backed
drilling off the coasts of Long Island in New York and New England.</p>
<p>Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy, pointed to Carter’s Synthetic Fuels
Corporation, a short-lived effort to produce fossil fuel alternatives
that “would have meant much higher carbon emissions.”</p>
<p>But Carter had the right priorities, especially on research and
development coordinated through the Energy Department, Nadel said. “He
allowed us to have a national approach rather than one agency here and
another there.”</p>
<p>Stewarding God’s creation</p>
<p>Carter’s environmental interests had deep roots going back to a a
rural boyhood filled with hunting and fishing and working his father’s
farmland.</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter was an environmentalist before it was a real part of
the political discussion — and I’m not talking about solar panels on the
White House,” said Dubose Porter, a longtime Georgia Democratic Party
leader. “Just focusing on that, misses how early and how committed he
was.”</p>
<p>His early years as a youth, influenced Carter as governor, Porter
said, when he boosted Georgia’s state parks system and opposed Georgia
congressmen who wanted to dam a river. Carter paddled the waterway
himself and decided its natural state trumped the lucrative federal
construction proposal.</p>
<p>In Washington, Carter continued sometimes unwinnable fights against
funding for projects he deemed damaging and unnecessary. He found more
success extending federal protection for more than 60.7 million
hectares, including redwood forests in California and vast swaths of
Alaska.</p>
<p>Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College professor who has written on
Carter’s faith, said he saw himself as a custodian of divinely granted
natural resources.</p>
<p>“That’s a real connection that young evangelicals still have with him
today,” Balmer said.</p>
<p>Condemning consumerism</p>
<p>Carter won the presidency amid energy shortages rooted in global
strife, especially in the oil-rich Middle East, so national security and
economic interests dovetailed with Carter’s religious beliefs and
affinity for nature, Nadel noted.</p>
<p>Carter compared the energy crisis to “the moral equivalent of war,”
and as inflation and gas lines grew, he called for individual sacrifice
and sweeping action on renewable energy.</p>
<p>“Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what
one owns,” Carter warned in 1979. “But we’ve discovered that owning
things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for
meaning.”</p>
<p>That “malaise” speech — dubbed so by the media despite Carter not
using the word — was unique in presidential politics for its
condemnation of unchecked American consumerism. Carter celebrated that
more than 100 million Americans watched. By 2010, Carter acknowledged in
his annotated “White House Diary” that his speech was a flop, but said
it proved to be prescient for advocating bold and direct action on
energy.</p>
<p>“You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today,”
said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 2020 presidential run focused on
climate action. “I’ve learned in politics that timing is everything and
serendipity is everything.”</p>

arrive in the Philippines to complete visa processing for resettlement
in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, Philippines — A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the
Philippines on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their
resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between
Manila and Washington.</p>
<p>The Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant
visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring
to resettle in America.</p>
<p>Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the
Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided
entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and
undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals’
stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security,
medical and transportation expenses, she said.</p>
<p>She didn’t specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa
processing will take. Under the Philippines’ rules, visa applicants can
stay for no longer than 59 days.</p>
<p>A senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that
only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines
under the “one-time” deal. The official who had knowledge of the
negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack
of authority to speak publicly.</p>
<p>The Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the
U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special
immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the
country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in
2021.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to
his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed
the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited
the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said.</p>
<p>Marcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the
presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year,
he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014
defense agreement in a decision that upset China.</p>

<h2 id="us-congress-to-certify-trumps-election-win">US Congress to
certify Trump’s election win</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress is set to meet Monday to certify Donald Trump’s
presidential election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The vice president is in charge of presiding over the count of
results from each of the country’s 50 states, putting Harris in the
position of certifying her own loss.</p>
<p>The procedure was long a formality in the election process, but four
years ago turned to chaos as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol,
injuring about 140 police officers, vandalizing the building and sending
lawmakers rushing for safety.</p>
<p>Similar scenes are not expected Monday, with Harris having conceded
defeat and President Joe Biden highlighting the need for a peaceful
process.</p>
<p>Authorities have prepared just in case, erecting tall metal barriers
around the Capitol complex.</p>
<p>Speaking Sunday at the White House, Biden called what happened on
Jan. 6, 2021 “one of the toughest days in American history.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,” Biden
said. </p>
<p>He added that Trump’s conduct four years ago, which included repeated
false claims that he won the election, “was a genuine threat to
democracy.”</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now,” Biden said.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with storming
the Capitol.  Trump has pledged to quickly issue pardons after he takes
office on Jan. 20.</p>

<h2 id="the-brutalist-emilia-perez-triumph-at-golden-globes">‘The
Brutalist,’ ‘Emilia Perez’ triumph at Golden Globes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet’s 215-minute postwar epic
“The Brutalist” and Jacques Audiard’s Spanish language, genre-shifting
trans musical “Emilia Perez” — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes
on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of
scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But
the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that
sought to be unlike anything else.</p>
<p>“The Brutalist” was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s
most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy
Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission,
also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody.</p>
<p>“I was told that this film was un-distributable,” said Corbet. “No
one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century
designer in 70mm. But it works.”</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez” won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar
chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting
actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song (“El Mal”) and best non-English
language film. Karla Sofia Gascon, the film’s transgender star who plays
a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, spoke for
the film.</p>
<p>“The light always wins over darkness,” said Gascon, gesturing to her
brightly orange dress. “You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us
up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.”</p>
<p>“I am who I am. Not who you want.”</p>
<p>The night’s big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker
was Moore’s win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback
performance in “The Substance,” about a Hollywood star who resorts to an
experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore
her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey
Madison of “Anora.”</p>
<p>“I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like
over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,”
said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991
for “Ghost.” “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a
popcorn actress.”</p>
<p>Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian
actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in “I’m Still Here,” a
based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the
disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de
Janeiro.</p>
<p>Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan
for another movie about physical transformation: “A Different Man,” in
which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who’s healed. Stan, who was
also nominated for playing Donald Trump in “The Apprentice,” noted that
both films were hard to get made.</p>
<p>“These are tough subject matters but these films are real and they’re
necessary,” said Stan. “But we can’t be afraid and look away.”</p>
<p>Glaser lightly roasts the Globes</p>
<p>Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: “I’m not
here to roast you.”</p>
<p>But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast
of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in
Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an
opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs
beforehand.</p>
<p>While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels
of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement
over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year’s Globes, following a diversity
and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted.
Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more
years.</p>
<p>Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump,
Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of
Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>“You could really do anything … except tell the country who to vote
for,” said Glaser. “But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time … if there is
one. I’m scared.”</p>
<p>The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and
Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now
defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics
scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than
a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge
Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded.</p>
<p>A win for ‘Wicked’</p>
<p>The Globes’ award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to
Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked,” which has nearly collected $700 million in
theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, “Wicked” is easily the
biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the
award, Chu argued for “a radical act of optimism” in art.</p>
<p>Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran
Culkin is emerging as the clear favorite for best supporting actor.
Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real
Pain,” his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO
series “Succession.” He called the Globes “basically the best date night
that my wife and I ever have,” and then thanked her for “putting up what
you call my mania.”</p>
<p>The papal thriller “Conclave” took best screenplay, for Peter
Straughan’s script. “Flow,” the wordless Latvian animated parable about
a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio
blockbusters like “Inside Out 2” and “The Wild Robot.” Trent Reznor and
Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for
“Challengers.”</p>
<p>TV prizes</p>
<p>Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy
champ “Shogun.” It won four awards, including best drama series and
acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other
repeat winners were: “Hacks” (best comedy series, actress for Jean
Smart), “The Bear” (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and “Baby
Reindeer” (best limited series).</p>
<p>Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for “True
Detective” and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in “The
Penguin.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s prosthetics from here on out,” said Farrell.</p>

<h2 id="sunday-school-class-with-jimmy-carter-what-it-was-like">Sunday
school class with Jimmy Carter: What it was like</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Plains, Georgia — It never got old. </p>
<p>No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at
Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned
from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter. </p>
<p>This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of
steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes
when he wasn’t building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair
elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases. </p>
<p>For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers,
Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path
destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed
connected with his fellow citizens of the world. </p>
<p>Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its
one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was
rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest
office in the land. </p>
<p>Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to
accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the
other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of
visitors usually attended services). </p>
<p>Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his
wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn.
And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome. </p>
<p>Sundays with Mr. Jimmy </p>
<p>Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a
bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a
strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan — Jan Williams, a
longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made
quite a drill sergeant. </p>
<p>It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules
you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics
and approached all things with an engineer’s orderly mind. </p>
<p>Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters — and
nearly everyone did — you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church
service. Picture-taking began around noon. </p>
<p>If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back.
If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No
attempts at conversation beyond a brief “good morning” or “thank
you.” </p>
<p>Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would
start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight
face if there were any visitors — that always got a laugh — and where
they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I’m sure I heard all 50
states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries. </p>
<p>If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. “I
used to live there,” the one-term president would say, breaking into
that toothy grin. </p>
<p>Carter’s Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life,
loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely
successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about
what he’d been up to or his perspective on world affairs. </p>
<p>Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or
bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work
with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to
go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter
Center’s successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long
friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. </p>
<p>“Willie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the
White House,” Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson’s
affection for weed. </p>
<p>“I don’t know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed.
I’ve heard rumors,” the former president said, with a sly grin and a
wink that suggested he believed every word. </p>
<p>My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had
long used encyclopedias for research. </p>
<p>Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he
boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring
someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he
got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore. </p>
<p>I recall the punchline. “How do I look up things now?” asked the man
born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: “Google.” </p>
<p>Memories of visits </p>
<p>During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes
without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional
glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more
and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about
the ravages of aging. </p>
<p>He resisted church members’ pleadings to take a seat while teaching.
I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018. </p>
<p>“I’m uncomfortable sitting down,” he said, “but I guess I’ll get used
to it.” </p>
<p>Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He
stood at the table for the rest of class. </p>
<p>Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white,
remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard — voilà — a flick of a
switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those
sitting in the back. </p>
<p>If there wasn’t enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs
were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms.
Carter’s lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main
room. </p>
<p>A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had
its benefits. </p>
<p>Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his
10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the
sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn’t happen in
front of the big crowd. </p>
<p>After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters
having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey’s house,
which included one glass each of “bargain-brand Chardonnay,” I asked
Carter how many glasses of wine he’d had the night before. </p>
<p>“I’ll say one,” Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing
behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers. </p>
<p>No matter where you sat — main sanctuary or back room — everyone got
their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this
seemed the biggest reward. </p>
<p>When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a
tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015,
Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary.
Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those
pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands. </p>
<p>“I’ll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,” he
quipped after one of his final lessons. “Actually, since I’m in church,
I better say I’ll be willing to have photographs made with all of
you.” </p>
<p>For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with
Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they
are. </p>
<p>The final lesson </p>
<p>Turnout for Carter’s Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great
Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with
some folks lining up outside the church the night before. </p>
<p>Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges
began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left
him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would
not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend.
Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation. </p>
<p>But Mr. Jimmy wasn’t done just yet. </p>
<p>The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear
that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter’s lesson that
day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in
retrospect. </p>
<p>“I’m going to start by asking you a very profound question,” he said.
“How many of you believe in life after death?” </p>
<p>Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to
being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the
end on this world came, he would be ready. </p>
<p>“We don’t have anything to dread after death,” Carter said with a
reassuring smile. </p>
<p>At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed
for a stranger. “I’m going to hold you to it,” Carter promised. </p>
<p>He never got the chance. </p>
<p>His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas
season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. </p>
<p>By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy’s treasured role as
spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his
presidency, was over.</p>

id="tiktok-creators-in-us-left-in-limbo-while-awaiting-decision-on-potential-platform-ban">TikTok
creators in US left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential
platform ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Will TikTok in the U.S. be banned this month?</p>
<p>That’s the pressing question keeping creators and small business
owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their
livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring
TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance,
or face a U.S. ban.</p>
<p>At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First
Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The
U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk,
says it does not.</p>
<p>For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since
President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through
executive order during his first term. But despite Trump’s recent
statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect
of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court
serving as the final arbiter.</p>
<p>If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it
would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators
scrambling to redefine their futures.</p>
<p>“A lot of my other creative friends, we’re all like freaking out. But
I’m staying calm,” said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from
TikTok’s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators
generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original
content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her
TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera
lens and editing software for her short films “Gambit” and “Awaken! My
Neighbor.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is “hard to accept.”</p>
<p>Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations,
grappling with the possibility that the platform they’ve invested so
much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted,
and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who
mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers
and incomes around their content.</p>
<p>For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to
continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she
knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli,
the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said
the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since
news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years,
and then died down.</p>
<p>“I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,” said
Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But
the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if
at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on
the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written
by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment
implications of a TikTok ban “sweeping and troubling” and said he wants
a “negotiated resolution” to the issue, something the Biden
administration had pursued to no avail.</p>
<p>While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are
exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business,
encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are
investing more time producing non-TikTok content.</p>
<p>Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring
alternative opportunities. While she hasn’t found a place quite like
TikTok, she’s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such
as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit
financially if TikTok vanishes.</p>
<p>According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator
economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480
billion by 2027.</p>
<p>Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of
platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their
social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the
platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they
did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and
provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other
marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note
creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning
platform, until something actually happens.</p>
<p>“I’m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,” said
Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from
obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.</p>
<p>A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants,
said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he’d struggled to gain on
Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok,
which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has
thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his
husband and mom.</p>
<p>“For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,” Hurst
said.</p>
<p>Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has
advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal
portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on
the platform, said Edward East, the agency’s founder and group CEO. This
can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus, it can
serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for
product advertisements, East said.</p>
<p>But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators
should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million
monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching
audiences.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them
to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to
stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who
doesn’t have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it.
TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which
will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app
“unworkable,” the Justice Department has said.</p>
<p>TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown
would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily
users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will
cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine
whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three
weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.</p>

id="central-us-pummeled-by-snow-ice-as-major-storm-heads-east">Central
US pummeled by snow, ice as major storm heads east</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Dangerous wintry conditions descended Sunday on a large
swath of the central United States as a severe storm system tracked
eastward, prompting travel and work disruptions from Kansas City to
Washington.</p>
<p>Around a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey were under winter
storm warnings Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather
Service (NWS), while areas across the U.S. South faced possible tornado
and cold weather threats.</p>
<p>Nationwide, over 60 million people were under some sort of weather
alert, according to broadcaster CNN, while air traffic monitoring site
FlightAware showed almost 2,200 flight cancellations and over 25,000
delays.</p>
<p>Gusty winds from the storm system, the first of the year, brought
blizzard conditions to Kansas and Missouri, while states farther east
were blanketed in multiple inches of snow.</p>
<p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear implored residents to “please stay
home” after reporting multiple vehicle crashes had closed a major
highway.</p>
<p>The NWS also warned that accumulations of up to a half inch of ice in
some areas — as well as widespread tree damage from powerful wind gusts
— could lead to “prolonged power outages.”</p>
<p>A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow began hitting Kansas early
Sunday morning. Storm chaser Brian Emfinger said on X that roads around
Kansas City were “a skating rink.”</p>
<p>Video posted by the Weather Channel showed cars skidding off
ice-coated highways and tractor trailers jack-knifing in Kansas, where
some areas were expecting more than 30 centimeters of snow.</p>
<p>“Areas of heavy snow will spread eastward through the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians tonight, reaching the northern Mid-Atlantic by
Monday morning,” the NWS said in an update.</p>
<p>Areas around Washington could see up to 25 centimeters overnight from
Sunday into Monday, making “hazardous travel and closings” likely, The
Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>That could complicate the task of U.S. lawmakers, who by
constitutional mandate must meet on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to certify
the winner of last year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“Whether we’re in a blizzard or not,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said
on Fox News Sunday, “we cannot delay that certification… I hope we have
full attendance.”</p>
<p>A joint session is to convene at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>Bitter cold</p>
<p>With the jet stream diving southward, temperatures are expected to
plunge, in some places to minus 18 degrees Celsius, while strong wind
gusts compound the dangers.</p>
<p>The mercury could sink tens of degrees below seasonal norms down to
the U.S. Gulf Coast. Before then, severe thunderstorms are expected
across the lower Mississippi Valley, the NWS forecast.</p>
<p>Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet. A thick coating of
ice could make travel hazardous, bring down trees and topple electricity
lines.</p>
<p>The NWS predicted more than 1 centimeter of freezing rain over parts
of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley area, and warned that
“long-lasting power outages” could leave millions of customers without
power from Kansas to the central Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Conditions could prove especially perilous in Appalachia, where a
deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged
multiple southeastern states including Kentucky.</p>
<p>The new storm “will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous
conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just
24 hours or so before it’s going to get really cold in Kentucky,”
Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>The governors of Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia have declared a
state of emergency in their states, and have taken to social media to
warn residents to stay home.</p>

Davis, Ted Danson celebrated in film and TV at Golden Globes event</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beverly Hills, California — Viola Davis’ journey to becoming one of
Hollywood’s most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra:
Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new
characters while honing her skills.</p>
<p>Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the
prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of
Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent
upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial
necessity often influenced her choice of roles.</p>
<p>“If I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I
wouldn’t be standing up here,” said Davis, who along with Ted Danson,
recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career
achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie
gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the
82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.</p>
<p>Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane
Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth
“Babyface” Edmonds. It’s the first time the Globes hosted a separate
event dedicated to both awards.</p>
<p>Davis said she couldn’t afford to wait for the perfect role,
especially as a “dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big
lips.”</p>
<p>“So I took it for the money,” said Davis, who won praise for a string
of compelling characters in films such as “Fences,” “The Woman King,”
“The Help” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” while captivating TV audiences
through the legal thriller drama “How to Get Away with Murder.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,” she
said. “I don’t think there’s any nobility in poverty.”</p>
<p>Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure
artist who “delivers the truth every time.” Both actors worked together
in the 2008 film “Doubt,” where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who
she called her “favorite actor in the world.”</p>
<p>The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood’s greatest talents.
Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan
Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.</p>
<p>When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her
an “amazing actor.”</p>
<p>“It’s such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,” said Danson,
a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke
out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC’s comedy “Cheers.” His other
credits include “The Good Place,” “Mr. Mayor,” “Fargo,” “CSI” and “CSI:
Cyber,” “Damages” and “Becker.”</p>
<p>Danson currently stars in Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside,” which
earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.</p>
<p>“Bia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: ‘Ted sets the
tone,’” said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with
the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients
include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was
Burnett herself.</p>
<p>Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including
“Pontiac Moon,” “Gulliver’s Travels” and “It Must Be Love.”</p>
<p>“He’s so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are
hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set
that is dictated by his kindness,” Steenburgen said. “As his wife,
watching the respect and love … for Ted, it made me very proud.”</p>
<p>Danson traded “I love you” with Burnett, showing admiration for each
other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with
the “Cheers” co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by
showing up to the event.</p>
<p>“I feel so grateful,” he said. “I’m truly the luckiest… on
Earth.”</p>
<p>Davis quipped, “Little Viola is squealing,” referring to how her
younger self would be overjoyed at the actor’s journey from an
impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom.</p>
<p>“She’s standing behind me and she’s pulling on my dress,” said Davis,
who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio
book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir
“Finding Me.”</p>
<p>“She’s wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine
because they her feel ‘purty’” she continued. “What she’s whispering is:
‘I told you I was a magician.’”</p>

id="driving-into-manhattan-itll-cost-you-new-congestion-toll-starts-sunday">Driving
into Manhattan? It’ll cost you; new congestion toll starts Sunday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of
Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the
busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. </p>
<p>The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic
gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix
its ailing public transit infrastructure. </p>
<p>Drivers of most passenger cars will pay $9 to enter Manhattan south
of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends
between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for
most vehicles. </p>
<p>After years of studies, delays and a last-ditch bid by New Jersey to
halt the toll, the program launched without major hiccups early Sunday.
But transit officials cautioned the first-in-the-nation scheme could
require adjustments — and likely would not get its first true test until
the workweek. </p>
<p>“This is a toll system that has never been tried before in terms of
complexity,” Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno
Lieber said at a news conference held at Grand Central Terminal Sunday.
“We don’t expect New Yorkers to overnight change their behavior.
Everybody’s going to have to adjust to this.” </p>
<p>The fee — which varies for motorcyclists, truck drivers and
ride-share apps — will be collected by electronic toll collection
systems at over 100 detection sites now scattered across the lower half
of Manhattan. </p>
<p>It comes on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and
tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a
credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan
via certain tunnels during peak hours. </p>
<p>On Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved
briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street
and 2nd Avenue. Many motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated
cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would
soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes. </p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” said Chris Smith, a realtor from Somerville,
New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras,
circumventing the charge. “Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should
be arrested for being ignorant.” </p>
<p>Some residents and transit riders, meanwhile, said they were hopeful
the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking in their
neighborhoods, while helping to modernize the subway system. </p>
<p>“I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of
traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,”
said Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan, describing
the constant din of traffic in his neighborhood as “pretty brutal.” </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the
program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow
through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a
federal environmental review. </p>
<p>In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone,
said congestion pricing “will put New York City at a disadvantage over
competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.” </p>
<p>Lieber, the MTA head, said he was not overly concerned that the
president-elect would succeed in unwinding the program, even if he did
follow through. “I think he understands living on 59th and 5th Avenue
what traffic is doing to our city,” Lieber said Sunday. </p>
<p>Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm,
have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S.
Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when
first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt benefits like
faster bus speeds and less traffic. </p>
<p>In New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a
plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system. </p>
<p>“With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their
funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,” said
Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he
waited for a subway Sunday morning in Lower Manhattan. “I don’t know if
I necessarily believe it until I really see something.” </p>
<p>The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge,
but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the
2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the
city — the epicenter of opposition to the program — were considered to
be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress. </p>
<p>Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan at the lower $9
toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original
$15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the
program before halting it. </p>
<p>Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block
the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey
to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. New Jersey
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has vowed to continue fighting against the
scheme. </p>
<p>In response, Lieber described the New Jersey governor’s views as the
“definition of hypocrisy,” adding that he expected the state to adjust
its strategy after “losing again and again and again” in court.</p>

and ‘Sonic 3’ rule first box office weekend of 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” claimed the No. 1 spot on the North
American box office charts over the first weekend of 2025.</p>
<p>The photorealistic “Lion King” prequel earned $23.8 million in its
third weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Paramount’s “Sonic
the Hedgehog 3,” which has dominated the past two weekends, wasn’t far
behind.</p>
<p>“Sonic 3” stayed close with a 3-day estimate of $21.2 million,
bringing its total domestic earnings to $187.5 million and helping the
overall franchise cross $1 billion worldwide. “Mufasa’s” running total
is slightly less, with $169.2 million.</p>
<p>In third place, Focus Features’ “Nosferatu” remake defied the fate of
so many of its genre predecessors and fell only 39% in its second
weekend. Horror films typically fall sharply after the first weekend and
anything less than a 50% decline is notable.</p>
<p>“Nosferatu,” which added 140 screens, claimed $13.2 million in ticket
sales, bringing its running total to $69.4 million since its Christmas
debut. The film, directed by Robert Eggers, already surpassed its
reported production budget of $50 million, though that figure does not
account for marketing and promotion expenses.</p>
<p>No new wide releases opened this weekend, leaving the box office top
10 once again to holdovers from previous weeks. Several have been in
theaters since Thanksgiving. One of those, “Moana 2,” claimed the No. 4
spot for Disney in its sixth weekend in theaters. The animated sequel
earned another $12.4 million, bumping its global total to $960.5
million.</p>
<p>The Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” dipped only slightly in
its second weekend, bringing in $8.1 million. With $41.7 million total,
it’s Searchlight’s highest grossing film since Disney acquired the
company in 2019.</p>
<p>A24’s erotic drama “Babygirl,” which added 49 locations, held steady
at $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Another Thanksgiving leftover, “Wicked,” rounded out the top five.
Universal’s movie musical was made available to purchase on VOD on
Jan. 31, but still earned another $10.2 million from theaters. The movie
is up for several awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including
nominations for Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, best motion picture
musical or comedy and “cinematic and box office achievement,” which last
year went to “Barbie.”</p>
<p>Also in theaters this weekend was the IMAX re-release of David
Fincher’s 4K restoration of “Seven,” which earned just over $1 million
from 200 locations.</p>
<p>The 2025 box office year is already off to a better start than 2024,
up around 20% from the same weekend last year.</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>

storm will not delay Trump election certification in Congress, House
leader says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A massive winter storm moving across the United States
will not keep the U.S. Congress from meeting on Monday to formally
certify Republican Donald Trump’s election as president, Republican
House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. </p>
<p>“The Electoral Count Act requires this on January 6 at 1 p.m. - so,
whether we’re in a blizzard or not we’re going to be in that chamber
making sure this is done,” Johnson told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning
Futures” in an interview.</p>
<p>Johnson said he hoped there would be full attendance despite the
storm and that he had encouraged lawmakers to stay in the city.  </p>
<p>Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central
Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said.
Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the
country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. </p>
<p>In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be
between 7 to 18 cm, promising a difficult commute and possible closings
of schools, government and businesses.  </p>
<p>Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan
area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times
been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. </p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to
Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on
Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won
control of both the chambers in November’s election. </p>
<p>Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather
delay. </p>
<p>“No change to the schedule,” said Lauren Fine, communications
director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. </p>
<p>The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four
years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in
a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the
2020 election. </p>
<p>Trump has continued to falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result
of widespread fraud. Biden and the Democrats say they will honor the
2024 election results and proceed with certification.</p>

id="new-orleans-attack-vegas-explosion-highlight-extremist-violence-by-active-military-and-veterans">New
Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active
military and veterans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in
New Orleans on New Year’s and another who died in an explosion in Las
Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people
with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially
those that seek mass casualties.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was
killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14
others dead and injured dozens more. It’s being investigated as an act
of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty
member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a
Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters,
shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump
International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators
said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a
“wakeup call” and that the country was “terminally ill and headed toward
collapse.”</p>
<p>Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction
of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their
country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found
that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members
was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds
had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that
extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or
injured nearly 100 people.</p>
<p>The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon’s efforts to
address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no
force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the
issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of
the problem.</p>
<p>Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized
at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to
data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study
of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of
Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in
the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a
disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found
between 2017 and 2022.</p>
<p>While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in
violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active
military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass
injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and
START.</p>
<p>More than 480 people with a military background were accused of
ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including
the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021,
insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last
year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military
backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill,
injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious
goals.</p>
<p>The AP’s analysis found that plots involving people with military
backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons
training or firearms than plots that didn’t include someone with a
military background. This held true whether or not the plots were
carried out.</p>
<p>The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected
to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of
previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around
9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist
ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with
far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the
rest split among far-left or other motivations.</p>
<p>Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by
the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S.
military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who’d
served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort
Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message
boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army
psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13
people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a
known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by
veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic
violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror
threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is “committed to
understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is
promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper
authorities.”</p>
<p>Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler
Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said
the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological
lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in
place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for
political reasons.</p>
<p>“They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that
all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration,”
Goldsmith said. “And now we’re in a situation where we’re four years
behind where we could have been.”</p>
<p>During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger
served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North
Carolina, one of the nation’s largest military bases. One of the
officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their
assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration
will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most
deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the
far right, particularly if Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete
Hegseth, is confirmed.</p>
<p>Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians
against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon’s efforts to address extremism
in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration in the weeks after
the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member
as a possible “insider threat.”</p>

<h2 id="fraud-allegations-rock-south-korean-adoptees-and-families">Fraud
allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an
instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child?</p>
<p>Peg Reif’s daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent
her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their
family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched,
children snatched off the street and sent abroad.</p>
<p>Reif wept.</p>
<p>She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this
fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline
exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children
abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting
shook adoption communities around the world with details about how
agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals,
fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were
adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this
system.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand the thought that somebody lost their child,” Reif
said. “I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know how to make it
right. I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her
husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico,
paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the
agency’s directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican
babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was
heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying,
“Thank God we don’t have a child who was stolen.”</p>
<p>But now she isn’t sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean
children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son
and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both
arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young
unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after
they got pregnant.</p>
<p>Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign
adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their
lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that anymore,” Reif said. “I don’t know what to
believe.”</p>
<p>Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters
to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense
of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified
identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide
practices that routinely changed babies’ origin stories to process
adoptions quickly, including listing them as “abandoned” even when they
had known parents.</p>
<p>Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what
he’s been hearing from adoptees: “I’m kind of back to nothing. What do I
believe now? Who can I believe?”</p>
<p>Reif’s daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was
unwanted, often quipping, “That’s what happens when you’re found in a
dumpster as a baby.”</p>
<p>It has taken a toll on her all her life: She’s been happily married
for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: “I
constantly find myself asking my husband, ‘Are you mad at me? Did I do
something wrong?’ Do you want to leave me?’”</p>
<p>She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story,
with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government
likened it to “trafficking.”</p>
<p>“You can’t make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was
this huge tree of deception,” she said. “I feel disgusted.”</p>
<p>Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions
from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this
story.</p>
<p>Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched
investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for
failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the
most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history
or culpability.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with
its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial
findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said
there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State
Department has since said that it has “been unable to identify any
records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in
adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.”</p>
<p>Korea’s National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees
registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police
stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the
weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in
September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and
November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January
to August.</p>
<p>Korea’s government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary
tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or
other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea’s Ministry of Health
and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and
80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs.</p>
<p>Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating
government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022,
prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to
release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP
stories on its website.</p>
<p>A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be
transferred from private agencies to a government department called the
National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the
handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that
private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung
Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these
records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The
agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically –
“possibly by tenfold,” according to Chung — yet has funding to add only
five staff members to its team of six searchers.</p>
<p>Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for
decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and
birth records to be preserved after 2012.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies
in records before then,” he said. “The adoption agency might have been
at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have
gone wrong at the orphanage … no one truly knows what the truth is.”</p>
<p>Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP’s requests for
comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the
parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the
industry as Reif and Hamilton have.</p>
<p>Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in
Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having
children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she
looked at him, and it took her breath away.</p>
<p>“It can’t explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life
that I’m biologically related to,” she said.</p>
<p>She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know
theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks
connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional,
shocking.</p>
<p>But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The
woman’s name didn’t match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she
gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn’t match, the
birthplace didn’t either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they
had been pen pals.</p>
<p>Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn’t
know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her
birth mother.</p>
<p>The AP’s reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected
adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover
after emotional meetings that they weren’t related at all.</p>
<p>Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father’s
side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half
great aunts.</p>
<p>“It becomes an obsession,” Hamilton said. “It’s like a puzzle that
you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.”</p>
<p>Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest
organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very
least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their
full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required.</p>
<p>Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in
Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents —
designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the
narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she
said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not
taken hold.</p>
<p>“We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have
any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility
and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these
practices and prevent it from ever happening again,” Long said.</p>
<p>Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to
accommodate their visits. She’s sad for herself, she said, but she’s
sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children
actually had parents somewhere, searching for them.</p>
<p>“And I’m like, ’Why, so you can send us back?” Hamilton said. “I
don’t want to be a victim.”</p>
<p>She said she’s glad she was adopted, and does not long for that
different, alternative life in Korea.</p>
<p>Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn’t think
she would adopt from abroad again, if she’d known then what she knows
now.</p>
<p>“I’d rather be childless than think I have somebody else’s child that
didn’t want to give them up,” she said. “I think of somebody taking my
child. Those poor families, I just can’t imagine it.”</p>

<h2 id="our-county-ignored-africa-jimmy-carter-said.-he-didnt">‘Our
county ignored Africa,’ Jimmy Carter said. He didn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NAIROBI, KENYA — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a
state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with
Zimbabwe’s transition from white rule to independence “our greatest
single success.” And when he died at 100, his foundation’s work in rural
Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that
afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of
smallpox.</p>
<p>The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling
China’s that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter’s legacy remains
most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little
interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in
the 1960s and ’70s.</p>
<p>“I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,” Carter said
during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous
country. He said the official state visit swept aside “past aloofness by
the United States,” and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun
Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together.</p>
<p>Cold War tensions drew Carter’s attention to the continent as the
U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on
the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice
he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South.</p>
<p>“For too long our country ignored Africa,” Carter told the Democratic
National Committee in his first year as president.</p>
<p>African leaders soon received invitations to the White House,
intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world’s most powerful nation
and what it could mean for them.</p>
<p>“There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,” visiting
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said.</p>
<p>Carter observed after his first Africa trip, “There is a common theme
that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: ‘We
want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the
great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don’t want to
choose up sides.’”</p>
<p>The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S.
for influence, and access to Africa’s raw materials. But neither
superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights
central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent
after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to
empower Africans to determine their own futures.</p>
<p>As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later
broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key
to public health.</p>
<p>“They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And
Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for
advancing this idea,” said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal
scholar.</p>
<p>Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish,
telling Playboy magazine, “it might be that now I should drop my
campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in
South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on,
we’ll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful
things and we didn’t take advantage of them.”</p>
<p>Carter welcomed Zimbabwe’s independence just four years later,
hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on
the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at
the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the
Middle East,” historian and author Nancy Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Relations with Mugabe’s government soon soured amid deadly repression
and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008,
Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the
country “a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now,
Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and ’80s, will
always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,”
said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst.</p>
<p>Carter also criticized South Africa’s government for its treatment of
Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was “trying
to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,”
current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter’s death.</p>
<p>The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key
role in monitoring African elections and brokering ceasefires between
warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter
Center’s work.</p>
<p>“The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight
with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing
to let AIDS be treated,” Carter told a local newspaper. “That’s the
closest I’ve come to getting into a fist fight with a head of
state.”</p>
<p>Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm
infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the
parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases
documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries.</p>
<p>Carter’s quest included arranging a four-month “guinea worm
cease-fire” in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach
almost 2,000 endemic villages.</p>
<p>“He taught us a lot about having faith,” said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who
leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan’s health
ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply
their fate. “Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To
have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them
is a touching virtue.”</p>
<p>Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the
years.</p>
<p>“President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race,
religion, or status,” Ethiopia’s former health minister, Lia Tadesse,
said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent’s second
most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm
cases in 2023.</p>

id="italys-meloni-boosts-ties-with-trump-in-surprise-florida-visit">Italy’s
Meloni boosts ties with Trump in surprise Florida visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made
a surprise trip to Florida to meet with Donald Trump late on Saturday,
as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with the
president-elect before his inauguration on January 20. </p>
<p>Members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause
after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared
on social media by reporters and others. </p>
<p>“This is very exciting. I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime
minister of Italy,” Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a
media pool report. “She’s really taken Europe by storm.” </p>
<p>Meloni is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her
conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition
she has led in Italy since late 2022. </p>
<p>She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO
Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter of a billion
dollars to help him win the election. </p>
<p>Tommaso Foti, Italy’s EU and regional affairs minister, said on
Sunday that the meeting, which had not been announced in advance, showed
that Italy could act as “a diplomatic bridge between two worlds: the
European Union and the USA.” </p>
<p>Meloni’s trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe
Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated
Biden in the November election and is preparing to return to the White
House. </p>
<p>While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had
planned to talk with Trump about Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade issues,
the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in
Tehran, according to Italian media reports. </p>
<p>Trump and Meloni watched a screening of a documentary questioning the
criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a
former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to
overturn his 2020 election loss. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian
journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. </p>
<p>Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian
businessman, was arrested at Milan’s Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant
for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a
2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has
denied involvement in the attack. </p>
<p>Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have
visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with
Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of
Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

id="jimmy-carters-state-funeral-has-started.-heres-what-to-know">Jimmy
Carter’s state funeral has started. Here’s what to know</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former
President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on
Dec. 29 at the age of 100.</p>
<p>The first events reflected Carter’s climb up the political ladder,
from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as
a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.</p>
<p>Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens
next:</p>
<p>The start honors Carter’s deep roots in rural south Georgia</p>
<p>The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the
Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.</p>
<p>Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as
pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its
way to Plains.</p>
<p>James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and
around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more
than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents —
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in
small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in
his birthplace for his long post-presidency.</p>
<p>The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few
blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn
Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where
the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also
included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter’s 1976
presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by
Carter’s younger brother, Billy.</p>
<p>The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters
married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former
president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.</p>
<p>The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret
Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and
lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the
Governor’s Mansion and four more in the White House.</p>
<p>A stop at Carter’s boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work</p>
<p>After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of
Carter’s family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town,
after passing the cemetery where the former president’s parents, James
Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.</p>
<p>The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.
The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the
39th president.</p>
<p>Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had
no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his
father’s land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had
relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming
families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local
civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered
Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for
the family.</p>
<p>It was Earl’s death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval
Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a
submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon’s nuclear
program to take over the family’s peanut business after his father’s
death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.</p>
<p>Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global
figure</p>
<p>From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run
motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a
state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian
Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While
former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even
if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run
by the federal government.</p>
<p>The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which
includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center,
established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter’s
son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke
to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work
concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election
monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to
set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center’s annual reports until 2019,
won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential
work.</p>
<p>Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m.
Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock.</p>
<p>What’s next: A return to Washington</p>
<p>Carter’s remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in
state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at
the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been
invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also
signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after
Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.</p>
<p>The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains
after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist
Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for
decades.</p>
<p>Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a
plot visible from the front porch of his home.</p>

<h2 id="feds-kugler-daly-say-job-not-done-on-inflation">Fed’s Kugler,
Daly say job not done on inflation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S.
central bank’s job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also
signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try
to finish that job. </p>
<p>The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed
President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S.
central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate
cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point
last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. </p>
<p>Inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure is well down from its
mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that’s
above the Fed’s 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower
progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. </p>
<p>“We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping
champagne anywhere,” Kugler said at the annual American Economic
Association conference in San Francisco, California. “And at the same
time … we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is” and not
increase rapidly. </p>
<p>In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and
colleague Daly’s view with maximum employment, the Fed’s second goal
alongside its price stability goal. </p>
<p>“At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor
market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given
month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,” said
Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. </p>
<p>The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views,
about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump’s
economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have
speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.</p>

id="jill-biden-gets-priciest-gift-from-foreign-leader-in-2023-a-20000-diamond">Jill
Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000
diamond</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of
thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to
an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with
first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a
$20,000 diamond from India’s leader.</p>
<p>The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was
easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family
in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the
Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and
photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of
Egypt.</p>
<p>The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents,
including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South
Korea’s recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of
Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver
bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the
president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they
receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated
value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are
relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not
always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official
displays.</p>
<p>The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House
East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other
gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives.</p>
<p>Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond
will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not
say what it was being used for.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that
a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian
rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its
“true value … lies in its symbolism.” The embassy’s spokesperson, Halyna
Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value.</p>
<p>Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S.
government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with
high-end items.</p>
<p>According to the State Department’s Office of Protocol, which
compiles the list that will be published in Friday’s edition of the
Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish
gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were
destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000
combined.</p>
<p>CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a
telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity
is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services
Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000
Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury
timepieces.</p>
<p>Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are
not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra
watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring
bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100.</p>
<p>All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a
$30,000 women’s jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting
of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA
employee.</p>
<p>Another CIA employee reported receiving a men’s Yacht Master II Rolex
Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady’s
Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a
$7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed,
according to the list.</p>
<p>Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage
Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report
says.</p>

finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that
troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during
previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War
II.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing
examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders
linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement
released Saturday.</p>
<p>The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during
previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in
1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by
Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely
open about its past dealings with Nazis.</p>
<p>The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered
files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was
found to have a “high relevance rate” of Nazi connections.</p>
<p>It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former
prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an “independent ombudsperson”
by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative
work.</p>
<p>Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 “as a result of the
committee’s investigation,” and after UBS’s takeover of Credit
Suisse.</p>
<p>In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the
“extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the
leadership of UBS, has provided” since he rejoined the company.</p>
<p>But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it
held.</p>
<p>The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts
controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>In his letter, Barofsky highlighted “especially noteworthy”
discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department.</p>
<p>“Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating
‘Amerikanische schwarze Liste’ — meaning ‘American Black List’ — a list
maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly
financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers,” he
wrote.</p>
<p>“One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved
in selling looted Jewish assets,” he added.</p>
<p>Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete
record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse’s predecessor
banks.</p>
<p>It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in
his work to shed light “on this tragic period.”</p>
<p>The Senate panel’s investigation is continuing.</p>

data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy
concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. </p>
<p>That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla
collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las
Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive
by Elon Musk’s company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a
difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like
computers on wheels. </p>
<p>“You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on
criminals but can anyone have access to it?” said Jodi Daniels, CEO of
privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors.  </p>
<p>Many of the latest cars not only know where you’ve been and where you
are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs,
your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone
syncing. </p>
<p>The data collected by Musk’s electric car company after the
Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump
International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track
the driver’s movements. </p>
<p>Within hours of the New Year’s Day explosion that burned the driver
beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew
Livelsberger’s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and
confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck
itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from
onboard software. </p>
<p>“I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,” said Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters.
 </p>
<p>Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. </p>
<p>“It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,” said David
Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute
at Northeastern University in Boston. “When something bad happens, it’s
helpful, but it’s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data
can abuse it.” </p>
<p>General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas
attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to
insurance companies without their consent. </p>
<p>Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added
a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported
how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers’ sensitive videos
and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents
and, in one case, nudity. </p>
<p>Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy.
On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and
information private. </p>
<p>“No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or
a history of where you’ve been,” according to a statement. “Your
information is kept private and secure.” </p>
<p>Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn’t
think Tesla is “especially worse” than other auto companies in handling
customer data, but he is still concerned. </p>
<p>“This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern
vehicles. They’re connected,” he said. “Consumers need to have control
over their data.” </p>
<p>Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of
Trump’s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier,
a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental
service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New
Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist
attack. </p>
<p>Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were
investigating a second incident. </p>
<p>“The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,”
Musk wrote on X. “Will post more information as soon as we learn
anything.” </p>
<p>Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together
Livelsberger’s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among
other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including
Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.</p>

<h2 id="drivers-skid-crash-as-winter-storm-grips-central-us">Drivers
skid, crash as winter storm grips central US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the
central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging
temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread
eastward in the coming days.</p>
<p>“Winter returned,” said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National
Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the
North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches
down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that’s when large numbers of
people experience intense doses of cold.</p>
<p>Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the
increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering.</p>
<p>Snow and ice in forecast</p>
<p>By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central
Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where
there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the
interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon.</p>
<p>The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe
travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states
Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as
Florida.</p>
<p>Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail,
were also possible ahead of the storm system’s cold front as it crosses
the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned.</p>
<p>Car wrecks</p>
<p>A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles
overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into
ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said.</p>
<p>He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway
blacktop like an ice-skating rink.</p>
<p>“We are in it now,” Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an
accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways
were nearly impassable.</p>
<p>Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple
crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if
possible and watch out for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states
of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous
to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters
warned.</p>
<p>Getting ready</p>
<p>Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries
in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and
libraries.</p>
<p>Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school
district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to
cancel classes for one or more days.</p>
<p>“Get where you’re going now &amp; stay put. If you must travel,
consider packing a bag &amp; staying where you’re headed,” the Missouri
Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform
X.</p>
<p>The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the
ability to clear roads.</p>
<p>In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing
liquids.</p>
<p>“It will be a major headache,” said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist
with AccuWeather. “The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the
ice threat.”</p>
<p>Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas
City area, Kines said.</p>
<p>Temperatures dip</p>
<p>Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will
experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters
said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the
polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.</p>
<p>In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius
and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at
International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Disruptions extend southward</p>
<p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday
evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people’s ability to
vote in the state’s special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he
encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather
arrives.</p>
<p>A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the
historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove
vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to
open several garages on Sunday for free parking.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of
snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing
throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing
agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City
officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees
Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-south-korea-japan-france">Blinken heads to
South Korea, Japan, France</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is
expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling
to South Korea, Japan and France. </p>
<p>The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul,
South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. </p>
<p>In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following
the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends
to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part
of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. </p>
<p>That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the
region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political
developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law
and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of
Washington-Seoul relations. </p>
<p>The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting
that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken
will speak with South Korean officials about how “to build on our
critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared
values,” the State Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>In Tokyo, Blinken will “review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan
alliance has made over the past few years,” the statement said. That
includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the
U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related
equipment and training to Japan. </p>
<p>China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it
will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both
Japan and the U.S. reject. </p>
<p>Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French
officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European
security, particularly in Ukraine.</p>

id="exiled-venezuelan-opposition-leader-to-visit-us-speak-with-biden">Exiled
Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo
Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and
subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S.
President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei,
Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday,
though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take
place. </p>
<p>“We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are
waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities,” Gonzalez said in
the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming
President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January
20. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour
aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela’s
opposition considers the rightful president-elect. </p>
<p>The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa
Rosada, the Argentine president’s official workplace, as hundreds of
Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted “Venezuela, you
are not alone!” </p>
<p>The appearance came just days before Gonzalez’s rival, Nicolas
Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in
Caracas. </p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries
say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which
they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections.  </p>
<p>Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the  winner. </p>
<p>Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has
lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in
Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his
capture. </p>
<p>Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into
clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than
2,400 arrested. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday,
Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. </p>
<p>He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as
president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will
respond. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions
following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what
Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. </p>
<p>The relationship was already strained following an exchange of
insults and, ultimately, Argentina’s refusal to recognize Maduro’s
victory claim. </p>
<p>The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six
opposition figures accused of “terrorism,” a matter Gonzalez had said he
would take up with Milei.</p>
