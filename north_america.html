      <p>
      <p>American enthusiasm for capitalism is slipping, especially among Democrats. That’s the headline from a new Gallup poll out this week. In this latest survey, just 54% of respondents said they view capitalism positively. That’s down from 60% the last time Gallup asked in 2021. We'll hear more. Plus, we'll get fresh reads on consumer and producer prices this week. How much might these affect a rate cut by the Fed?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> France's push to get a grip on its debt problem is expected to result in the ousting of another prime minister, François Bayrou. President Emmanuel Macron must convince European allies and financial markets that he'll get a debt-reducing budget approved by the end of the year. Plus, as gold continues to hit record highs, London's bullion market is preparing to go digital. And the succession battle at Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has ended with his eldest son, Lachlan, securing control.</p>

      <p>China's exports to the U.S. are down a third year over year. That’s a significant drop, reflective of President Trump’s punishing tariff agenda. Although China’s overall export growth has slowed, it still rose 4.5% in August — thanks, in part, to strategic redirection to new markets. In this episode, what the U.S. stands to lose by cutting off China as a trade partner. Plus: Luxury brands remain mostly insulated from economic uncertainty and fintech firm Robinhood prepares to join the S&amp;P 500.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has gotten a lot of attention lately — President Trump is attempting to remove one member and has nominated another. But there’s more under the central bank umbrella than president-appointed officials. In this episode, we break down why regional Fed banks and Fed presidents matter. Plus: The latest Beige book shows an uptick in lending, shipping costs are down and an economist walks us through her process for reading a CPI report.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Economic data rolling out this week has helped paint a snapshot of the economy. We found out yesterday that 5.3 million people were hired and 5.3 million quit or were laid off in July. Fresh data out this morning revealed that the private sector added only 54,000 jobs last month. Today, we'll discuss this slowing job growth. Plus, an illegal sports streaming site is shut down, and Texas is restricting the ability of certain foreign nationals to own property.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There's a black market trade for everything — including ants. (Yes, even ants.) And President Donald Trump has slashed the number of federal government employees, which included entomologists focused on pest control. Today, we'll look at what the illicit ant trade looks like and the sort of environmental and financial costs that can result from invasive species. But first, Trump has his first chance at reshaping the Federal Reserve through the nomination of Stephen Miran.</p>

      <p>Job growth has slowed this summer as employers ride out President Trump's economic shakeups. Thanks to uncertain tariffs, funding cuts, and the immigration crackdown, most companies aren’t eager to hire right now. Even the health care sector is showing some cracks. Also in this episode: The number of American homeowners fell for the first time in a decade, economists explain how the U.S. became the economic data gold standard, and revenue from website ads grow more popular among retailers.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>The big budget bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in July allowed tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to expire. That means health insurance costs will increase significantly for millions, disproportionately hitting small business owners and self-employed people. We’ll learn about the impacts. Also this morning: Retailers have already shifted focus from back-to-school shopping to holiday sales. Thing is, the outlook doesn't look too rosy this year.</p>

      <p>We're talking about companies here, obviously. A decade after Kraft Heinz became one of the world’s biggest food companies, it’s reversing course and is splitting into two. It’s not the only corporation to go this route recently: There’s Warner Bros Discovery, which is separating into two media companies, and Honeywell, which is separating into three. What's behind all this restructuring? Also on the show: renewed interest in IPOs and promised safety improvements from OpenAI.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Car dealerships always feel the fluctuations of inflation, gas prices, and interest rates. Now, tariffs are added to the mix, hitting their bottom lines at a time when consumers are wary about the future of the economy. In an industry that already contends with relatively slim margins, we'll hear how car sellers are faring. But first, we'll delve into the Federal Reserve's dilemma: worry more about the job market or price increases?</p>

      <p>Summer travel is usually supposed to be a major time for the tourism industry. But this year, budget-conscious American travelers are adjusting their vacation plans. Consumers are actually taking more trips than initially anticipated, but they're tending to be shorter, less expensive, and later in the summer than usual.

His move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud has now been challenged by a lawsuit from Cook.

And later, we'll hear about tariff-related anxiety from India, including from a South Indian hub supplying global clothing brands and Mumbai’s diamond workshops.</p>

      <h1>Small packages, big changes</h1>

      <p>You may have heard that big things come in small packages. Now, tariffs do too. The "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases less than $800 ends Friday. Parcels will then be subject to the tariff for whatever country from which they’re shipped. Plus, why Nvidia's quarterly results are a big deal and how a less independent Federal Reserve could affect the value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It's a tough day for India. Most of its exports to the United States will now face a 50% tariff. It's a major shift between the two countries, which used to be partners, especially in tech and defense. We'll learn about the impacts. Plus, European carmakers are claiming that hitting the EU’s 2035 CO2 emissions targets is no longer realistic. Plus, a K-pop-themed musical has become the most-watched movie on Netflix.</p>

      Economic sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine were set to force Moscow's hand. But the U.S. and Europe continue to rely on Russian imports.

      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan and Australia are among the latest countries suspending some postal deliveries to the United States. And it's all down to confusion over tariffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month ending the global import tax exemption on small packages worth under $800 entering the U.S. duty-free, a change due to take effect on Friday. Also, Boeing and Korean Air have announced a deal worth $36 billion for over 100 planes.</p>
