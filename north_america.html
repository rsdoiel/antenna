      White House economist Stephen Miran was quizzed by senators about whether he could make decisions independently of President Trump, if he's confirmed to a seat on the Federal Reserve's governing board.

      <p>Economic data rolling out this week has helped paint a snapshot of the economy. We found out yesterday that 5.3 million people were hired and 5.3 million quit or were laid off in July. Fresh data out this morning revealed that the private sector added only 54,000 jobs last month. Today, we'll discuss this slowing job growth. Plus, an illegal sports streaming site is shut down, and Texas is restricting the ability of certain foreign nationals to own property.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There's a black market trade for everything — including ants. (Yes, even ants.) And President Donald Trump has slashed the number of federal government employees, which included entomologists focused on pest control. Today, we'll look at what the illicit ant trade looks like and the sort of environmental and financial costs that can result from invasive species. But first, Trump has his first chance at reshaping the Federal Reserve through the nomination of Stephen Miran.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> India's Finance Minister has announced massive tax cuts on hundreds of everyday consumer items. The move is aimed at boosting domestic demand amid 50% American tariffs on Indian exports. Then, a group of English-speaking hackers claims to be behind a massive cyberattack that's halted global production lines at Jaguar Land Rover. And Texas has become the latest U.S. state to impose restrictions on some foreign-born people and businesses buying or renting property.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Job growth has slowed this summer as employers ride out President Trump's economic shakeups. Thanks to uncertain tariffs, funding cuts, and the immigration crackdown, most companies aren’t eager to hire right now. Even the health care sector is showing some cracks. Also in this episode: The number of American homeowners fell for the first time in a decade, economists explain how the U.S. became the economic data gold standard, and revenue from website ads grow more popular among retailers.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>The big budget bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in July allowed tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to expire. That means health insurance costs will increase significantly for millions, disproportionately hitting small business owners and self-employed people. We’ll learn about the impacts. Also this morning: Retailers have already shifted focus from back-to-school shopping to holiday sales. Thing is, the outlook doesn't look too rosy this year.</p>

      <p>We're talking about companies here, obviously. A decade after Kraft Heinz became one of the world’s biggest food companies, it’s reversing course and is splitting into two. It’s not the only corporation to go this route recently: There’s Warner Bros Discovery, which is separating into two media companies, and Honeywell, which is separating into three. What's behind all this restructuring? Also on the show: renewed interest in IPOs and promised safety improvements from OpenAI.</p>

Then, police in Singapore have ordered Facebook's parent company, Meta, to take measures to prevent scammers from impersonating government officials.

It’s kinda like an afternoon snack — perhaps not great for you, but it’ll hold you over until dinner. In this episode, what it means that commercial paper bonds have been ramping up all year. Plus: Iconic millennial-focused brands pivot to Gen Z consumers, the BLS cares if you’ve got free time, and the Trump White House closely monitors U.S. chip manufacturing progress.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>As the Trump administration strips away federal data collection agencies' funding and pressures statisticians to produce positive reports, we might wonder whether private data can fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, while statistics reported by the private sector have a place in our economic understanding, they're not necessarily comprehensive, transparent, or free.

      <p>
      <p>Car dealerships always feel the fluctuations of inflation, gas prices, and interest rates. Now, tariffs are added to the mix, hitting their bottom lines at a time when consumers are wary about the future of the economy. In an industry that already contends with relatively slim margins, we'll hear how car sellers are faring. But first, we'll delve into the Federal Reserve's dilemma: worry more about the job market or price increases?</p>

      <p>Summer travel is usually supposed to be a major time for the tourism industry. But this year, budget-conscious American travelers are adjusting their vacation plans.

      <p>While Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawyer says she will sue to challenge the president's move to fire her, the White House is reportedly getting ready to appoint Cook’s replacement. Today, we'll unpack how this battle is impacting markets as the Trump administration continues to test the limits of its authority. And later, we'll hear about tariff-related anxiety from India, including from a South Indian hub supplying global clothing brands and Mumbai’s diamond workshops.</p>

      <p>You may have heard that big things come in small packages. Now, tariffs do too. The "de minimis" tariff exemption for purchases less than $800 ends Friday. Parcels will then be subject to the tariff for whatever country from which they’re shipped. Plus, why Nvidia's quarterly results are a big deal and how a less independent Federal Reserve could affect the value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

      <p>
      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip? Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A trade agreement between the United States and the European Union means that U.S. tariffs on imported European goods will be significantly lower than previously thought. The U.S. will cap tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors at 15%. That's a huge decrease from prior threats of levies as high as 250%. Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>
