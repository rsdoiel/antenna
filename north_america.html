<p>Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.</p>
<p>Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.</p>

      <p>With Nicolás Maduro in US custody, Donald Trump says ‘we will run’ Venezuela until ‘a safe, proper and judicious transition’ can be made – key US politics stories from 3 January 2026</p>
<p>The US attacked Venezuela and captured its long-serving president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> on Saturday, with Donald Trump promising to put the country under American control for now, even as Venezuelan officials vowed defiance.</p>

      <h1>Venezuela attack: what we know so far as US captures President Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-03)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live">US strikes on Venezuela – live updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:</p>
<p>Donald Trump said <strong>“We’re going to run the country</strong>[Venezuela] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.</p>
<p><strong>A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening</strong> and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation</strong> <strong>, Trump</strong> <strong>said.</strong> He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.</strong> It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>UN security council</strong> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0">due to hold</a> an emergency meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump said his administration <strong>had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong>. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump was asked about Cuba</strong> during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”</p>
<p>The <strong>US Department of Justice released a new indictment</strong> against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.</p>
<p><strong>The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”</strong> <strong>.</strong> Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398">wrote</a>: “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro</strong> <strong>was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.</strong> The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.</p>
<p>The <strong>UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela</strong>, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.</p>

<p>A plane carrying captured Venezuelan leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> and his wife, Cilia Flores, has arrived in New York hours after an overnight US military attack that Donald Trump hailed as “an assault like people have not seen since world war two” as he vowed the US would run the leaderless country.</p>
<p>Trump, speaking at <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/pres-trump-holds-news-conference-on-us-airstrikes-against-venezuela/671134">a press conference</a> at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday, provided few details after ousting Maduro in an audacious military attack but said the US would be in control of Venezuela until there is an orderly transition of power.</p>

<p>The United States has seen the number of influenza cases climb significantly in December, coming after the most severe flu season since 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether there will be an increase in the total number of people who get the flu this season – or whether more people just got it at once in December – but more than 3,100 people died from the virus in the US in the year ending August 2025, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html">latest data</a> from the CDC.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007428087143686611">The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on X</a> that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the southern district of New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States.</p>

<p>As they were jolted from their beds just before 2am on Saturday, many Caracas residents sought an innocent explanation for the racket that had interrupted their sleep: an exploding air conditioning unit, a tropical thunderstorm, an earthquake. Or perhaps a festive display of pyrotechnics over Venezuela’s mountain-flanked capital.</p>
<p>“I thought it might be fireworks,” Carlos Hurtado, a resident of the 23 de Enero housing estate on the city’s west side, recalled of the moment he was woken by a mysterious sequence of rumblings and explosions.</p>

<p>Overnight on Friday, the US carried out airstrikes across Venezuela, with explosions rocking the capital, Caracas, before dawn. Shortly afterwards, Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them out of the country.</p>
<p>The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said they would face trial in New York on charges of involvement in narco-terrorism. A fresh indictment was issued on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The Sisters of Watts have served families for a decade, providing food, fitness, money and after-school programs</p>
<p>The weekend before Thanksgiving, the gymnasium in Ted Watkins park in the south Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts was crowded with more than 100 families. For three hours, they ate and talked while their kids ran around and a DJ blasted west coast hip-hop staples during games of limbo and musical chairs.</p>
<p>Toward the back of the room, people clamored around a step-and-repeat to get a picture with the event’s organizers: four siblings known as the Sisters of Watts, who for the past decade have arranged food giveaways, backpack drives and after-school activities for kids growing up on the same blocks they did. At this event, there were bags of fresh produce available for families that wanted them.</p>

      <p>New documents reveal numerous missed opportunities as experts and victims condemn US authorities’ failures</p>
<p>Over the course of two decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women. And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.</p>
<p>The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct. The issue has been the subject of many conspiracy theories, often focusing on the idea that Epstein – who lived at the center of a network of powerful people – enjoyed some form of protection.</p>

<p>Christian Sturdivant, 18, of Mint Hill – a town outside Charlotte – was arrested on 31 December as he was being released from a special medical facility. He was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the US attorney for the western district of North Carolina, Russ Ferguson, said at a press conference on Friday morning.</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>A shift away from police-led responses spreads, but gaps in crisis teams leave some communities exposed</p>
<p>In the past year, a handful of sheriff’s departments in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> have <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/04/mental-health-crisis-california-police-response/">started refusing to respond</a> to 911 calls that involve a mental health crisis, but where no crime has been reported.</p>
<p>In February, the Sacramento sheriff, Jim Cooper, announced that his deputies would only respond to mental health crises if a crime had been committed or was in process, or if someone other than the person in crisis was in imminent danger. Down in San Diego county, the police chief for the city of El Cajon, Jeremiah Larson, made a similar policy decision in May.</p>

We look at what Abel’s leadership could mean for an empire that touches everything from energy to insurance. Plus, stocks had a strong year, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting double-digit gains, but the job market tells a very different story. And do professional movie critics still matter in an age of Reddit threads and Letterboxd reviews?</p>

      <h1>2025 was a big year for climate in the US courts - these were the wins and losses</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable. Here are major trends that emerged last year</p>
<p>As the Trump administration boosts fossil fuels, Americans are increasingly turning to courts to hold big oil accountable for alleged climate deception. That wave of litigation swelled in 2025, with groundbreaking cases filed and wins notched.</p>
<p>But the year also brought setbacks, as Trump attacked the cases and big oil worked to have them thrown out. The industry also worked to secure a shield from current and future climate lawsuits.</p>

      <h1>Amid wide healthcare cuts, a bright spot for rural hospitals</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Healthcare costs are climbing for many Americans as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits roll back, raising premiums for middle-income households unless Congress intervenes. In this vacuum, we look at a major new federal investment aimed at expanding healthcare access in rural communities. Plus, U.S. travel is sending mixed signals this year — domestic travel is booming, but fewer international visitors are visiting the States, and that shift is being felt by America’s museums.</p>

      <p>Blaze that swept through crowded New Year’s Eve bar in Crans-Montana also injured 115 people. Plus, the politicians and advocates making climate policy part of the affordability agenda</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Swiss investigators are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire">racing to identify the victims of a fire</a> that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fire start?</strong> The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to identify the dead?</strong> Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he say?</strong> Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”</p>

      <p>The world of soccer throws up no shortage of questions every year. In today’s Pitch Points column, we address three of the big ones for 2026</p>
<p>You may have heard there’s a World Cup this year. After all the debate about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/18/analysis-how-prices-for-the-cheapest-world-cup-tickets-have-rocketed">ticket prices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/trump-peace-prize-fifa-world-cup">peace prizes</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/08/fifa-world-cup-2026-cooling-breaks">cooling breaks</a>, an actual soccer tournament will kick off. That’s when the US, both as a national team and a host nation, will truly be judged; when the 2026 World Cup will be deemed a soaring success or a grotesque failure. There will be no in between. No nuance. That vanished from public discourse a long time ago.</p>

      <h1>‘No one can know’: Heated Rivalry’s gay love story exposes ice hockey’s culture of silence</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>The surprise hit series has reopened a familiar debate: why, in the National Hockey League, visibility is still treated as a problem rather than a possibility</p>
<p>At around the midpoint of the first episode of Heated Rivalry, just after Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov – one Canadian, the other Russian, both hockey’s top prospects – have had their first tryst, Hollander sits at the side of his hotel bed and says: “So. You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?” Rozanov, lying naked beside him, replies sarcastically: “Me? Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”</p>
<p>No one can know. If hockey were to have an unofficial slogan, this might be it. Heated Rivalry, the surprise 2025 hit series from Crave and HBO, is layered drama, prompting timely questions about the barriers to acceptance that persist within sport even as they are lowered elsewhere across society.

      <h1>The year in charitable giving</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The winter holiday season is a key time for nonprofit fundraising — an estimated 30% of annual giving happens in December. But in 2025, highly publicized federal cuts resulted in an individual giving boost throughout the year. In this episode, some nonprofits worry demand will soon outgrow those private donations. Plus: Latino immigrants say deportation fears are reminiscent of the Covid-19 lockdown, communities fight to buy back private utilities, and “This Is Uncomfortable” host Reema Khrais gives tips for sticking to financial New Year’s resolutions.</p>

      <h1>From "This Is Uncomfortable": "You'll never be ready to buy a home"</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p><em>Hey smarties! Happy New Year. We’re taking a short break for the holidays. In the meantime, we’re sharing an episode from our friends over at “This Is Uncomfortable.” Reema Khrais and the team are getting ready to relaunch the show on Jan. 15. Stay tuned for new episodes!</em></p>
<p>When newlyweds Chantal and Travis Lisback started searching for their dream home in Seattle, they weren’t entirely on the same page. Chantal was eager to settle down as soon as possible, while Travis was more comfortable waiting a few years. As the search dragged on, what began as a shared dream started to feel more like a standoff.</p>
<p>This week, a story about how a big life decision can bring to light the money and communication issues you didn’t know were there. Plus, later in the episode, Chantal and Travis sit down with financial therapist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ajaetherapy/">Aja Evans</a> to unpack what’s happening beneath the surface, and how to approach money fights with more care and intention.</p>

<p>One of the biggest unanswered questions for many folks considering an e-bike isn’t how a bike rides on day one, but rather how it holds up after years of daily use. Reviews and first impressions are everywhere, but genuine long-term ownership stories are surprisingly rare. That’s why a recent shared case from a rider who just crossed 10,000 miles (16,000 km) on their e-bike caught my attention.</p>

<p>Trump told the Journal that the large dose of aspirin he take daily causes him to bruise easily and that doctors have encouraged him to take a lower dose – but he declined the advice because he has been taking it for 25 years.</p>

      <h1>Abortion may no longer be a top priority for Democratic voters ahead of 2026 midterms, polls show</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Abortion was seen as one of Democrats’ strongest issues in the 2024 election – new polls indicate that may be shifting</p>
<p>Up to seven states will vote on abortion rights this year. But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count onthe issue in their efforts todrive votes in the 2026 midterms, after makingabortion rightsthe centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followedthe fall of Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/09/poll-abortion-voters-motivations-priorities/">PRRI’s findings mirror a September poll</a> from the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.</p>

      <p>Sheldon Whitehouse, an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center board, remains undeterred and determined to press on with his investigation</p>
<p>“That’s the tactic they use,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island senator, pondering whether Donald Trump might attach his name to the <a href="https://www.kennedy-center.org/">John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>. “You float stuff and you float stuff and you float stuff until people get inured to what a stupid or outrageous thing it is that has been floated and then you pull the trigger.”</p>
<p>Whitehouse was sitting in his Senate office and speaking to the Guardian at 11am on Thursday 18 December. Two hours later, his words proved prophetic. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/2001717032191168839?s=20">announced on X</a> that the Kennedy Center board had “voted unanimously” to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center.</p>

      <p>Complaint argues Trump administration denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination</p>
<p>The Trump administration is facing a legal complaint from a group of government employees affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Gas prices hit their lowest level for a December since 2020, according to AAA, thanks largely to a global oil glut that pushed crude prices down about 20% last year. We look at whether cheaper fuel is likely to stick around in 2025. Plus, a new business in New York City doubles as a museum celebrating the history and cultural impact of the photo booth. And we examine how the expiration of federal tax credits is reshaping the electric vehicle market after a rocky year.</p>

<p>A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.</p>
<p>Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.</p>

      <h1>‘I don’t think we should have billionaires’: mayor Zohran Mamdani in his own words</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the democratic socialist who is now mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos">viral memes</a> and its candidate’s witty quips.</p>
<p>Here are some of the quotes that came to define his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats">historic</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral">push</a> to lead one of the world’s most important cities:</p>
<p>New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.</p>
<p>What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.</p>
<p>No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.</p>
<p>It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.</p>
<p>I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.</p>
<p>I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.</p>
<p>I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.</p>
<p>If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!</p>

      <p>
      <p>Today’s newsletter looks at 10 superlative talents who are ready to take the next step in the coming 12 months</p>
<p><strong>Alara Sehitler</strong> <strong>, Bayern Munich and Germany (19):</strong> Sehitler’s transition into Bayern Munich’s first team has come as little surprise and the creative midfielder has established herself as a strong impact player for José Barcala’s side. She has three Frauen Bundesliga goals this season and sparked Bayern’s comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League. After making her senior debut for Germany in November 2024, she will be looking to establish herself as a regular for their upcoming 2027 World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Giulia Galli</strong> <strong>, Roma and Italy (17):</strong> Galli is widely regarded as one of the best young Italian talents to emerge for a long time and became Roma’s youngest player to make her Serie A debut in May 2024, aged 16 and one month. Establishing herself in the senior squad this season, she scored her first club goal in September and has featured in the Champions League. After starring in Italy’s sensational run to the semi-finals of last summer’s Under-17 Euros, the talented forward played a significant role at the subsequent Under-17 World Cup, picking up the bronze boot. She will surely feature at this autumn’s Under-20 World Cup.</p>

      <h1>How to talk dating like gen Z: 51 (hyperspecific) terms for love, sex and bad behavior</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>As young people take on a messy dating landscape, they’ve created their own lexicon to match. Here’s like what phrases ‘bird theory’ and ‘monkey branching’ mean</p>
<p>This year marked a decade since the term “ghosting” hit the mainstream. At the time, the idea that someone could abruptly cease communication with a lover without explanation seemed like the peak of indignity. How naive we were. In the 10 years since, finding a partner has only become more confounding – an oftentimes fruitless exercise in humiliation that is increasingly pigeonholed by social media jargon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">Gen Z</a>, a cohort who came of age during a loneliness epidemic, a masculinity crisis, and a coordinated attack on the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, faces a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2025/nov/28/gen-z-sex-dating-relationships">far messier landscape</a> than their millennial predecessors could ever imagine. And so their dating glossary has grown longer and more deranged, with phrases like “Shrekking” and “monkey branching” testing the limits of your sanity.</p>
<p><strong>Red flags</strong> – Behavioral quirks indicating a potential partner is bad news. Examples include calling their exes crazy, subpar tipping habits, a love of Woody Allen films, a burgeoning DJ career …</p>
<p><strong>Green flags</strong> – These quirks validate your decision to pursue a mate. Examples include checking in to make sure you got home safe after a date, low screen time, owning a bed frame …</p>
<p><strong>Beige flags</strong> – These usually describe niche, mostly benign quirks. Examples include being an enthusiastic birdwatcher, still carrying around a pen in their purse, paying rent in cash …</p>

      <h1>A tech company that ‘happens to build homes’</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>When it comes to homebuilding, Ronda Conger, vice president of CBH Homes, wants to be like the Savannah Bananas.</p>
<p>“We are out there trying to do things so differently,” she said. “It’s one of the reasons we embraced AI so quickly.”</p>
<p>But there are growing fears that artificial intelligence will begin to replace human employees. For Conger’s team, the bots are doing the grunt work, so the real humans can shine.</p>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>The continent’s problems are not caused by immigration or cultural politics but by economic and technological decline</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">national security strategy</a> offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.</p>
<p>That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the <a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/">US</a> is slightly higher than <a href="https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/">in Europe</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Black and brown former employees from CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue talk about the effects of being let go</p>
<p>Trey Sherman was traveling to work on the New York subway when he received an email from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/07/bari-weiss-cbs-news-remake/">David Reiter</a>, a CBS News executive, about an imminent meeting on 29 October. Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html">more than 2,000 jobs</a> as part of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.</p>

<p>The US justice department is believed to be reviewing more than 5m pages of documents relating to the disgraced financier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> – an effort that is drawing resources away from existing cases, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/30/us/politics/esptein-files-5-million-pages.html">the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The figure represents a significant expansion on earlier estimates, which drew on calculations based on 300 gigabytes of data, papers, videos, photographs and audio files held within FBI archives that relate to investigations in Florida and New York.</p>

<p>In prisons and jails across the US, people are routinely fed unhealthy, tasteless or inedible meals. Many are left hungry and malnourished, with devastating long-term health consequences. The hidden crisis affecting millions of incarcerated people is the subject of <a href="https://thenewpress.org/books/eating-behind-bars/?v=eb65bcceaa5f">Eating Behind Bars</a>, a new book offering a disturbing account of how correctional institutions punish their residents through the food they provide and withhold.</p>

      <p>Bylaws that would limit voting to Trump-appointed trustees appears to reveal long-held renaming plan</p>
<p>The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.</p>
<p>The bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/12/31/kennedy-center-board-trustees-bylaws/">according to the Washington Post.</a></p>

      <p>Fifty-two black bears were killed in three-week hunt state officials said was necessary to reduce ursine population</p>
<p>Wildlife officials in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a> say the slaughter of dozens of black bears during a controversial three-week hunt this month was a success, despite the opposition of protesters who condemned the “heartbreaking, bloody spectacle”.</p>
<p>The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) on Tuesday announced that <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLFFWCC/bulletins/4021dea?reqfrom=share">52 bears were killed</a> between 6 and 28 December, and promised to release a “full harvest report” in the coming months that will provide details about where and how the animals died.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Costs, insurance delays and difficult-to-obtain mental health treatment plague the US health system</p>
<p>A record 23 % of Americans believe the United States <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> system is “in a state of crisis” and 47% think it has “major problems,” according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/699770/cost-leads-americans-top-mind-healthcare-concerns.aspx">a recent</a> poll from the West Health-Gallup Center on Healthcare in America.</p>
<p>The poll also revealed that a record 29% of Americans see “cost” as the most urgent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">health</a> problem facing the US. Experts note that these two perceptions – that the healthcare system is in a state of crisis and that costs are an urgent health problem – are related.</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Enhanced subsidies for health insurance policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are set to expire at the end of today. That means skyrocketing premiums for some Obamacare enrollees. Premiums are expected to more than double, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, and some healthier people are expected to drop their insurance. Plus, 2025 was the year that generative AI exploded, divided, and created trust issues. We'll take a look back.</p>

<p>Campfires that once defined summer trips were never lit due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires">wildfire</a> risks. There were no bites where fish were once abundant, forests turned to meadows after a big burn and childhood memories of winter wonderlands turned to slush.</p>

      <p>People who are in default on their federal student loans could start seeing their wages garnished in the new year. Next week, the Department of Education plans to start sending out letters to borrowers who have missed at least nine months of payments, letting them know the government will begin taking 15% from their paychecks. Also, the U.S. Mint pressed the final batch of pennies last month. We examine the penny's 232-year run.</p>

      <h1>A whiplash year for electric vehicles</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>2025 brought some new speed bumps for electric vehicle sales, namely the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It cut federal EV tax credits — up to <span class="math inline">\(7,500 for new cars and \)</span>4,000 for used ones. Those incentives had been on the books in some form since 2008 and were expanded during the Biden administration. They expired at the end of September.</p>
<p>Consumers rushed to take advantage before they disappeared, leading to <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/">record high sales</a> earlier this year. But now the market faces an uncertain road ahead.</p>
<p>Marketplace's Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with her colleague Henry Epp about the outlook for EV sales in the U.S. now that federal tax credits are gone.</p>

      <h1>Life after LeBron James: who will inherit the NBA’s future?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>As the millennial superstars near the end, an international generation reshapes the league. The question is whether an American can still carry the crown</p>
<p>That the NBA is reckoned in seasons is apt. To measure a legacy this way is as much existential as it is symbolic. Martin Heidegger argued that time is not something we pass through, but the condition of our being – less a pathway than a pressure. Heavy stuff, yes, but the NBA has always operated under similar weight.</p>
<p>The millennial superstars who stabilized the league for two decades are now entering their twilight: LeBron James (who turned 41 on Tuesday), Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul. In their wake comes something genuinely new. For the first time, the league’s next dominant generation is unmistakably international. The NBA’s gen Z elite now emerge from Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Canada and France.</p>

      <p>Officials claim to find ‘rampant fraud’ in childcare funding, but prosecutions began in Biden era and Tim Walz says ‘we’ve spent years cracking down on it’</p>
<p>The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it is freezing federal funding for childcare programs in Minnesota after allegations of fraud – first exposed and prosecuted during the Biden administration – recently became the focus of conservative influencers and media outlets.</p>
<p>Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, said in <a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2006136004294664464">a video statement</a> that the funding freeze was in response to what he called “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country … We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud.”</p>

      <h1>National Guard arrives in New Orleans for 1st New Year’s since Bourbon Street attack</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Nearly a year after a New Year's Day truck attack on Bourbon Street left 14 dead, New Orleans officials are still seeking permanent security solutions. Ahead of the anniversary of the rampage, officials are ramping up security measures. Some 350 National Guard members arrived Tuesday. The attack happened when a man plowed a truck into revelers before police shot and killed him. The rampage revealed security vulnerabilities surrounding a famous street that is densely populated by bars and pedestrians. A police captain has urged the city to install permanent security gates to prevent future attacks.</p>

<p>A series of December storms delivered a welcome boost to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a>’s snowpack, scientists said on Tuesday in a closely watched assessment of the state’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water">water</a> resources for the year ahead.</p>
<p>The snowpack survey recorded a snow depth of 24in (61cm), said Angelique Fabbiani-Leon, state hydrometeorologist at the California department of water resources’ snow surveys and water supply forecasting unit. The survey was conducted at the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range that covers the eastern part of the state.</p>

      <p>Home price growth is cooling, new reports show. Though homeowners may be struggling to sell at asking price, it is good news for prospective buyers. Especially those who’ve been waiting on the sidelines for a good deal. But, as with most housing issues, the slowdown is regional. Also in this episode: Auto sales were strong in 2025, Gen Zers see cash in a new light, and an unlikely government funds a U.S.-based GED program for Mexican immigrants.</p>

<p>Another year has passed, and with it, another collection of Elon Musk’s ambitious timelines that didn’t quite align with reality. For those of us who have been following Tesla for years, this pattern is all too familiar. 2025 was billed as a year of massive expansion, widespread autonomy, and humanoid robots.</p>
<p>Now that the year is pretty much in the rearview mirror, let’s take a look at Musk’s top 5 Tesla predictions that missed the mark.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Lawyers for Brian Cole argue he should be released ahead of trial for allegedly planting devices in DC in 2021</p>
<p>The man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the headquarters of both the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> national committees the night before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach">January 6 insurrection</a> at the US Capitol appeared at a federal detention hearing before a magistrate judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, authorities arrested Brian Cole Jr of Woodbridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a>. He has yet to enter a plea. Cole’s lawyers argued that he should be released while he awaits trial, as he does not present any danger. They also noted that Cole had agreed to home detention enforced by GPS monitoring, and would live under the supervision of a relative. The defense rebuked federal prosecutors who pushed for the suspect to remain in custody.</p>

<p>Mamdani, 34, plans to take the oath of office on New Year’s Eve in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train. The unusual choice of venue for the ceremony, Mamdani said, is symbolically resonant of the “inauguration of a new era”.</p>

<p>A wild winter storm brought strong winds, heavy snow and frigid temperatures to the Great Lakes and north-east on Tuesday, a day after a bomb cyclone barreled across the midwest and left tens of thousands of customers without power.</p>
<p>The storm hit parts of the Plains and Great Lakes on Monday with sharply colder air, strong winds and a mix of snow, ice and rain, leading to treacherous travel. Forecasters said it intensified quickly enough to meet the criteria of a bomb cyclone, a system that strengthens rapidly as pressure drops.</p>

      <h1>A housing roundup and lookahead</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>This morning, we're recapping the 2025 housing market, which was — in a word — sluggish. Even though mortgage rates have come down, affordability remains an issue, and many would-be sellers are locked into ultra-low rates. But economists and real estate agents expect some modest pickup in the year ahead. Then, there's renewed focus on the vulnerability of the global auto supply chain after hackers targeted Jaguar Land Rover in September.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration is pledging $2 billion in humanitarian aid to the United Nations. The official State Department announcement of the U.N. donation says it “reaffirms the United States’ ironclad commitment to supporting critical life-saving humanitarian action around the world,” but the last paragraph warns that the UN has to reduce bureaucratic overhead.

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Annual inflation in Iran is running at more than 40%, and business owners are angry at the rapid devaluation of the nation's currency, in part due to the pressure of Western sanctions. In response, shopkeepers in the capital, Tehran, have been demonstrating for a third successive day. Plus, this year's hack at British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover showed just how vulnerable the global auto supply chain could be.</p>

      <h1>Online school and junior tennis: freedom, focus – and a quiet cost</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Elite junior tennis players are flocking to online schools. The model offers flexibility and focus – but raises deeper questions about growth, pressure and childhood</p>
<p>In a major study <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html">released recently in Epidemiology</a>, conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.</p>
<p>Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building. I often find myself bonding with the few other parents whose kids remain in regular school as we’re a rapidly dwindling species.</p>

      <h1>‘Be fearful when others are greedy’: Warren Buffett’s sharpest lessons in investing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals</p>
<p>Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway">who is retiring at the end of 2025</a>, has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.</p>
<p>Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with <span class="math inline">\(25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than \)</span>1tn.</p>
<p>Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.</p>
<p>My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).</p>
<p>Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’</p>
<p>When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.</p>
<p>Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)</p>
<p>In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.</p>
<p>Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.</p>
<p>From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.</p>
<p>When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend <em>my</em> 100th.</p>
<p>She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)</p>
<p>The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.</p>
<p>(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)</p>

      <p>Israeli prime minister said he will award Trump with Israel prize, highest civilian honor, while visiting Mar-a-Lago</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has warned that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> will have “hell to pay” if it fails to disarm while offering full-throated support to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister in Florida.</p>
<p>In a bravura display of mutual admiration, Netanyahu announced that the US president would be awarded the Israel prize, the country’s highest civilian honour, which since its inception in the 1950s has never before been given to a non-Israeli person.</p>

      <h1>Trump says ‘there’ll be hell to pay’ if Hamas does not disarm as he meets Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago – as it happened</h1>

<p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> is expected to tell <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on Monday that <strong>Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented</strong>, Israeli officials and analysts say.</p>
<p>The trip comes amid a <strong>new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel</strong> to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, which began in October after two years of devastating war.</p>
<p>He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.</p>
<p>Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the [Trump] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official</p>
<p>The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.</p>

<p>We talk all about the whys and hows behind the all-electric Dodge Charger failing to light up the sales boards the way it lit up its rear tires, but with a base price around $60,000 it hardly seemed to matter — now that Dodge dealers are slashing prices by nearly 50%, however, is this retro EV finally worth a look?</p>

<p>Another year and <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/01/01/starting-today-california-is-coming-for-your-e-bike-throttles/">another set</a> of e-bike restrictions. California riders are about to see some notable changes, as several new e-bike and electric motorcycle laws are set to take effect next week. Beginning January 1, 2026, a package of safety-focused regulations will officially go live, aimed at addressing the rapid growth of electric micromobility across the state.</p>

<p>We talk a lot here at <em>Electrek</em> about the exponential growth of electric vehicles and the massive strain that puts on the battery supply chain. Literally, the majority of that demand and production comes from China.</p>
<p>But there is a massive difference between <em>processing</em> materials and actually having them in the ground.</p>
<p>A new image from a gigantic materials mining and recycling company in China, gives us a sobering look at the reality of their domestic reserves. The data suggests that China’s own supply of the most critical battery metals isn’t just running low; in some cases, it’s already gone.</p>

      <p>Erica Fox’s remains were found after nearly weeklong search, marking a rare shark-related fatality for California</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> firefighters have found the body of a California triathlete on a beach north-west of Santa Cruz, almost a week after she went missing amid speculation that she was killed by a shark.</p>
<p>The remains of Erica Fox were found on Saturday, her father and husband <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/body-found-california-coast-triathlete-went-missing-shark-sighting-rcna251171">confirmed</a> to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/28/lovers-point-shark-attack-victim-identified-by-watch-shark-band-on-ankle/?clearUserState=true">local news</a> outlets. Fox, 55, was part of a group of more than a dozen swimmers who left from Lovers Point near Monterey, California, on 21 December, but she never returned to shore. A witness driving by the area reported to authorities that they saw a shark with what appeared to be a human body in its mouth emerge from the water, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/swimmer-missing-pacific-grove-identified-21259455.php">according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.</p>

      <h1>Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites may have been filled with toxic dirt</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Toxic chemicals like lead and asbestos are likely in dirt used to backfill demolished structures in city, experts say</p>
<p>Hundreds of Detroit home demolition sites were <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2025/12/22/toxic-dirt-detroitland-bank-cleanup/87881313007/">potentially backfilled</a> with toxic construction debris from a demolished shopping mall and other sources, creating an unfolding public health threat in the city’s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Detroit, the nation’s lowest income big city, is in the US industrial heartland. It was left with tens of thousands of empty structures as industrial plants closed and people left the city in past decades – Detroit’s population dropped from nearly 2 million people around 1950 to fewer than 700,000 today. The city’s demolition program is widely considered the largest ever in the US.</p>

      <h1>The Las Vegas Raiders and the thin line between tanking and incompetence</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas shut down their two stars, angered their leader and were humiliated by the Giants. Whether it’s strategy or dysfunction, the result looks the same</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders made waves this week by putting its two, and only, stars on injured reserve ahead of the final two games that will decide the 2026 NFL draft order. Tight end Brock Bowers and edge rusher Maxx Crosby were shut down from a consequential battle for the top draft pick against the Giants and a Week 18 game against Kansas City due to nagging knee injuries. Bowers had scored four touchdowns over the past five weeks for a team that doesn’t score many points. Crosby is a human wrecking ball who has amassed 28 tackles for loss this season. He’s the player that causes opponents to lose sleep. Both Bowers and Crosby were recently named to the Pro Bowl despite their nagging injuries. Bowers stepped away quietly. Crosby did not.</p>
<p>A fuming Crosby left the Raiders facility Friday. The next day he <a href="https://x.com/MLFootball/status/2005116248653447578?s=20">sent a message to the organization</a> by posting videos of himself playing basketball with his young daughter. He did not appear particularly injured.</p>

(date: 2025-12-29)

      <p>Other outlets have asked their writers to compromise, but the Guardian has never – and would never – ask me to pull a punch</p>

<p>It might be most generous to characterize the behavior of major US media organizations since 2024 as negotiating between competing incentives.</p>
<p>On the one hand, billionaires have consolidated their ownership over major news outlets and platforms. The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.</p>

<p>A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped.

      <h1>Why haven’t Trump’s tariffs crashed the US economy? | Jeffrey Frankel</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Effects on inflation and employment have not been as bad as feared – but could still materialise with full force in 2026</p>
<p>When Donald Trump took office last January, most economists feared what would happen if he raised tariffs. The expectation was that, as the new duties drove up prices of consumer goods and inputs – affecting households and companies, respectively – surging inflation and falling real incomes would follow. This would be a supply shock, so the US Federal Reserve could not do much to counteract it.</p>
<p>Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violating <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250318_Trump-and-the-World-Economy.pdf?x85095">international</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9ggbn0dgp37jkknk0rxpu/2025-05-13-Jeffrey-Frankel-Taking-a-Sledgehammer-to-US-Global-Leadership-Trump-s-Tariffs.mp4?rlkey=9iw66ek8uh5kyqwnf59ptt6qr&amp;e=2&amp;st=s51qydmr&amp;dl=0ido">agreements</a> and blowing up the Republican party’s <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans">oft-professed</a> commitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of his <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trump-tariffs-economic-cost-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-05">first term</a>, and even beyond the infamous <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm">Smoot-Hawley Act</a> of 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025">average effective tariff</a> on US imports rose from <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/">2% to 18%</a>, the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and large <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trumps-tariffs-cause-recession-experts/story?id=120329597">adverse</a> effects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.</p>

<p>A lot of mainstream auto media coverage right now is pushing the idea that some EVs are “dying.” What we’re <em>really</em> seeing is a wave of end-of-cycle, first-generation vehicles making way for their next-gen replacements — and, historically, that’s when buyers get the best deals.</p>
<p>If that’s what <em>you’re</em> after, these are the EVs you should be looking at right now.</p>

      <h1>‘Just like so many families’: US parents of addicted kids relate to the Reiners – but fear stigma</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>The challenges of drug and alcohol addiction are familiar, but violence against others is highly unusual, parents say</p>
<p>When news broke that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been killed and a possible suspect was their son, Nick Reiner, who had struggled with addiction and mental health issues, it brought addiction back into the public spotlight. But parents who have been affected by their children’s addiction fear the conversation will focus on the exceedingly rare act of violence instead of the more widespread risks.</p>
<p>Ron Grover and his wife, Darlene, have been glued to the news. They only knew the Reiners by their work, but they feel a connection: Grover’s son also became addicted at 15 to opioids and then heroin, much like Nick Reiner, and he was in and out of rehab and jail for years. But after seven excruciating years, Grover’s son got sober in July 2010.</p>

      <p>Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes</p>
<p>Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.</p>
<p>Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.</p>
<p>57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.</p>

      <p>The progressive party is now active in 18 states and much of its expansion happened in the past five years</p>
<p>The “time has come” for the Working Families party, the progressive third party’s national director said after a year of big wins and a growing hunger among voters for a home outside the two major political parties.</p>
<p>“For 26 years, we’ve been building this argument,” Maurice Mitchell said. “And the argument has met the moment.”</p>

      <p>This year turned out to be a pretty big year for autonomous vehicles. Waymo is the leader in the robotaxi race and over the last year, its signature Jaguar electric vehicles have become a common sight on the streets and recently freeways of cities around the country.</p>
<p>Companies like Uber and Zooks have expanded their fleets to several metropolitan areas. And Tesla finally rolled out its cybercab service in a limited capacity in Austin.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke to Kirsten Korosec, transportation editor at TechCrunch, about how the robotaxi became a common fixture on city streets this year.</p>

      <p>Extraordinary golf was often overshadowed by Donald Trump, colourful fans, crazy MCs and tempers flaring</p>
<p>I was out by the practice green late afternoon on the Monday of the Ryder Cup and so was Bryson DeChambeau. He was on his own, signing autographs for the handful of people on the other side of the railings, and there was this one woman leaning over towards him, a bottle blonde, late middle-aged, in a tight white dress.</p>
<p>She was only a couple of feet away from him, but she was screaming in his ear like she was trying to reach someone across the far side of the course. “We love you Bryson! Bryson! We love you! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald! We love you for everything you’ve done for the Donald!”</p>

And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.</p>

<p>In the world of professional hockey, the only thing that might be more iconic than the legendary Stanley Cup might be the Zamboni – the mighty ice-smoothing machines that keep the rink fast, flawless, and game-ready. And, thanks to battery power, today’s Zambonis can do the job more quietly, cleanly, and efficiently than ever.</p>

(date: 2025-12-28)
      <p>
      <p>As the US faces challenges to public school funding, activists warn that more people should pay attention to what’s happened in Inglewood, California</p>
<p>Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.</p>
<p>By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome. When the 2028 Olympics roll around, Inglewood is slated to host many of the events as the world watches.</p>

<p>A man in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.</p>
<p>As told in court documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138">NBC News</a>, the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely. Adams’s back yard was not equipped to stop bullets from leaving the property and striking unsuspecting people in the surrounding area, according to authorities.</p>

But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.</p>
<p>One diagnosis, however, drew striking consensus: Democrats had allowed themselves to be drowned out online by the right’s vast – and well-funded – digital army.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 years ago, a 13-year-old boarded a tiny fishing boat from communist Vietnam with more than a hundred other people. His intended destination: anywhere but there. The boat drifted through the Pacific Ocean for three days and four nights, dodging violent storms,massive waves, even a pirating ship. For the entirety of the journey, the teenager had no food or water.</p>
<p>He survived the voyage, later took shelter in a Malaysian refugee camp, and was eventually granted asylum in the United States.</p>

<p>In what appears to be significant strategic pivot, Samsung SDI will begin supplying prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems under a fresh US contract worth more than 2 trillion won (~$1.35 billion). The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.</p>

      <p>The California Democrat believes common ground does not only lie in the center – and has the successes to prove it</p>
<p>It was mid-December, and Ro Khanna was watching the calendar. The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed. And when the deadline arrived, while the justice department didn’t release everything, thousands of new files, connections and photographs began to complete the picture on what Khanna calls “the Epstein class … rich and powerful men who still have buildings named after them, who still are on corporations, are still in positions of prestige, who engage in heinous conduct.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine. From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> – to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.</p>

      <p>Crisis intervention training helps police recognize substance use disorders and connect people with treatment</p>
<p>Overdoses have been declining nationally since the fall of 2023, and public health experts have been unable to agree as to why. The decline has been uneven across states, and West Virginia, long known as the epicenter of the opioid crisis, is also among the states that have most reduced overdose fatalities, as noted in a recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis">Guardian</a> analysis.</p>
<p>One little explored factor is the increased adoption of crisis intervention training (CIT) for law enforcement. Early <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11772998/pdf/qxaf003.pdf">research that compares jurisdictions</a> that have CIT programs to those that do not show that this intervention is associated with a decline in overdose fatalities.</p>

<p>The US economy is thriving, according to Donald Trump: jobs are surging, prices are falling, wages are soaring. The government’s own official statistics paint a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/20/trump-us-economy">more complicated picture</a> of 2025.</p>

      <h1>Winter weather disrupts air traffic in New Jersey and New York</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Nearly 15,000 flights canceled or delayed as both states declare weather emergencies after snowstorm</p>
<p>A mix of snow and ice bore down on the US north-east early on Saturday, disrupting post-holiday weekend airline traffic and prompting officials in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> to issue weather emergency declarations even as the storm ebbed by mid-morning.</p>
<p>More than 14,400 domestic US flights on Saturday were canceled or delayed as of mid-morning, with the majority in the New York area, including at John F Kennedy international airport, LaGuardia airport and Newark Liberty international airport, according to the tracking site FlightAware.</p>

      <h1>Trump urges Republicans to ditch filibuster rule in US Senate</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Rule allows minority party to block legislation, but GOP is reluctant to scrap it as they could lose majority</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has floated the idea of ending the filibuster – a procedural technique in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a> that allows a minority of senators to block legislation from passing – which would make pushing through his political agenda in 2026 much easier.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/trump-to-politico-midterm-elections-will-be-about-pricing-00706877">Politico</a>, the president urged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> to scrap the filibuster, saying it had become an obstacle to effective governing and removing it would prevent another government shutdown and pave the way for his party to push through its legislative priorities.</p>

      <h1>Clergy abuse survivors frustrated by New Orleans archdiocese’s protracted bankruptcy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Long-winded legal wrangling and recalcitrant Catholic church leadership thwarted hopes for timely settlement</p>
<p>An image of his great-grandmother stayed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/new-orleans-clergy-abuse-survivors-judge">James Adams</a> for years and strengthened his faith: she was withered, nearly blind, touching his cheeks when they sat together, as if the feel of his face gave her sight. A working woman whose husband, a police officer, killed himself, she raised four children; her faith was a rock against life’s travails. She died at 98, when Adams was 28, about to marry.</p>
<p>Many years later, in 2020, Adams, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> banker, was president of the Catholic Community Foundation, the archdiocese’s fundraising arm, when Archbishop Gregory Aymond ousted him – as he’s recounted from a witness stand in court and in multiple media interviews. Overnight, Adams became a church enemy because of what a priest did to him as a boy. His story mirrors the legal saga that has tarnished Aymond’s career.</p>

<p>A California family is celebrating their first holiday following the delivery of their latest child, a baby that had been growing outside of the mother’s womb.</p>
<p>Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old emergency room nurse in Bakersfield, California, delivered baby Ryu via surgery in August, so the newborn is celebrating his first Christmas. He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.</p>

      <h1>Inflatable frogs and ice scrapers: nine innovative ways Americans protested against Trump in 2025</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Historically, when organizers have used tactical innovation, movement activity has peaked</p>
<p>Federal agents in military fatigues carrying assault rifles in major cities. Huge cuts to healthcare, science and the US’s largest anti-hunger <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/snap-funding-cuts-threaten-food-security-health/">program</a>. Immigrants dragged from cars and courthouse hallways. Rising authoritarianism, corruption and anti-democratic behavior. These are just some of the reasons pushback against the Trump administration is growing with each passing day.</p>
<p>While traditional marches such as the massive <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o">No Kings</a> protests are a critical part of any resistance movement, sociologist Doug McAdam has shown how <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095322">tactical innovation</a> – the introduction of creative or novel protest methods – was a key part of the success of the civil rights movement in the US. Historically, when organizers established new tactics, movement activity peaked.</p>

      <p>Drummer Chuck Redd decided to cancel his yearly Jazz Jam after Donald Trump added his name to the venue</p>
<p>The president of the Kennedy Center has demanded $1m in damages and fiercely criticized a musician’s sudden decision to cancel a Christmas Eve performance at the venue days after the White House announced that Donald Trump’s name would be added to the facility.</p>
<p>“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.</p>

      <h1>The ascendant San Antonio Spurs are the gift the NBA needed</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>By puncturing Oklahoma City’s aura of inevitability, Victor Wembanyama and co have restored suspense, drama and joy to a season that was in danger of becoming dull</p>
<p>I’ve seen enough: Give the San Antonio Spurs the keys to Santa Claus’ workshop. Put Stephon Castle in charge of toy assembly. Let De’Aaron Fox toss presents into chimneys, from whatever range he’d like. Devin Vassell can customize the Christmas cookies. Harrison Barnes has the army of elves covered. And, of course, Santa Claus’s sleigh must immediately be resized for a taller, thinner pilot so that the towering Victor Wembanyama can drive it comfortably. The sensational Spurs have felled the Oklahoma City Thunder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/nba-christmas-games-scores">three times in two weeks</a>, and in doing so revitalized this NBA season. I now have more faith in the Spurs’ ability to grant joy to the masses than any holiday legends of old.</p>
<p>It looked dire for a while there. The Thunder might have won the Larry O’Brien trophy in June, but began this season in even more ominous form. They reeled off 24 wins in their first 25 games (the lone loss was a fluky 20-point comeback). In most of them, Jalen Williams, their second-best player, was on the sidelines recovering from wrist surgery. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, their best, seldom had to play in fourth quarters. The Thunder beat the Sacramento Kings by 31. The Los Angeles Lakers, who some expected to be a plausible rival, lost by 29; their basketball savant Luka Doncic looked like he was playing against ten men. The Phoenix Suns’ valiant first earned them a close loss, by just four points. When they met again 12 days later, the Thunder won by 49. This game knocked all the remaining leaves off the trees and started winter 10 days ahead of schedule. Oklahoma City looked capable of shredding anything in its path, even the 2016 Golden State Warriors’ legendary regular season record of 73-9.</p>

      <h1>Epstein texts and yelling at Trump: US House’s year of censures</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>Lawmakers spent much of 2025 seeking to reprimand each other – here’s a look back at what sparked such outrage</p>
<p>It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives. Lawmakers broke the record for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/hakeem-jeffries-house-speech-trump-tax-bill">longest floor speech</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/17/house-breaks-longest-vote-record-genius-act">longest vote</a>, and presided over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">the lengthiest government shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>They also spent plenty of time seeking to reprimand each other by passing censures, as the House’s formal mechanism for discipline is known. A search on Congress.gov reveals at least 17 attempts since the start of the year to condemn another lawmaker, in the form of a censure or a less formal disapproval resolution.</p>

<p>Thomas Massie then successfully sought donations for his run for another term in the 2026 midterm elections against an opponent that Trump – his fellow Republican – has already endorsed.</p>

<p>Whittingham, 66, has agreed to a five-year deal that is expected to be formally announced later on Friday, ESPN’s Pete Thamel and Dan Wetzel reported. The move comes weeks after Whittingham stepped down from his long-held position at Utah, where he spent 21 seasons as head coach and became the most successful figure in the program’s history.</p>

<p>Anime had a big year in 2025. The animated film “KPop Demon Hunters” broke Netflix’s record for most-watched movie on the streaming platform. And “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle&quot; became the top-grossing international film ever at the North American box office. When “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” debuted in theaters earlier this year, Kimberly spoke with Crunchyroll’s executive vice president of global commerce Mitchel Berger about the strategy behind the film’s release and the future of anime content.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Every Sunday, protesters from Florida and beyond go to the notorious immigration jail and advocate for its closure</p>
<p>They come on buses, in cars and RVs. Some ride on motorcycles. Every Sunday afternoon, convoys of protesters from all over Florida, and others from out of state, descend on the notorious “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/trump-alligator-alcatraz-florida">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigration jail in the Everglades to stand vigil for those held inside.</p>
<p>It is a ritual that began in August, a month after the opening of the remote detention camp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-alligator-alcatraz-immigration-florida">celebrated by Donald Trump</a> for its harsh conditions, and hailed by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, as a model for the president’s aggressive detention and deportation agenda.</p>

      <h1>The end of 'de minimis' exemption, four months on</h1>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>The &quot;de minimis&quot; tax exemption on packages under $800 shipped to the U.S. came to an end in August. It's a move that's boosted business for logistics companies but has hit some smaller businesses at home and abroad hard. This morning, we'll learn outline the effects the change has had. Also on this morning’s show: an Nvidia licensing deal and the factors driving up precious metal prices.</p>

<p>It’s official. The word “sustainable” is gone from Tesla’s mission statement.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Tesla’s guiding star was arguably the most impactful corporate mission statement of the 21st century. But over the last few years, we have watched the company slowly drift away from its environmental roots.</p>
<p>Now, Elon Musk has confirmed the final step in that divorce, rebranding the company’s goal from “Sustainable Abundance” to simply “Amazing Abundance.”</p>

      <p>Fiber artists across the US are using their craft to protest against everything from national guard deployments to rollbacks on abortion rights</p>
<p>In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”.</p>

      <p>Now that Christmas presents are unwrapped, many of you — you know who you are — will head to stores to return gifts and get what you actually want. But increasingly, retailers are charging for those returns. Then, a couple of months ago, more than 5 million shoppers embraced a boycott of three major retailers: Amazon, Home Depot, and Target.

      <p>The president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmed</p>

<p>But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv">The Apprentice</a>, appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.</p>

      <p>Texas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSD</p>
<p>For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.</p>
<p>Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>New polling shows 65% of registered US voters believe global heating is affecting cost of living</p>
<p>Most Americans now connect the worsening climate crisis with their cost of living pressures, with clear majorities also disagreeing with moves by the Trump administration to gut climate research and halt windfarms, new polling has found.</p>
<p>About 65% of registered voters in the US think that global heating is affecting the cost of living, <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-politics-policy-fall-2025/?">according to the polling by Yale University</a>.</p>

      <h1>The year tariffs upended global trade</h1>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> There's one word that's dominated the headlines this year: tariffs. Countries around the world have been grappling with the U.S. import taxes central to President Donald Trump's trade policy, so how are countries faring? We check in on Mexico, China, and others. Plus, the Trump administration eliminated the tax exemption for parcels under $800 this year. We investigate how the move is playing out four months on.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>After the writers’ and actors’ strikes, the pandemic, and structural shifts in technology, LA’s trying to find its footing in a changed industry</p>
<p>The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.</p>
<p>It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.</p>

      <p>
      <p>When Trump began deploying troops to US cities, Janessa Goldbeck’s Vet Voice Foundation was ready – now they’re preparing for what may be next</p>
<p>Whatever the worst-case scenario, <a href="https://vvfnd.org/about/our-team/">Janessa Goldbeck</a> has probably imagined it. In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup. Last year she advised local leaders on the hypothetical of troops being deployed to their streets for immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>Then Donald Trump won and Goldbeck’s nightmare came true.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has said the US carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in north-west Nigeria on Thursday, after weeks of decrying the group for targeting Christians. Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the onslaught was part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups. 'This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria through airstrikes in the north-west,' the ministry said in a post on X</p>

<p>Today we’re diving into the business of music. Trapital founder Dan Runcie joins Kimberly to explain what Anthropic’s recent copyright settlement with authors could mean for record labels who’ve sued AI companies, the “fair use” debates dominating the music industry, and why even the biggest stars are struggling to create chart-toppers these days. Plus, we’ll celebrate a win from one of our listeners.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Imran Ahmed, an anti-disinformation advocate, claims he is being targeted for scrutinising social media companies</p>
<p>A British anti-disinformation campaigner close to Keir Starmer’s chief of staff has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration after being told he could face deportation from the US in a row over freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), has filed a complaint against senior Trump allies including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, in an attempt to prevent what he says would be an unconstitutional arrest and removal.</p>

      <p>Are her recent candid remarks about Trump an attempt to distance herself from an increasingly unpopular president?</p>
<p>She was now one of the family. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> addressed supporters in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in early December, <a href="https://x.com/josh_wingrove/status/1998551432350544325?s=20">he asked</a>: “Susie Trump – do you know Susie Trump? Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles.”</p>
<p>The US president was referring to his chief of staff, who he said had persuaded him to return to the campaign trail ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. But a week later, Wiles appeared at risk of becoming the family outcast.</p>

<p>Trump’s first and second terms have been marked by huge protests, from the 2017 Women’s March to the protests for racial justice after George Floyd’s murder, to this year’s No Kings demonstrations.

<p>According to historians and political scientists who study protest: very. From emancipation to women’s suffrage, from civil rights to Black Lives Matter, mass movement has shaped the arc of American history. Protest has led to the passage of legislation that gave women the right to vote, banned segregation and legalized same-sex marriage. It has also sparked cultural shifts in how Americans perceive things like bodily autonomy, economic inequality and racial bias.</p>

      <h1>I was there: Rory McIlroy’s Masters triumph was the ultimate moment</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>It felt like nothing would top Tiger Woods’s Masters win, but then the Northern Irishman completed his career grand slam on an extraordinary final day at Augusta</p>
<p>At 7am on 14 April in an Augusta rental home, Rory McIlroy awoke and immediately spotted a Green Jacket draped over a chair. “You think: ‘Yeah, that did happen yesterday,’” he says. “That.” McIlroy was now the sixth man to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/14/rory-mcilroy-secures-career-grand-slam-after-dramatic-masters-playoff-win-over-justin-rose">win all four of golf’s majors</a>.</p>
<p>The detail of what lay around in the bedroom of my own Augusta billet is of no interest to anybody. That was, however, a memorable morning. I had previously and wrongly believed nothing would top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/14/masters-tiger-woods-molinari-finau-schauffele-koepka">Tiger Woods’s 2019 Masters win</a> in respect of seismic reaction. Scores of messages from friends, colleagues, family members – umpteen of whom have no interest whatsoever in golf – had landed. Broadcast outlets across the world wanted my assessment of what had played out on Masters Sunday. Yeah, that did happen yesterday.</p>

But that isn’t likely to signal a full job market turnaround in the new year.

      <p>More than a year after the storm ripped apart families and farms, growers are bullish about strength of their industry</p>
<p>Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year’s devastating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a>, but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we’re in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.</p>

<p>Happy holidays! Across the 12 days of Christmas one very keen individual once gifted their lover a partridge in a pear tree, two turtle doves, three French hens, four calling birds, five gold rings, six geese a-laying, seven swans a-swimming, eight maids a-milking, nine ladies dancing, 10 lords a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming.</p>
<p>An extravagant expression of what was allegedly “true love”, the spree amounted to a total of 364 presents – more if you include the eggs that the geese a-laid.</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>2025 has been the year of getting dragged back to the office for plenty of workers — some part-time, but many full-time in the case of big finance and tech corporations. Thing is, in-person work appeals to many younger workers. Today, we'll hear the perspective of one. Then, the State Department says it will deny visas to five European citizens, including a former top EU official, and domestic production is still adjusting to tariffs.</p>

      <h1>Fresh ‘manty’ and cheap figs: a post-Soviet supermarket becomes a must-visit spot in NYC</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone</p>
<p>When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like <em>manty</em> – intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or <em>chak-chak</em>, a dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey syrup. <em>Kompot,</em> too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.</p>
<p>Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home. <em>Manty</em> was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin, yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade <em>kompot</em> with fruits and berries from our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered <em>chak-chak</em>, the store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find <em>plov</em> and <em>samsas</em> at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.</p>

<p>Republicans are attempting to exempt some major polluters from paying for Pfas “forever chemical” cleanup. If successful, it could mark a major setback in US effort to rein in Pfas pollution.</p>
<p>The Republican-led House energy and commerce committee recently <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/environment-subcommittee-holds-hearing-on-the-current-statutory-and-regulatory-landscape-of-pfas">held a hearing</a> at which it invited representatives from the water treatment and landfill industries, among others, to make the case about why they should be exempted from rules that hold polluters financially accountable for the cleanup of two types of dangerous Pfas.</p>

      <p>Critics compare offensive to Iraq war, citing familiar mix of regime-change rhetoric, security pretexts and oil interests</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, <a href="https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430">invoking</a> drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>Police say municipal staff inspected the site and found the trees were left standing but had been cut around their bases, likely with a chainsaw. Many of the trees that were cut were older-growth Douglas fir trees, valuable to the community and ecosystem.</p>

      <h1>Trump approves deployment of 350 national guard members to New Orleans</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Critics say deployment is unwarranted and could cause fear in the city, which has seen a decrease in violent crime rates</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is deploying 350 national guard troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> ahead of the new year, launching another federal deployment in the city at the same time that an immigration crackdown led by border patrol is under way.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February.</p>

      <h1>Is Trump mentally OK? A look back at the president’s unusual behavior in 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity</p>
<p>In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408">claimed</a> that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.</p>
<p>“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.</p>
<p>America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”</p>
<p>I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.</p>
<p>We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”</p>

      <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore Homeland Security funding to 12 states and the District of Columbia.

Plus, food banks are bracing for strain ahead of changes to SNAP. We hear how services will be impacted on the ground in Kentucky.</p>

      <h1>Woman deported before she could see dying husband in ICE custody: ‘I never saw him again’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Francisco Gaspar-Andrés died in El Paso hospital after being detained at Fort Bliss – his wife was deported to Guatemala without a chance to see him</p>
<p>A Guatemalan man has become the first person to die in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention">Fort Bliss army base</a> in Texas. His wife of 25 years was deported from the same camp without a chance to see her dying husband.</p>
<p>Francisco Gaspar-Andrés, 48, died on 3 December at a hospital in El Paso, as Democratic lawmakers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> advocates were ramping up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/democrats-texas-immigration-jail">demands</a> that the camp be closed down <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/texas-ice-camp-abuse-immigration">amid allegations</a> of inhumane conditions there. The DHS has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/texas-ice-camp-abuse-immigration">said</a> such allegations are “categorically false”.</p>

      <p>Polystyrene is the chemical compound that makes up styrofoam, which is used for packaging and insulation. But it’s not the most environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>By one estimate, 40 million tons of polystyrene were produced globally in 2024, leaving millions of tons of plastic waste. The search for an earth-friendly alternative has led researchers to dig deep and come up with an unlikely solution: fungus. The BBC’s Anna Holligan has this story.</p>

<p>An Alberta chocolatier brought a distinctly Canadian flavour to the baking show Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking, a magical experience she says taught her to think bigger.

      <h1>How the Guardian reported 2025, with editor-in-chief Katharine Viner</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Katharine Viner</strong>, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells <strong>Annie Kelly</strong> what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.</p>
<p>In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’</p>
<p>It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even more</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>From the Super Bowl to UFC cards to the US Open to the Ryder Cup, the US president has turned sport into his own personal stage. There’s more to come</p>
<p>Considering he’s the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/donald-trump-hard-work">self-declared hardest working</a> president to ever hold the office, Donald Trump has spent a remarkable amount of the past year away from it. In 2025, he loomed over sports like no American politician before him, his visits to stadiums and arenas and golf courses and race tracks so frequent they began to feel like part of the job description. But if Trump’s presence on the sporting scene has seemed hard to escape, gird yourselves for 2026, when the American presidency no longer merely intersects with sport but threatens to subsume it. The World Cup is on the way, the Olympics are right behind it, a UFC card is coming to the White House lawn (not a joke) and the commander-in-chief’s well-documented fondness for jumbotrons is becoming less of a habit than a dependency.</p>
<p>Trump’s grand tour sportif began less than three weeks after his second inauguration, when he become the first sitting president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/08/super-bowl-trump-end-racism-politics">to attend the Super Bowl</a>. One week later he was at the Daytona 500, where Air Force One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FMzOKEKA4to">buzzed the speedway on arrival</a> before his armored limousine, “The Beast”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMNHoprgcAw">paced the field</a> for a couple of ceremonial laps.</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Portland Fire are set for their debut season in the WNBA. Their coach has completed an unlikely journey to the top of his sport</p>
<p>As an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved. For the British-born Sarama, who on 28 October was named the head coach of the WNBA’s newest expansion team, the Portland Fire, people doubted him before he even put two sentences together.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”</p>

      <h1>Medicaid paid more than $207 million for dead people. A new law could help fix that</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died. The inspector general report, released Tuesday, suggests that a new mandate in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill could help reduce these kind of payments. The bill requires states to audit Medicaid beneficiary lists against the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File. Privacy laws currently restrict access to this file. The report recommends states comply with the new mandate to conduct quarterly death checks to prevent further improper payments.</p>

      <p>From July through September, U.S. gross domestic product rose 4.3%, the highest in two years. At a time when many consumers are feeling economic pressure, higher earners and certain businesses are doing very well — and spending to match it. In this episode, can the impressive rate of growth continue?

</ul>
<p>In another released email exchange from November 2001, <strong>Ghislaine Maxwell</strong> appears to be organizing an instructor for <strong>Epstein</strong> who “ <strong>has to be female youngish and attractive otherwise he will lose interest rapidly</strong>”.</p>
<p>Maxwell emails someone called “Gibby”, saying: “JE is looking for an exercise instructor to work out with. He is looking for someone who can tone, flex and stretch.” “I am counting on you,” she adds.</p>
<p><strong>He likes, well you know what he likes.</strong></p>

      <h1>Trump administration bans US veterans agency from providing abortions</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>Department of Veterans Affairs says justice department found procedure not to be legally sound</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs can no longer provide abortions to veterans, including in cases of rape or incest, following a Department of Justice memo that found last week that the practice was not legally sound.</p>
<p>The ban follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VAto counsel veterans and their families about abortion, as well as offer the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy imperiled their health. In August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals">the administration filed paperwork</a> to officially roll back the policy, which had helped the VA’s network of 1,300-plus healthcare facilities – which treat nearly 10 million veterans each year – expand access to abortion, especially in the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade.</p>

<p>A drag queen Christmas tour has become an annual holiday tradition in Florida – and in recent years, so has the ensuing backlash.</p>
<p>Now in its 11th year, A Drag Queen Christmas, featuring performers from RuPaul’s Drag Race, will stop in the Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola on Tuesday night, despite state officials’ best efforts to cancel the show for what they claim is an “anti-Christian” performance at a city-owned theater.</p>

<p>If you’ve covered e-bikes as long as I have, you’ll know two things about them: they’re an awesome way to get around, and the basic technology behind an e-bike motor hasn’t radically changed in a long, long time. However, based on the new e-bike motor design I just tested from a powertrain technology company called <a href="https://www.chargebike.co/">CHARGE</a>, the e-bike world may be about to get turned on its head. These guys discovered that nearly any e-bike hub motor can perform regenerative braking, but everyone has just been building them wrong this whole time.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump</p>
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.</p>
<p>The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.</p>
<p>Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.</p>
<p>Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests">Multiple references to Donald Trump</a>, including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Files featuring redactions that were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media">found to be removable</a> through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.</p>

      <h1>‘Haunted and cursed’: Lake Lanier has a deadly reputation. A darker tale hides beneath the surface</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>After years of fatalities and bizarre incidents, the Georgia reservoir has spawned countless ghost stories. Are they merely legend or the aftereffects of a history steeped in racial trauma?</p>
<p>Kile Glover was the entertainer in the family, the pride of his stepfather, the R&amp;B superstar Usher. He sang, he danced – he burned CDs of his own music, styled the covers with self-made art and was otherwise expressing his creativity in internet videos before it was trendy. “He would’ve been a YouTube sensation by now,” says his mother, the celebrity stylist Tameka Foster. But that future was thwarted on a family trip to Lake Lanier, just outside his Atlanta home town, in July 2012.</p>
<p>Kile was only 11 when he was struck by a speeding jetski while tubing and knocked unconscious. Foster, on the island of Saint Martin at the time, managed to get to Kile’s hospital bedside within hours thanks to Usher sending a private plane – an olive branch that came amid a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tameka-raymond-ushers-status-helped-win-custody/story?id=19969051">bitterly public</a> custody battle over their two younger sons. As Kile lay on life support, Foster passed the time Googling for information about Lake Lanier. She is still horrified by what she learned.</p>

U.S. regulators have now approved a much less expensive alternative; Novo Nordisk has gotten the green light for an oral version of Wegovy. Pills are cheaper to manufacture than injectables, and that could be a game-changer.

      <p>US government continues holding on to massive amounts of seized personal property, from diaries to cellphones</p>
<p>Georgia’s historic racketeering case in connection with opposition to the police training center known as Cop City continues hanging over the heads of 61 defendants, drawing into focus the state’s continuing possession of hundreds of cellphones, laptops and personal items.</p>
<p>The state’s case is believed to be the largest ever leveled against a protest or social movement using Rico, a law created to go after the mafia and usually associated with organized crime but here deployed against a largely environmental and criminal justice-focused movement.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tech giant Amazon says it's blocked more than 1,800 North Koreans from trying to join the company in the past two years. Amazon's chief security officer said North Koreans often try to get hired, then send wages back to fund their government's weapons programs. Plus, &quot;oshikatsu&quot; is a Japanese term referring to fervent fan subcultures surrounding things like sports teams, pop stars, or anime — and it's helped pull Japanese retail sales out of a slump.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The number of people in immigration detention in the US has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration">hit an all-time high</a>, according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p><strong>What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?</strong> In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">no criminal record</a> continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)</p>
<p><strong>How are ordinary people fighting back?</strong> As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back">Julia Carrie Wong reports</a> on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.</p>
<p><strong>What did Trump say about Clinton?</strong> “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?</strong> The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action">a resolution</a> directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.</p>

      <p>
      <p>By representing its region’s distinct culture and players, the Canadian Premier League team aims to boost the province’s undoubted soccer potential</p>
<p>Boulevard Saint-Laurent is one of Montréal’s great arteries, a throughway for gourmands coveting smoked meat sandwiches or proper pizza at one of a dozen different joints in Little Italy. It’s also home to Evangelista Sports, a shop that has doubled as a shrine to the city’s soccer-obsessed for more than 40 years and is every bit a part of Montréal’s cultural fabric as poutine or lamenting the cold.</p>
<p>It’s also where FC Supra du Québec opted to announce their first-ever signings last week. The Canadian Premier League (CPL) expansion team is looking to become part of the city and province’s cultural identity, hoping their commitment to recruiting a full roster of Québec-born or raised players, inspired by European clubs like Athletic Bilbao, will go a long way in helping to build a pathway which has so often seen talent slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.</p>
<p>To review the year in tech and Trump we called up Suyash Pasi, a research analyst and editor at the nonprofit Human Rights Research Center, who’s been following this shift.</p>

<p>“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”</p>

<p>A school district board in upstate New York is investigating school officials amid accusations that the district may have confined elementary school students inside wooden “timeout” boxes.</p>
<p>Images of the boxes, which resemble tiny padded cells, first spread on social media last week, after a <a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/12/16/social-media-posts-about-wooden-box-mohawk-school-prompts-police-investigation/">former member of the Salmon River school district school board</a> accused officials of building them to seclude children with disabilities. The images unleashed an immediate uproar in the small district, which teaches about 1,300 children and lies on the border between New York state and Canada.</p>

      <h1>Feeding the Family</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>Hey Smarties! We’re dropping into your feeds today to share this special coverage from Marketplace.</p>
<p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants. We visit a refugee farmer in Houston, a chocolate-making lab in California, and stop for a bite at an award-winning restaurant in Portland.</p>

<p>CBS News was dealing with internal and external uproar on Monday after it pulled at the last minute an investigation for its flagship 60 Minutes show into the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2025/mar/20/cecot-el-salvador-venezuela-prison-trump-deportations">harsh prison in El Salvador</a> where the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans from the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The episode about the Cecot mega-prison was due to air on Sunday night. However, in an “editor’s note” <a href="https://x.com/60Minutes/status/2002854497685582309">posted on X</a> late that afternoon, the broadcaster’s official account announced that “the lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside Cecot’ will air in a future broadcast.”</p>

      <h1>Wolves’ freefall leaves even Derby’s dismal record low a lofty goal</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>A side that once looked resilient has collapsed into historic futility, with Wolves now facing the grim task of avoiding the worst season English league football has ever seen</p>
<p>Saturday’s defeat at home to Brentford means Wolves have taken just two points for 17 games. No side in the entire history of English league football, in any division, has ever made a worse start than that. To reach 11 points, the record low for a Premier League season set by Derby County in 2007-08, would require a significant improvement.</p>
<p>How can this have happened? Wolves finished 16th last season, recovering after a dismal start. When Vitor Pereira took over on 19 December last year, they were second bottom on nine points from 16 games. They picked up 23 points from the final 22 games of the season and effectively ended any prospect of relegation with a run of six successive victories in the spring. How can a team go from averaging near enough a point a game to a 10th of that? The drop-off is extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has said it is immediately pausing all leases for offshore wind farms already under construction, in the heaviest blow yet to an industry that the administration has relentlessly targeted throughout the year.</p>
<p>Trump’s Department of the Interior said that it was halting the building of five wind projects due to “national security risks”. The department said it would work with the US Department of Defense to mitigate the risk of the wind turbine towers creating radar interference called “clutter” that could in some way hamper the US military.</p>

      <p>Video shared by the US Geological Survey on social media shows mud spraying up and out from the Black Diamond Pool in Yellowstone national park. Other recent eruptions have mostly been audible but not visible because they happened either at night or when the camera was obscured by ice. The agency said the Black Diamond Pool was previously the site of a hydrothermal explosion, in July 2024, that sent rocks and mud flying hundreds of feet into the air and damaged a boardwalk. It prompted the closure of the area to visitors due to the damage and potential for additional hazardous activity</p>

<p>Selling unpasteurized milk has been illegal in Canada since 1991, due to its high risk of carrying potentially deadly bacteria. But advocates argue there’s still demand for the product, with some Alberta municipalities lobbying the federal government to make sales legal.</p>

<p>I’ve ridden a lot of electric scooters over the years, and many of them blur together. Plenty are fast. Many are powerful. Some look aggressive. But only a handful manage to combine all of that with a ride that actually feels polished and confidence-inspiring. After spending real time riding the Apollo Phantom 2.0 (52V version), it’s clear this scooter sits firmly in that top tier.</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>Once loose, erratic and reliably unreliable, Jacksonville have hardened into something far more serious, with Trevor Lawrence’s control and confidence turning a hot streak into a genuine AFC threat</p>
<p>Seven weeks ago, the Jaguars were still <em>that</em> team: loose, entertaining, unreliable. The kind that could light up a quarter and then spend the next three undoing it. Now, they’re a wagon.</p>
<p>After beating the Broncos on Sunday, the Jaguars have ripped off six straight wins. They’ve won 11 regular-season games for the first time since 2007. And with two winnable games to close the season, they have a solid path to the No 1 seed, with the AFC potentially running through Jacksonville.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Medetomidine has extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms – and the detox centers that help patients are struggling with how best to cope</p>
<p>The staff at harm reduction hub Sunshine House in the middle of Kensington, a neighborhood in north-east Philadelphia home to the most notorious open drug scene in the US, often reverse at least one overdose per day.</p>
<p>But the mutating illegal drug supply is regularly conjuring new drugs with novel sets of potentially deadly risks. For the past 18 months, there has been a new drug in circulation, the veterinary sedative medetomidine, also known as “rhino tranq”. It has perhaps the most extreme and fast-acting withdrawal symptoms of all known street drugs.</p>

      <h1>The K-shaped cost of holiday travel</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>The holiday travel period is upon us. AAA expects 122 million people will drive or fly somewhere to celebrate. Now, we have some good news and some bad news: For drivers, lower gas prices mean a cheaper holiday season. But other travel-related expenses, like car rentals, hotel stays, and flights, are pricier. Then, Jim Beam is pausing production at a Kentucky facility, and more consumers are utilizing AI to help with holiday shopping.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> One of the most famous names in American whiskey, Jim Beam, says it will halt production at its main facility in Kentucky for all of next year. Like many distillers in the U.S., it's facing pressure from retaliatory tariffs and weaker consumer demand. We'll learn more.

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files">casts fresh light</a> on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.</p>
<p><strong>The DoJ failed to comply with Epstein files law – can Congress do anything?</strong> Lawmakers threatening legal action face major obstacle: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/21/epstein-files-doj-congress">those with legal power in this case are the ones accused of failing to follow the law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Cecot being investigated?</strong> In March, the Trump administration struck a deal with El Salvador to send to Cecot more than 250 Venezuelan migrants that it accused of terrorism and gang membership. Horror stories have since emerged about abuse that they are alleged to have endured, with lawyers for some of the men who were later released describing the conditions as “state-sanctioned torture”.</p>

      <p>Beach sprints are shaking up this most strait-laced of sports and may be heading to a coastal town near you</p>
<p>At a point when most rowers are pounding away on rivers in the wind and rain through the dark winter months, a new breed are honing their skills in brighter climes surrounded by sun, sand and waves, all the while dreaming of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
<p>Out of 17 sports that proposed an extra discipline to the International Olympic Committee, rowing came out on top with its beach sprints format added to the LA 2028 programme. While many may have noticed the addition of five new sports in baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash, a mini-revolution is happening on the water within a sport that will no longer have a lightweight category but will have five coastal rowing events in 2028.</p>

<p>Corruption is a word that’s come up throughout this year in relation to U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. There have been allegations of personal enrichment, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, through his family’s crypto and real estate ventures. There are also accusations of quid pro quo deals with foreign leaders and convicted criminals seeking pardons.
Is this a bug in Trump’s administration, or a feature?
To put it all into focus, Tommy Vietor is here. He’s been following this issue of corruption on his very popular podcast, Pod Save America. He also co-hosts Pod Save the World.

<p>The justice department said the image had been flagged by federal prosecutors in New York for potentially exposing victims of Epstein.

<p>Before Joseph DeAngelo, a 74-year-old navy veteran and former police officer, admitted responsibility for his brutal crimes in court, prosecutor Thien Ho had a request for the judge overseeing the proceedings. He wanted the world to see the killer’s face.</p>
<p>It was 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and social distancing and masking requirements were in full swing. But Ho asked that DeAngelo – the man known as the Golden State Killer, who had covered his face during a more than 10-year reign of terror across California – be required to wear a clear face shield as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/29/golden-state-killer-joseph-deangelo-guilty-plea">pleaded guilty</a>.</p>

<p>The Dahon K-Feather is one of those electric bikes that makes a lot more sense the longer you ride it. On paper, it looks rather low-power and low-capacity compared to the spec sheets for most e-bikes. In practice, especially when used exactly as intended, it turns out to be a remarkably well-executed urban commuter that still feels refreshingly different years after its release.</p>

<p>Caleb Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore in overtime, and the Chicago Bears overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter Saturday night for a 22-16 win over the Green Bay Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love to a concussion.</p>
<p>The Bears (11-4) extended their lead in the NFC North to one and a half games over the Packers (9-5-1) with two left to play and got some payback for a loss at Lambeau Field two weeks earlier. It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.</p>

      <h1>Jeffrey Epstein files latest: New files, including transcripts, released by Department of Justice on Saturday – as it happened</h1>

</ul>
<p>A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.</p>
<p>Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.</p>
<p>Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”</p>
<p>The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.</p>
<p>In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.</p>

<p>Conservative reaction to the partial release of documents in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> case has been mixed, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> supporters highlighting the prominent presence of Bill Clinton and other Democrats in photographs, with others lamenting how the heavy redaction casts Donald Trump and Republicans in a bad light.</p>
<p>Administration officials defended the redactions with fervent hyperbole. “Never in American history has a President or the Department of Justice been this transparent with the American people about such a sensitive law enforcement matter,” said Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who released <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims">a six-page letter describing the redaction process</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-12-20)
      <p>
      <p>The Golden State’s clean energy use hit new highs in 2025. As the Trump administration abandons US climate initiatives, can California fill the void?</p>
<p>As officials from around the world met in Brazil for the Cop30 climate summit last month, the US president was nowhere to be found, nor were any members of his cabinet. Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>.</p>
<p>During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/11/gavin-newsom-trump-cop30">invasive species</a>” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> will stop its practice of shooting pigs and goats to help prepare medics for treating wounded troops in a combat zone, ending an exercise made obsolete by simulators that mimic battlefield injuries.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old American finished third in Saturday’s women’s World Cup downhill at Val d’Isère, France, extending a blistering start to the season that has already included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41">a victory</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/13/lindsey-vonn-second-emma-aicher-world-cup-downhill-st-moritz">a runner-up finish</a> in the space of nine days. But after a small mistake on the lower section of the course cost her valuable time, Vonn left the finish area convinced she had let a potential win slip away.</p>

<p>The initial decoration of a couple of 'eyesore' tree stumps in Creston, B.C. by an anonymous source, leads town staff on a holiday–season decorating mission to spruce up the remaining stumps. While reactions to the initiative are mixed, the festive stumps have certainly become a talking point in the normally quiet southeastern B.C., mountain town.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t be more proud of these guys,” Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said. “Resiliency. It’s been kind of a theme all season long, but it showed up tonight on the road. Down 17, coming back the way we did just one score at a time – just really stayed the course.”</p>

<p>Anthony Joshua wasted little time in Miami turning the page from spectacle to ambition, calling out Tyson Fury moments after stopping Jake Paul in a bout that ended with the YouTuber-turned-boxer driving himself to hospital with a broken jaw.</p>
<p>Joshua halted Paul in the sixth round of Friday night’s heavyweight contest at the Kaseya Center, dropping him four times in a one-sided fight that had been built as a Netflix-backed global event. Afterwards, the former two-time unified champion was blunt in his assessment of his performance and what should come next.</p>

<p>While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>Representatives for victims of convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> condemned the US Department of Justice on Friday for only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/19/jeffrey-epstein-files-us-justice-department">partially releasing</a> investigative documents while at least one survivor said she felt “redeemed” by the documents.</p>
<p>The documents were released under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, which mandated the disclosures by 19 December. The law allows for records to be withheld if they threaten current investigations, disrupt national security or identify Epstein’s victims.</p>

The investigation found that Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022.

<p>Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.</p>
<p>The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.</p>

The company turned down a renewed offer from Paramount of $30 a share, signaling a continued preference for the Netflix deal. Thing is, the transaction will likely draw close regulatory scrutiny from the Trump administration. But first: messy economic data and a deal to buy TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Chicago can edge closer to sealing the NFC North in a sepia-toned Soldier Field showdown that headlines a pivotal week in the NFL playoff race</p>
<p>Another week as the NFL winds up for the postseason offers a fresh look at contenders building for the Super Bowl. Jacksonville v Denver, yes please. Baltimore v New England, bingo. Pittsburgh v Detroit, hmm … OK. Still not satisfied? The strange lights of Saturday night over in the NFC North should do the trick with a sepia-toned showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field. A win for either and a Detroit defeat confirms a playoff slot while victory for the Bears gets them close to sealing the division (even in defeat the Packers still will be ahead for the seventh seed). The gaping hole left by Micah Parsons in Green Bay’s defensive front may have Chicago fans edging to the side of expectation that their Bears can put together a deep playoff run if home-field advantage is on their side.</p>

      <p>EPA proposed undoing Biden-era policy on exposure to carcinogenic toxin in latest push to weaken toxin standards</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s Environmental Protection Agency ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa">EPA</a>) is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/chemicals-under-tsca/epa-releases-updated-draft-risk-calculation-memorandum-formaldehyde-under-tsca">proposing</a> to increase the levels of exposure to highly carcinogenic formaldehyde it considers safe. If successful, people would continue to be exposed to concerning amounts of the toxin in thousands of everyday products used across the economy, experts and advocates say.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde, a pungent colorless gas at room temperature, is found in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, home cleaners, craft supplies, leather goods, furniture, clothing, plastic, building materials and other everyday goods. During <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s term, EPA scientists took a major step toward reining in the broad societal risk by issuing a finding that any level of exposure to formaldehyde can cause cancer, and very low levels cause non-cancer health harms.</p>

      <h1>Data centers and your electric bill</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>Electricity prices are up 6.9% year over year — much higher than overall inflation — and costs are expected to go up even more in the future. So, how are energy-hungry data centers, used to power AI, crypto, and more, impacting electric bills? That's a question that several Senate Democrats had, who opened an investigation into tech firms this week. Also on the show: TikTok ownership and real estate agents' thoughts on the market.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A man suspected of killing two people and wounding nine others at Brown University before going on to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/suspect-brown-university-shooting">has been found dead</a> in a New Hampshire storage facility, where he had rented a unit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How has the White House responded to the</strong> <strong>incident?</strong> The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has ordered the suspension of the green card lottery program at Donald Trump’s direction, saying it had enabled the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to enter the US.</p>
<p><strong>What did Volodymyr Zelenskyy say about the deal?</strong> The Ukrainian president wrote on social media that the deal “is significant support that truly strengthens our resilience”, adding: “It is important that Russian assets remain immobilised and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.”</p>

      <p>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience</p>
<p>When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.</p>
<p>In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The former Liverpool winger speaks about his hot start at Bayern, playing with Harry Kane, and hopes for the 2026 World Cup</p>
<p>After leaving Liverpool this past summer, Luis Díaz has had a strong start at Bayern Munich under Vincent Kompany, having accumulated 18 goal contributions (12 goals, six assists) in all competitions. Bayern manager Vincent Kompany gave Díaz a few days off to press the reset button after his sending off against PSG, but now the 28-year-old winger is back and ready to wrap up the year as Bayern play their final game of 2025 this Sunday when they travel to Heidenheim. I spoke to the Colombian star about his new club, life in Germany and next summer’s World Cup, which includes a headline matchup against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.</p>

      <p>Building artificial intelligence tools requires a lot of graphic processing units, and those GPUs need huge amounts of ultra-fast memory to feed them data. Micron Technology is one of a handful of memory chip makers that has been selling a whole lot of memory, thanks to the AI boom.</p>
<p>Plus, cloud company Oracle's data center debt is coming under scrutiny. And Merriam-Webster names the word of the year for 2025: slop.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, to learn more on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</p>

<p>“It was something we talked about throughout the season and particularly for this game because of the playoff situation,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said. “You know, you play for the tie and lock up a playoff seat, but I just felt great about our play and I trusted our guys.”</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers will release more photographs from evidence gathered from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein if the Department of Justice fails to meet the Friday deadline to disclose investigative documents, Congressman Robert Garcia told CNN yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2001475597109772655">Erin Burnett</a>, Garcia said a petition to the federal court by Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s convicted accomplice - to have her conviction on sex trafficking charges thrown out and to obtain a pardon do not trigger an exemption to the law Congress passed mandating a release of documents by the DoJ.</p>

      <p>
      <p>November inflation data came in lower than expected, according to the latest CPI report. But we can’t compare it to the previous month, since the BLS skipped several October reports. And data collection began late thanks to the shutdown, right in the middle of retailers’ Black Friday sales. In this episode, key caveats to the November CPI. Plus: Experts cautiously predict a more balanced housing market in 2026, tech stocks take a hit as data center debt climbs, and a growing number of politicians reject economists’ expertise.</p>

<p>Authorities said Thursday that they’re looking into a connection between last weekend’s mass shooting at Brown University and one two days later near Boston that killed a professor at another elite school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>That is according to three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss an investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the people said investigators had identified a person of interest in the shootings and were actively seeking that individual.</p>

      <p>With the Christmas recess slowing the political havoc, it’s time to hand out the Guardian’s parliamentarian of the year awards</p>
<p>You can hear the sighs of relief. Not from the MPs who are packing up to slope back to their constituencies for the Christmas recess, but from the rest of the country. Finally, the year is coming to an end and there will be few chances for our politicians to do any further damage before they return to Westminster in January.</p>
<p>The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up.</p>

      <h1>Deadline nears for release of Epstein files – what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department must release most documents by Friday, and failure to do so would provoke a firestorm</p>
<p>In less than 48 hours, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release most of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">files</a> related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in its possession. Last month, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405/text">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, which required the release of those materials by 19 December, except in narrow cases where they would jeopardize current investigations, harm national security or foreign policy goals, or reveal information about Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>Since Trump signed the legislation, his administration has been silent on its progress. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers asked Pam Bondi, the attorney general, for a briefing on the department of justice’s progress, but she did not provide one. Two Democratic senators among that group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/democrats-epstein-files-pam-bondi">subsequently pledged</a> to block some civilian nominees, because they were concerned the administration “is gearing up to disregard the law we led the fight in the Senate to pass, which overwhelmingly passed both chambers of Congress”.</p>

<p>The New York Times columnist David Brooks appeared in multiple photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein that were released on Thursday by the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p>
<p>The photos, which have been rolled out in batches by the minority Democrats in the committee, lack crucial context, including dates and locations. But the photos appear to show Brooks attending a lunch or dinner event. Brooks is shown seated next to Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> unveiled new actions aimed at eliminating transition-related medical care for minors across the US on Thursday, referring to such treatments as “sex-rejecting procedures”, a term used by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
<p>As part of the effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a rule-making process that would prevent hospitals from offering puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgical procedures to minors if they wish to participate in Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>Over what the magazine said was 11 separate interviews by reporter Chris Whipple, Susie Wiles spoke candidly about her colleagues, describing Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, JD Vance, the vice-president, as being a “conspiracy theorist for a decade” and Russell Vought, the budget chief, as a “right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>First female appointment to a major oil company has faced fierce resistance from climate activists as boss of Woodside</p>
<p>The surprise appointment of BP’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive">third chief executive in a tumultuous five years</a> reflects the embattled fossil fuel producer’s need for profound change. The hiring of Meg O’Neill appears to offer exactly that.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, is the first female head of a major oil company, and the first “outsider” to be hired to a position usually reserved for company veterans. She joins from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside, where she took up her first chief executive role only four years ago.</p>

      <p>In his 19-minute address to the nation last night, President Donald Trump argued that he inherited a mess from former President Biden; the president claimed he'd made historic improvements to the lives of Americans over the past 11 months.

(date: 2025-12-18)

      <p>DoJ says a group of protesters at an ICE detention center was part of a terror cell; legal experts say it is an effort to crack down on leftwing groups and deter protesters</p>
<p>After the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September, Donald Trump and others pledged a no-holds barred crackdown on leftwing activists.</p>
<p>“We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” Trump said after Kirk’s shooting. Top White House officials, including JD Vance and Stephen Miller, repeatedly publicly vowed that a crackdown was coming. In particular, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">government focused</a> on “Antifa.” short for antifascist, is not an organization but rather an ideology that broadly describes a variety of left-leaning beliefs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men’s World Cup, compared with current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most fans</p>
<p>In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.</p>
<p>An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry">1.6% of sellable tickets</a> for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.</p>

The agreement covers all aspects of trade, but the most controversial area is agriculture. Farmers have been protesting because they fear a glut of cheap imports. Then, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever roadmap for tackling a Europe-wide housing affordability crisis earlier this week. We'll discuss it with the EU's housing Commissioner.</p>

<p>Canadians under 35 missed credit payments at higher rates in the third quarter than they did at the same time last year, and they're seeking debt relief services in higher numbers, as living costs are outpacing wages. The popularity of &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plans could be making the problem worse. CBC's Jenna Benchetrit explains</p>

<p>Venezuela's bitumen-heavy oil is virtually identical to Canada's and the South American country has the largest proven reserves in the world. But Venezuelan oil has essentially disappeared from world markets over the past 20 years. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to invade Venezuela have opened up the prospect that it could one day return, with huge implications for Canada.</p>

      <p>The defensive end’s pursuit of the NFL sack record defies belief, raising questions about what his perpetually rebuilding team should do about it</p>
<p>The NFL sack record is one of those hallowed figures in professional sports. Michael Strahan’s 22.5 lingered for two decades not because pass rushers failed to get better, but because everything has to break just right for someone to reach it. You need volume. You need game scripts. You need offenses chasing points. When TJ Watt finally tied it in 2021, it felt like he had reached the outer limit. The record had been touched, but not broken.</p>
<p>Myles Garrett has spent this season treating that assumption with contempt. Now, he’s a couple of plays away from history.</p>

      <p>Search engines, social media, e-commerce, and mobile games all make money by selling advertising. But making ads work in AI search might not be so straight forward. Perplexity, for instance, reportedly pulled back on plans to integrate ads into their AI search engine. And internal documents showed the company made only $20,000 in ad revenue in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Garrett Johnson, professor of marketing at Boston University to get a sense of why jumping into the ad business is difficult.</p>

      <h1>US government admits negligence in helicopter-plane collision that killed 67</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Official response to lawsuit filed by victims’ relatives admits FAA and army failures played role in Washington DC crash</p>
<p>The US government admitted on Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration and the army played a role in causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/aircraft-crash-ronald-reagan-airport-virginia">the collision in January</a> between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter near the nation’s capital, killing 67 people in the deadliest crash on American soil in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The official response to the first lawsuit filed by one of the victims’ families said that the government is liable in the crash partly because the air traffic controller violated procedures about when to rely on pilots to maintain visual separation that night. Plus, the filing said, the army helicopter pilots’ “failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid” the airline jet makes the government liable.</p>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The Senate has given final passage to an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs. The legislation is attempting to overhaul how the Pentagon purchases weapons and pressures Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela. The annual National Defense Authorization Act also raises troop pay by 3.8%. However, the legislation includes some pushback on recent moves by the Pentagon. Several Republican senators back Hegseth and his decision not to release the video publicly. Democrats call for part of the video to be released publicly and for every member of Congress to have access to the full footage.</p>

<p>White House officials on Wednesday revised what they call the “Presidential Walk of Fame,” installing plaques beneath portraits of former presidents that reflect Donald Trump’s own views, including branding former president Joe Biden as “the worst president in American history”.</p>
<p>The changes are part of Trump’s broader effort to reshape the White House environment to match his preferences. Along the colonnade, portraits of past presidents now feature expanded text that permanently records Trump’s assessments of their records.</p>

      <p>Senate advances 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which White House says Trump will sign into law</p>
<p>The US Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to advance a $901bn bill setting policy for the Pentagon, sending the big piece of legislation to the White House, which has said Donald Trump will sign it into law.</p>
<p>The fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, is a compromise between separate measures passed earlier this year in the House of Representatives and Senate. It authorizes a record $901bn in annual military spending, with a 4% pay raise for the troops, purchases of military equipment and efforts to boost competitiveness with US archrivals China and Russia.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami re-signs Luis Suárez for 2026 season after winning MLS Cup</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona striker, who turns 39 in January, has been productive but was benched for the tail end of Miami’s title run</p>
<p>Inter Miami have re-signed striker Luis Suárez through the 2026 season, the MLS Cup champions announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The legendary Uruguay international had 17 goals and 17 assists in 50 appearances for the team in 2025. However, Inter Miami became a buzzsaw after Suárez was dropped to the bench by head coach Javier Mascherano. Replaced by Mateo Silvetti after Miami’s 2-1 loss at Nashville SC in Round One, Miami won their next four games and outscored opponents 16-2 in route to the MLS Cup title.</p>

</ul>
<p>So it appears Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, agrees with many of us: she thinks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/susie-wiles-trump-interview">Donald Trump’s cabinet is bonkers</a>.</p>
<p>From that bombshell Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1">interview</a>, which featured some <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/693b2a465fd632c8d81d318f/master/w_1600,c_limit/202602-portfolio-embed02%20(1).jpg">truly terrifying</a> close-up photos, we learned that Wiles considers JD Vance to have been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade”. She believes Elon Musk to be an “odd, odd duck”. Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, is, in Wiles’ view, “a right-wing absolute zealot”.</p>
<p>“If we’re judging by these numbers, Americans are completely dissatisfied with the way things are happening in this country.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-17)
      <p>
      <p>Community members have stepped up with carpools, food deliveries, school patrols and policy advocacy</p>
<p>Before the school bell rang on the morning of 19 November, dozens of parents – mostly dads – huddled outside schools all around Durham, North Carolina. Bleary-eyed from late-night meetings and dinging group chats, they passed out whistles and gloves before dispersing to stand along school perimeters.</p>
<p>The parents had formed ad hoc welcoming committees for students being dropped off for school – and to serve as a united group of watchdogs against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). A week before Thanksgiving, federal immigration agents had descended upon the city as part of a massive statewide campaign that included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/activists-immigration-charlotte-north-carolina">Charlotte</a> and smaller communities. For almost a month, masked agents, often in tactical vests or fatigues and some <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/12/05/ice-agents-once-again-operating-in-north-carolina-activists-say-including-arrests-in-durham/">carrying rifles</a>, patrolled quiet neighborhoods and vibrant shopping centers around North Carolina. ICE <a href="https://www.wunc.org/race-class-communities/2025-12-12/ice-arrests-nc-criminal-record-triangle-customs-border-patrol">doubled its North Carolina arrests</a> in 2025 from the previous year, totaling 3,400 arrests from 20 January through 15 October.</p>

      <h1>How are your wages comparing to inflation?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-17)

But first, holiday season retail sales numbers out yesterday from the Census Bureau were unexpectedly flat.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/trump-orders-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela">ordered “a total and complete” blockade</a> of all oil tankers under sanctions from entering and leaving Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.</p>
<p><strong>What has Trump said?</strong> In a post on social media last night announcing the blockade, Trump alleged Venezuela was using oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes and vowed to escalate the military buildup. “Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the shooting?</strong> A person dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people</a> and wounded nine others at Brown during final exams.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others</p>
<p>A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.</p>
<p>Former prosecutors and legal experts call the Miami-based inquiry, which has issued some two dozen subpoenas so far, a “fishing expedition”. The investigation’s apparent focus is to identify ways to criminally charge ex-FBI and intelligence officials who have already been investigated and effectively exonerated by two special counsels and a Republican-led Senate panel, which mounted exhaustive inquiries into Russia’s efforts to boost Trump in 2016.</p>

      <p>A career in tech was once seen as a safe bet — the jobs were plentiful, the pay was ample. But this year the tech sector had another “meh” year for hiring according to the job site Indeed. Tech jobs have been declining now for several years, but this year, the losses at least seemed to stabilize, according to Indeed's latest Jobs &amp; Hiring Trends Report. Still, job postings in the industry remain well below their pre-pandemic baseline.</p>

<p>Canada's tax agency says it doesn't expect Canadians who hold simple trusts, known as bare trusts, to file required tax forms this coming tax season — but legislative changes currently before the House of Commons means the requirements will likely be there in 2027.</p>

<p>Undocumented youth in Canada say they’re feeling worried and hopeless as they face decades-long processing times for permanent residence under the humanitarian and compassionate pathway. Lawyers fear more children will lose their status in the coming years, forcing them to go underground.</p>

<p>The Australian classification review board has overturned a decision to block Australians seeing footage of the shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media after Elon Musk’s X appealed against the ruling sought by the eSafety commissioner.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/charlie-kirk-murder-suspect-court-appearance">Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University</a> on 10 September, the eSafety commissioner applied to the board to have video of the shooting classified in Australia. The video was ruled to be “refused classification”, which allowed eSafety to serve notices on social media platforms ordering them to geo-block the posts from view for Australia-based users.</p>

<p>Wiles also said she had told <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that his second term was not supposed to be a retribution tour.</p>
<p>“ <strong>We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over</strong>,” she said in an <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-2">interview</a> in March.</p>
<p>I mean, people could think <strong>it</strong> <em><strong>does</strong></em> <strong>look vindictive</strong>. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t think he [Trump] wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it</strong>.</p>
<p>Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.</p>

      <p>The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to 4.6% in November, according to the latest BLS jobs report.

<p>Downing Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79x54dprngo">BBC reported</a> on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.</p>
<p>The agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/business/economy/trump-uk-trade-deal-tariffs.html">New York Times first reported</a> British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Van Hollen go after tech firms including Google and Amazon</p>
<p>Three Democratic US senators announced Tuesday that they are investigating whether big tech companies are passing the soaring utility costs of “energy-guzzling” data centers on to ordinary Americans. The trio sent letters to the heads of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta as well as the data center operators CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix asking for greater transparency, cost-sharing and accountability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut wrote that they were alarmed by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">reports</a> that these data centers caused residential electricity bills to “skyrocket”. Regions with significant data center activity have already endured price increases <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/">by as much as 267%</a> over the past five years, the three lawmakers wrote. According to the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency, the average cost of a US family’s electricity bill had risen 7% year-over-year as of September.</p>

<p>Speaking to Vanity Fair, Wiles described Trump – who is teetotal – as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, an insight she ascribed to her relationship with her late father, the broadcaster and NFL star Pat Summerall, who had alcoholism.</p>

      <p>Randy Fine and Tommy Tuberville, US legislators, face backlash for Islamophobic calls to deport Muslims</p>
<p>Democrats are condemning two Republican members of Congress who said, in the wake of the mass shooting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news">Australia</a>, that the US should ban Muslims from the country and kick out those who already live here.</p>
<p>Congressman Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, said he not only wants deportations of legal immigrants who are Muslim, but “citizenship revocations wherever possible” of Muslims.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>The cost of health insurance is becoming increasingly unaffordable. With many Affordable Care Act marketplace subsidies set to expire, coverage is about to get even more pricier for more than 20 million people next year. These growing costs are fueling interest in a market for cash-only doctors. Today, we'll hear more. But first, all of those government layoffs and employee buyouts have hit the labor market. We’ll discuss.</p>

Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit">suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech</a> he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>On what basis is Trump suing?</strong> He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.</p>
<p><strong>What roadblocks remain to a deal?</strong> The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?</strong> He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.</p>

      <p>The Zen-like US representative from Minnesota has had the highest level of death threats of any congressperson because of the president’s attacks</p>
<p>“That’s Teddy,” said Tim Mynett, husband of the US representative Ilhan Omar, as their five-year-old labrador retriever capered around her office on Capitol Hill. “If you make too much eye contact, he’ll lose it. He’s my best friend – and he’s our security detail these days.”</p>
<p>The couple were sitting on black leather furniture around a coffee table. Apart from a sneezing fit that took her husband by surprise, Omar had an unusual Zen-like calm for someone who receives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMJuCtlxe0M">frequent death threats</a> and is the subject of a vendetta from the most powerful man in the world.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Since Trump’s second term began in January, global healthcare, especially for sexual and reproductive health, has been under constant attack</p>
<p>This time last year, women’s rights organisations were bracing themselves for a second Trump term. Few were prepared for the chaos that would be unleashed in January. The volume and speed of executive orders coming out of the White House were seen as a deliberate tactic to overwhelm and create panic. In many ways it worked – there was confusion, anger and exhaustion as organisations scrambled to fill the gap left by the USAID freeze. But that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>The US administration has been the key driver, supported by intense advocacy work by ultra-conservative groups using the moment to strengthen global ties with political allies.</p>

      <h1>How states are competing in the data center gold rush</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Tech giants are estimated to have spent almost <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/tech-ai-spending-company-valuations-7b92104b">$400 billion</a> in capital expenditures this year, mostly to build data centers for artificial intelligence. A single massive facility can have a price tag in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And many states want in on that spending spree. Thirty-seven states have some sort of incentive program to attract data centers with the hope of bringing a boost to their local economies. They're giving away hundreds of millions in tax exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Nicholas Miller, policy associate at NCSL, to learn more.</p>

      <p>Inflation, rising food prices and the high cost of living have been top of mind for consumers all year. But then Olive Garden offers an unlimited pasta meal, or a chain steakhouse restaurant sells a steak dinner with two sides for less than 30 bucks.

      <h1>Joshua v Paul makes Joe Louis’ ‘Bum of the Month’ look like the Rumble in the Jungle | Sean Ingle</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>The best we can hope for is that Paul does not get seriously hurt. Joshua, Netflix and the sport itself should know better</p>
<p>Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.</p>
<p>“McCoy was expected to crumple under the first punch Louis tossed in his direction,” the New York Times’ correspondent wrote. “Instead, the wily New England veteran made Louis appear ludicrous at times. Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out. Louis had won, but only his bank balance had been enhanced.</p>

<p>Today, an in-depth look at puberty blockers and their use on minors with gender dysphoria. These drugs have come under an enormous amount of scrutiny in recent years, with some questioning their benefits, safety and long-term impact.
After banning the use of puberty blockers for gender treatment of people under 18, a new clinical trial in the U.K. aims to get to the bottom of those concerns.
Azeen Ghorayshi is a science and gender reporter for the New York Times.
She’ll parse through what we know and don’t know about the effects of blockers in minors, how this became a hugely divisive and politicized debate around the world, and whether this new trial could change our understanding.

<p>More tributes to <strong>Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov</strong> came from the American Uzbekistan Association, who said he “was known for his sharp intellect, kind heart, and quiet willingness to help anyone in need”.</p>
<p>The association wrote on Instagram, praising his “humility and compassion” as well as his “curiosity, discipline, and generosity”.</p>
<p>More than a gifted student, Aziz was a beloved son, brother, and friend. He had a future filled with promise, and his life was cut short far too soon. His passing has left an immeasurable void in the hearts of his family, friends, classmates, and the broader Uzbek American community.</p>
<p>On behalf of the American Uzbekistan Association, we extend our deepest and most heartfelt condolences to Mukhammad Aziz’s family during this time of unimaginable grief. We stand with them in mourning and are grateful to all who have offered prayers, messages of support, and solidarity.</p>
<p>Mukhammad Aziz will be remembered for his kindness, his potential, and the light he brought into the lives of others. His memory will endure.</p>

      <p>Video released during a press conference showed an individual dressed in dark clothing before the mass shooting at Brown University. The individual walked alone and they do not appear to be carrying anything in their hands. The individual’s face is concealed and appears to have a light complexion. 'We’re asking for the public’s assistance in … identifying this individual,' said Providence police chief Oscar Perez, urging the public to contact the tipline set up by law enforcement regarding the person responsible for the shooting.</p>

      <p>Company to scrap several electric models and focus on gas and hybrid as US president pulls support for EVs</p>
<p>Ford said on Monday it will take a $19.5bn writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand.</p>
<p>Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an Erev, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.</p>

<p>Attorneys with the US Department of Justice have reportedly said they felt pressured to accuse the University of California of discriminating against Jewish students and faculty, at the urging of the Trump administration, in what one lawyer described as a “hit job”.</p>
<p>Nine attorneys, some of whom requested anonymity, shared insider accounts with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-13/former-doj-attorneys-university-of-california-ucla-antisemitism-investigation">Los Angeles Times</a> of the federal government’s investigation into California’s research university system. The attorneys said they felt pushed to conclude the UC had violated the law before they had determined the facts. All of the attorneys eventually resigned.</p>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>President’s statement blaming acclaimed director’s death on his dislike of him described as ‘disgusting’ and ‘vile’</p>
<p>Celebrities and lawmakers from both of the US’s major political parties are condemning Donald Trump after the president blamed the death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/dec/15/rob-reiner-obituary">Rob Reiner</a> on what he described as the acclaimed Hollywood director’s dislike of him.</p>
<p>After the apparent killings of Reiner, 78, and his 68-year-old wife, Michele, who were found dead at their home Sunday in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, Trump took to social media to call the director “tortured and struggling”. Trump also claimed Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind-crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME”.</p>

November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.</p>

<p>The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Law enforcement and public health experts worry that potential cuts to resources that save lives and stop the flow of drugs into the state could raise overdose deaths</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s proposed cuts in federal funding for law enforcement and public health agencies could have a devastating impact on Alaska, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis">which a Guardian analysis found</a> has struggled to curtail overdose deaths even amid a general decline in national overdose fatalities.</p>

      <p>There’s more evidence that China’s economy is stalling. Beijing released a batch of government data today that was not encouraging. Chinese consumers have slammed their wallets shut, and data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China paints a picture of stagnating investment, output, and consumption. And later, we'll preview long-delayed economic data slated to come out this week and learn why retailers are hiring fewer workers for the holiday shopping season.</p>

      <p>Spurs have faced low moments in their history, and this is one of them. How will the club respond in the post-Daniel Levy era?</p>

</ul>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/14/nottingham-forest-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest</a>, are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).</p>
<p>Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">leaves them 11th</a>, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.</p>

      <h1>Brown University shooting: what we know so far about the attack in Providence, Rhode Island</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released</p>
<p>Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p><strong>A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day</strong>. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. <strong>The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A shooter dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University</a> during final exams</strong> on the Ivy League campus.</p>
<p><strong>Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students</strong>. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital</strong>, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.</p>
<p><strong>Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,</strong> praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.</p>
<p><strong>The two slain have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims">identified</a> by loved ones as</strong> <strong>Ella Cook</strong> <strong>, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and</strong> <strong>MukhammadAziz Umurzokov</strong> <strong>, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.</strong> Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.</p>
<p><strong>The university <a href="https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy">announced</a> that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.</strong> A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.</strong> An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.</p>
<p><strong>The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.</strong> Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”</p>
<p><strong>The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department</strong>. According to the university’s website, the building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices. Brown, one of the America’s most prestigious colleges, has roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students.</p>

      <p>This week, the Senate is set to take up the $900 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed it last week. It is more than 3,000 pages of defense policy planning that the Senate will be digging through; the actual funding of these plans comes later. But there's also a whole lot of stuff that's not defense-related. Today, we'll dig in. Plus, we'll hear how China came to dominate in money laundering.</p>

<p>LeBron James made two free throws with 3.9 seconds left, Luka Dončić scored 29 points and the Los Angeles Lakers recovered from blowing a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter to top the Phoenix Suns 116-114 on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Phoenix trailed 99-79 with 7:48 left, but took a 114-113 lead with 12.2 seconds left on Dillon Brooks’s three-pointer over James, who made contact with Brooks after the shot. Brooks bumped James on the way back down the court, earning his second technical foul and an ejection.</p>
<p>More importantly, it gave the Lakers a free throw, but James missed the shot. On the ensuing possession, James was fouled on a three-point attempt by Devin Booker with 3.9 seconds left. The 40-year-old James – who finished with 26 points – missed the first free throw but made the final two to give the Lakers a 115-114 lead. Phoenix’s Grayson Allen got up an awkward shot at the buzzer, but it was blocked by James.</p>

Then, a Hong Kong court has found media tycoon Jimmy Lai guilty of sedition. And later, retailers in the U.S. are hiring a record low number of seasonal employees.</p>

      <h1>Brown University shooting: authorities say they released sole person of interest</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>At least two people were killed and nine others injured in Saturday attack that occurred in engineering building on Providence, Rhode Island campus</p>

</ul>
<p>A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.</p>
<p>The disclosure was made at a hastily convened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&amp;t=908">late night news conference</a> to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”</p>
<p>The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.</p>

      <h1>US librarians tackle ‘manufactured crisis’ of book bans to protect LGBTQ+ rights</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>In at least half a dozen states, librarians have joined forces with civil rights groups to oppose book bans, often facing personal and professional repercussions</p>
<p>For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.</p>
<p>“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”</p>

<p>Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home.

When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Federal funds helped Bogalusa address the deep roots of crime – but with the grant pulled, has momentum been lost for ever?</p>
<p>Before the street outside her mother’s home filled with gunfire, before panicked partygoers sprinted through the front yard, before she discovered that the body on the ground was a young man she had watched grow up, Khlilia Daniels knew something in Bogalusa had to change.</p>
<p>It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place. Murders, once rare, now seemed to be happening almost every month, shootings every other week, and in a city of just over 10,000 people, that violence felt close, the losses personal. The victims and perpetrators were predominantly Black, usually young and too often cousins, neighbors or the children of friends, people whom Daniels would see around, until suddenly they were gone.</p>

<p><strong>Were either known to the authorities?</strong> Naveed Akram was examined by security agencies in October 2019 because of his alleged associations with others, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0">He said</a> the alleged shooters were not thought to be “part of a wider [terrorist] cell”.</p>
<p><strong>Are gun laws being discussed?</strong> Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.</p>

<p>The word &quot;slop&quot; was first used to refer to soft mud in the 1700s, but has since evolved to mean of little value — especially when referring to online content of low quality that's made with artificial intelligence. Runners-up include &quot;touch grass,&quot; &quot;performative&quot; and &quot;6-7.&quot;</p>

      <h1>Philip Rivers: how a 44-year-old grandpa nearly pulled off one of the NFL’s greatest comebacks</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <p>The Colts quarterback was coaching high school football before his surprise return. And he showed brains are almost important as brawn at his position</p>
<p>Is quarterback <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers-playbooks-nfl-quarterback">the most demanding position in sports</a>? It’s close enough to make no difference: players must memorize a complicated playbook, orchestrate an entire offense, scan for open receivers while 280lb opponents sprint toward them with violent intent, and then thread a pass to a target who could be 30 yards downfield amid a crowd of defenders. Now try doing all that as a 44-year-old grandfather, exactly 1,800 days since you last started an NFL game.</p>
<p>Philip Rivers broke a historic streak for the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. The longest layoff between games before then belonged to another 44-year-old quarterback who returned to action after years out of the game, and some time in coaching – Steve DeBerg for the Atlanta Falcons in 1998.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown University students were told that all remaining classes and exams for the semester would be delayed after the shooting that killed two people and left several others injured.</p>
<p>In a note to students, the university’s provost, <strong>Francis J Doyle III</strong>, said the decision was made “out of our profound concern for all students, faculty and staff on our campus”. He encouraged students and staff to focus on their safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus. Students are free to leave if they are able. Students who remain will have access to on-campus services and support.</p>
<p>At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now. University leaders are committed to providing care and mobilizing resources to assist our community members through this difficult time.</p>

<p>“We almost had a midair collision up here,” the JetBlue pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic control. “They passed directly in our flight path ... They don’t have their transponder turned on, it’s outrageous.”</p>

      <p>End of subsidies after failed legislation will have serious and damaging impact on entire sector, policy experts say</p>
<p>With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.</p>
<p>The average amount ACA plan enrollees pay annually for premiums is estimated to more than double, from an average of <span class="math inline">\(888 this year to \)</span>1,904 in 2026, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">KFF analysis</a>.</p>

      <p>In an economy that rewards confession and self-labeling, pain is no longer something to survive – but something to brand, sell, and curate</p>
<p>In March 2023, Dr Gabor Maté, a retired family physician and among the most respected trauma experts in the world, boldly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/12/the-trauma-doctor-gabor-mate-on-happiness-hope-and-how-to-heal-our-deepest-wounds">diagnosed</a> Prince Harry with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), during a live interview.</p>

These were not evidence of disease per se, Maté went on to elaborate. Rather, he said: “I see it as a normal response to abnormal stress.”</p>

<p>Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.</p>
<p>The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.</p>

<p>Hundreds of police spent the night scouring the campus in Rhode Island and nearby neighbourhoods as the suspect remained at large</p>

      <p>As LA’s mayor touted a developer’s model home, residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades wrangle for insurance payouts</p>
<p>Nearly a year after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires">mammoth wildfire</a> tore through Pacific Palisades, leveling 7,000 structures and leaving many displaced, some residents watched as the mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> hailed a “major milestone” in the effort to recover.</p>
<p>A new home had been built, the first since the firestorms that killed at least 12 people in the Pacific Palisades and 19 people in Altadena, and the Los Angeles department of building and safety had issued a certificate saying it had passed inspection and was ready for people to move in.</p>

<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country's bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.</p>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure</p>
<p>For states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">AI</a>) technology in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.</p>
<p>The Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview">who meet certain application criteria</a>, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.</p>

<p>The man behind the Moose Jaw health centre that has claimed “a 100 per cent success rate in stopping the progression and in restoring function of people with ALS” says a recent CBC story about his company is evidence that he is seen as “a direct threat to the ALS drug industry.”</p>

<p>Canadians under 35 are seeking debt relief services in higher numbers and missing credit payments at higher rates. Student loans, first credit cards and slow wage growth aren't helping, but experts say the ubiquity of &quot;buy now, pay later&quot; plans are making the problem worse.</p>

<p>Bethany Oeming has often fielded questions from people wondering what the secret was to her muscular body. At 36, when she was pregnant with her second child, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation called familial partial lipodystrophy. Suddenly, what she thought was simply her “body type” was reframed as a lifelong medical condition.</p>

<p>In the annals of Royal Family history, 2025 will be remembered as the year the monarch took the virtually unprecedented step of stripping his younger brother of his titles and honours. But as much as the scandal surrounding the former prince now known only as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor garnered headlines, there were other notable moments this year that sent signals about the monarchy and its future.</p>

<p>Only two provinces allow for the recall of politicians. But with the bar set high for the process, most politicians targeted are likely not in any jeopardy. Here's a closer look at recall legislation in Canada, its history, arguments for and against, and the chances of a recall succeeding.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with the pains associated with buying tickets for high-profile events: Face value tickets are expensive — if they’re even available, and tickets often sell out fast, only to pop up on resale sites, where they’re sold for exorbitant prices. But there are ways to push back, experts say, especially as people voice increasing dissatisfaction.</p>
