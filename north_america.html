<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
The United States and Ukraine are weighing a deal that would give the
U.S. a cut of revenues from Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. But Gracelin
Baskaran, mining economist at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said rare earths aren’t all that rare. So why is the Trump
administration scrambling to get its hands on these minerals from other
countries? On the show today, Baskaran explains what rare earths are,
why mining them isn’t always economically attractive, and what the U.S.
is doing to try to catch up with China’s rare earth production. Plus,
why recycling is only part of the solution.

Then, we’ll get into why Canadians are boycotting American vacations.
And, how easy is it to get someone to dream about a tree or supply chain
economics?

<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Market Place</p>
<p>Officials in Maryland, New York, New Mexico and Kansas City are among
those launching recruitment campaigns targeting federal workers. But
matching those workers’ federal salaries and competing with private
sector offers will be tough.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Most of us can only wonder what goes on in U.S. national security
leaders’ group chats, but The Atlantic’s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey
Goldberg doesn’t have to. Last week, Goldberg was accidentally included
in a Signal group chat with high-ranking members of the Donald Trump
administration, in which they discussed imminent war operations. Yes,
this actually happened. Plus, the whopping $2.1 billion verdict you
might’ve missed over Roundup weed killer. And, we smile over what’s
happened since congestion pricing went into effect in Manhattan — all
while dropping some Latin vocab.
