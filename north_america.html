      <h1>The cost of GOP cuts to coal royalties</h1>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>Wyoming made billions from coal mining over the last 50 years, funding the government, schools, roads, parks. But President Trump’s major spending bill, passed in July, gives mining companies a break on royalty fees — leaving state budgets lean. In this episode, easing coal fees comes at a price. Plus: Non-store retail spending saw double-digit year-over-year growth, small businesses suffer as they wait for tariff clarity, and stock investors basically ignore all the bad economic headlines.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Public companies report their earnings every three months, giving investors and the public regular snapshots of how business is going. But President Trump wants to see fewer of those reports. In a social media post on Monday, he said companies should report just twice a year instead of quarterly.

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>On Monday, President Trump said public companies should no longer report quarterly earnings. Instead, he suggested corporations report just twice a year. Trump isn't the first to suggest a pared-down reporting schedule, but the idea raises questions about the balance between corporate transparency and long-term growth. Also on the show, the South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human rights violations during a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where 300 South Korean workers were detained and deported. So what does this episode tell us about the U.S. immigration system? Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation of American Policy, joins us to discuss.</p>

      <p>"When you face bad economic numbers, you've got two choices: fix the economy or attack the numbers," says University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration. But first, grocery prices jumped in August. Thing is, tariffs aren't to blame.</p>

      <h1>The BLS has a $700 million budget. What's its ROI?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09)
      <p>
      <p>Budget cuts may be in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' future. But the data collected by the BLS is critical for federal decision making. In this episode, we calculate if the $700 million investment is worthwhile. Plus: Firms that spend the most on AI slash tons of jobs, economic uncertainty drives up the price of gold, and mortgage rates fall — which is good for buyers but a bad sign for the overall economy.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

Plus, we'll get fresh reads on consumer and producer prices this week. How much might these affect a rate cut by the Fed?</p>

      <p>China's exports to the U.S. are down a third year over year. That’s a significant drop, reflective of President Trump’s punishing tariff agenda. Although China’s overall export growth has slowed, it still rose 4.5% in August — thanks, in part, to strategic redirection to new markets. In this episode, what the U.S. stands to lose by cutting off China as a trade partner.

      <p>The Trump family took their digital token public this week.

Instead, a federal judge said all the company has to do is share some of its search data with rivals.</p><br/><p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Natasha Mascarenhas, a reporter at The Information, to discuss all of this and more.</p>

      <h1>Is grieving with AI a healthy way to cope?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-02)
      <p>
      <p>More and more people are using generative AI to “resurrect” deceased loved ones. There are tools that can turn an old photograph into a short animation or create entire "AI clones" trained on old audio, video or written diaries. These technological advancements are taking memorializing the dead to a whole new level, but is it healthy? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke to psychologist Elaine Kasket, who specializes in mental health issues and technology, for some answers. </p>

      <p>As the Trump administration strips away federal data collection agencies' funding and pressures statisticians to produce positive reports, we might wonder whether private data can fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, while statistics reported by the private sector have a place in our economic understanding, they're not necessarily comprehensive, transparent, or free. Also in this episode: EVs see record sales ahead of tax credit end date, Chinese AI firms meet at a conference in Shanghai, and regional Feds give tariff uncertainty updates.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <h1>Automated application systems add insult to injury in a tough job market</h1>

(date: 2025-08-27)
      <p>
      <p>Job growth in the economy has slowed, and the ranks of the long-term unemployed are growing. It makes the indignities of the modern hiring process even more frustrating for those in the market. Job-seekers are navigating a gauntlet of automated application systems set up to whittle down the hundreds — sometimes thousands — of applicants. Only for many to never hear from a human. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino has more from the front lines of algorithmic application hell. </p>

      <h1>Can the president remove a Fed governor?</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26)
      <p>
      <p>Late Monday, President Trump announced plans to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The move is part of his months-long effort to reshape the central bank and pressure it to lower interest rates. But meddling with the Fed's independence could backfire. On today's show, we look at the implications of political interference at the Fed, from the bond market to the U.S. and global economies. Plus, how FEMA's elimination of hazard mitigation programs will affect the country.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <h1>Tariffs come for your morning cup of Joe</h1>

      <p>Americans drink some 450 million cups of coffee each day. Coffee beans from Brazil face a 50% U.S. import duty. And while President Donald Trump's tariffs aim to reshore American production and manufacturing, coffee beans can't really be grown around the U.S. We'll hear what sort of trouble's brewing for coffee sellers as a result. But first, we'll break down the attempted firing of one of America's central bankers.</p>

      <h1>"The president has just made us a higher-risk country"</h1>

      <p>
      <p>That's the conclusion of Karen Petrou at Federal Financial Analytics after President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook last evening. That follows unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Whether or not the move is legal, it raises additional concerns over the independence of America's central bank and the dollar's role as the global reserve currency. And later: What's the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and mortgage rates?</p>

      <h1>Postal services around the world hit pause on shipments to the U.S.</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan and Australia are among the latest countries suspending some postal deliveries to the United States. And it's all down to confusion over tariffs. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month ending the global import tax exemption on small packages worth under $800 entering the U.S. duty-free, a change due to take effect on Friday. Also, Boeing and Korean Air have announced a deal worth $36 billion for over 100 planes.</p>

      <h1>Denmark to end 400 years of letter delivery service</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26)
      <p>
      <p>Across Europe, postal services are grappling with declining letter volumes, amid a rise in digitalization. In Demark, where the decline has been particularly steep, the publicly-owned national postal service, PostNord, is bringing an end to 400 years of letter deliveries, to focus solely on parcels from 2026. And while a private firm will step into the gap, letters are a shrinking business. So as digitalization grows, do letters have a future? The BBC’s Adrienne Murray reports from the Danish capital with more details.</p>
