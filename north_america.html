The online trading platform Robinhood has started allowing its customers
to bet on who will the the election. While its not the first to do so,
it is among the first in the U.S. to jump into a new kind of financial
instrument called “event contracts.” But it’s not without controversy.
We’ll explain. Plus, home price increases appear to be slowing, and
companies aim to make some green off of matcha’s popularity.

id="trump-ally-steve-bannon-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress">Trump
ally Steve Bannon released after serving 4 months in prison for contempt
of Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DANBURY, Conn. — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released
from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for
defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S.
Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury,
Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the
federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in
the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He’s also expected to
resume his podcast Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court
rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his
conviction.</p>
<p>A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of
Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House
Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his
involvement Trump’s efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the
2020 presidential race.</p>
<p>When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a
“political prisoner.”</p>
<p>“I am proud of going to prison,” he said at the time, adding that he
was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a “corrupt” Justice
Department.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next
week’s election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon’s convictions in May.
Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal
team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because
Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon
had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked
executive privilege in front of the committee.</p>
<p>Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court,
alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering,
conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled
to begin in December.</p>

The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to extend after-hours
trading. Pending regulators’ approval, its electronic platform could be
accessible 22 hours a day Monday through Friday, as it looks to compete
with online trading platforms like Robinhood. Then: some profanity-laden
remarks from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon over federal regulation.
Plus, data shows the U.S. economy is king of the hill, top of the heap,
a No. 1. Why doesn’t it always feel that way?

reaches out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — Adidas has reached an out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye
to end all legal proceedings between them, the sportswear brand said on
Tuesday, adding that no money changed hands in the agreement.</p>
<p>Adidas and Ye had been embroiled in multiple lawsuits for the past
two years, since the German company ended a partnership with the rapper
previously known as Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any more open issues, and there is no… money going
either way, and we both move on,” CEO Bjorn Gulden told reporters on a
conference call, declining to give further details of the deal.</p>
<p>“There were tensions on many issues, and… when you put the claims on
the right side and you put the claims on the left side, both parties
said we don’t need to fight anymore and withdrew all the claims,” Gulden
added.</p>

<h2 id="the-energy-transition-is-slowing-down">The Energy Transition Is
Slowing Down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDAxNjgxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTA3MjgwNX0.xi3xVDIVqP-_2mjWfBgE3bMvGBp81KJs0zS3KPJ3Isw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Paris Agreement goal of holding warming to well less than 2 degrees
Celsius over pre-industrial levels is not just increasingly appearing to
be out of reach. The energy transition as a whole is slowing down.
</p>
<p>
This was the stark warning from Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition
Outlook, the energy consultancy’s annual assessment of global progress
toward decarbonizing the economy. “Progress toward a low-carbon energy
system is stumbling on multiple fronts, leaving the world dependent on
fossil fuels for longer,” the outlook’s authors write.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the International Energy Agency’s Global Energy Outlook, which
found
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/climate/global-demand-electricity-rising.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>faster
than expected global electricity demand imperiling Paris goals</u></a>,
and the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report,
which warned that unless emissions were soon wrenched down “it will
become impossible” to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report
completes a grim picture. The question now is less “Can the world meet
the Paris Agreement goals?” and more “How will we manage once we’ve
missed them?”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Wood Mackenzie takes 2.5 degrees of warming as its “base
case,” consistent with other estimates,
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024/executive-summary" target="_blank"><u>including
the IEA’s</u></a>. The report’s authors have little optimism left about
the prospect of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and limiting warming
to 1.5 degrees. Instead, they used to the report to “highlight the
potential of a delayed transition,” in which warming rises to 3 degrees,
said Jonathan Sultoon, Wood Mackenzie’s head of markets and transitions,
on a call with reporters Monday.
</p>
<p>
“We’re in the middle of the 2020s, the decade that’s pivotal to
accelerate the energy transition” Sultoon said, “and no major countries
— and very few companies — are on track to meet their 2030 climate
goals.”
</p>
<p>
To meet even the 2.5 degree warming scenario — one that many scientists
warn could result in difficult to predict and possibly irreversible
climate impacts — would still require that global emissions peak by
2027. Emissions, instead, are rising — by some 1.3% in 2023, according
to the United Nations.
</p>
<p>
The likelihood of slipping from 2.5 degrees to 3 will be determined by
politics, Wood Mackenzie’s analysts argue, whether it’s the war in
Ukraine and unstable Middle East leading countries to reinvest in fossil
fuels for energy security or protectionist policies that block imports
of world-leading low-priced Chinese renewable technology.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“China’s the lower-cost producer in clean tech,” Sultoon said. “Either
the rest of the world needs to rely on Chinese manufacturing to speed
the transition,” or “the West will pay a higher cost — or, in fact,
delay the transition. And it looks far more likely to be that latter
situation than the former.”
</p>
<p>
Policymakers in the rest of the high-emitting world, especially the
United States, are perfectly aware of China’s dominance of much of the
low-carbon technology stack, ranging from solar panels to lithium
refining. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_blank">they’re
seeking to nurture their own industries</a>, seeking both to secure
energy supplies in case of global conflict and to protect native workers
and industries. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em></em></strong>The political or security logic of these
movies might be clear enough, but the Wood Mackenzie analysts are
skeptical of this approach, at least when it comes to advancing
decarbonization. “These dual goals — of decarbonisation and reducing
dependence on metals supply from China — are at odds,” they write. “It
will take years, if not decades, to shift away from China because it
controls up to 70% of global supply chains across several commodities.
It is also the lowest-cost producer. The rest of the world may need to
rely on Chinese manufacturing or be prepared to either pay a higher cost
or delay the transition.”
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the growth in electricity demand, which the IEA
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_blank">also
highlighted</a>. While any scenario that brings down emissions globally
to levels consistent with even 2.5 degrees of warming, let alone 1.5,
will involve a high degree of electrification of processes currently
reliant on the combustion of fossil fuels, new demand for electricity
can have ambiguous effects on overall emissions depending on the ability
of non-carbon-emitting generation to meet that demand.
</p>
<p>
“The quick expansion of electricity supply is often constrained by
transmission infrastructure which takes time to develop,” the report
says. This means new demand could be met by fossil fuels, that the
energy transition could become more expensive than it would be under a
lower demand scenario, or that some crucial amount of electrification
just simply does not happen.
</p>
<p>
“What happens if geopolitical crises, expanded trade restrictions, or
protectionist policies becomes the norm, rather than the exception on a
long-term basis? And where you see slower cost declines for alternative
energy?” asked David Brown, director of Wood Mackenzie’s energy
transition practice. If things continue as they are, that’s a question
we’ll all have to answer. <strong></strong>

id="chinas-xi-pressed-biden-to-alter-language-on-taiwan-sources-say">China’s
Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI — Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S.
President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States
uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according
to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation.</p>
<p>During last November’s Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and
his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S.
official statements.</p>
<p>China wanted the U.S. to say “we oppose Taiwan independence,” rather
than the current version, which is that the United States “does not
support” independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested
anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated
in or were briefed on.</p>
<p>Xi’s aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the
months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person
familiar with the exchanges.</p>
<p>The U.S. has declined to make the change.</p>
<p>The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement
that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan
independence. “The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on
our long-standing One China policy,” the statement read.</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said: “You should ask this question to the
U.S. government. China’s position on the Taiwan issue is clear and
consistent.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s foreign ministry declined comment.</p>
<p>The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists.</p>
<p>The Republic of China remains Taiwan’s formal name and the government
says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign,
independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its
own.</p>
<p>Sensitive issue</p>
<p>For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to
make changes to how it refers to Taiwan’s status, which remains the most
sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed
push at the leader level has not been reported previously.</p>
<p>The United States severed official relations with the government in
Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed
Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own
territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island
under its control.</p>
<p>It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he
has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office
and China’s military has significantly ramped up its activities around
the island in recent years.</p>
<p>The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a
non-starter.</p>
<p>Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by
Washington, said one of the sources.</p>
<p>Leaders in Beijing “would love it if Joe Biden said very different
things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt,” said one senior Biden
administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard
U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence.</p>
<p>During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government
with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend
the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S.
position of “strategic ambiguity.”</p>
<p>Change would reverberate</p>
<p>A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence
would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S.
partners, competitors and adversaries alike.</p>
<p>Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would
interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward
less support for Taipei’s defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time
when Beijing has ramped up military pressure.</p>
<p>China has over the past five years staged almost daily military
activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war
games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part
of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground
targets.</p>
<p>Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S.
policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan’s future through
peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against
Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play.</p>
<p>Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the
status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new
state.</p>
<p>In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing
wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging
Beijing’s position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the
Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence
for the island.</p>
<p>The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden’s term in
office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines
of next month’s G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one
of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part.</p>
<p>The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his
successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former
President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.</p>

Post’s Bezos defends decision to end presidential endorsements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended the newspaper’s
decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate after a report
that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions
following the move.</p>
<p>The decision blocked an endorsement of Democrat Vice President Kamala
Harris, the National Public Radio report said, and many people in
messages on the newspaper’s website criticized Bezos, the billionaire
founder of Amazon.com and rocket company Blue Origin.</p>
<p>Bezos, in an opinion piece late on Monday, said “most people believe
the media is biased” and the Washington Post and other newspapers needed
to boost their credibility.</p>
<p>No candidate was informed or consulted about the decision and that
there was “no quid pro quo,” Bezos said, adding that there was no
connection between the decision and a meeting between Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump and Blue Origin’s CEO on the same
day.</p>
<p>“Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an
election,” Bezos wrote. “What presidential endorsements actually do is
create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending
them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”</p>
<p>The subscription cancellations as of midday represented about 8% of
the paper’s paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes
print as well, reported NPR, which said a series of columnists had
resigned their positions in protest.</p>
<p>The Washington Post declined to comment on the report when contacted
by Reuters.</p>
<p>In a post on Friday, William Lewis, The Washington Post’s publisher
and CEO, said the newspaper would not be making an endorsement of a
presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election, nor in any future
presidential election.</p>
<p>“We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential
candidates,” Lewis wrote.</p>
<p>“The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the
presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,” wrote 20 columnists in an
opinion piece on the Post’s website, adding that it “represents an
abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper
that we love.”</p>

South Korea to confer on North Korean troop deployment to Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — Top diplomatic and military officials from the
United States and South Korea are set to convene in Washington this
Thursday as the two allies closely monitor and express concerns about
North Korea’s deployment of about 10,000 troops to Russia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. officials and analysts say that China could be
displeased by Russia’s growing influence over North Korea, and that if
Beijing chose, it could restrict exports of materials that Pyongyang
might use for munitions production.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin will co-host South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul
and Minister of Defense Kim Yong-hyun to coordinate on pressing security
threats facing the alliance.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during Monday’s
briefing that high on the agenda would be discussion of “North Korea’s
expanding relationship with Russia,” which includes the deployment of
North Korean troops to Russia;  various other provocative actions by
North Korea in recent months; and the U.S. commitment to security in the
Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The consultation between Washington and Seoul will come two weeks
after establishment of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, a
group formed by the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies
to better coordinate enforcement of sanctions against North Korea.</p>
<p>The group said that while “the path to dialogue” with North Korea
remained open, it was committed to “safeguard the global
nonproliferation regime and address the threat arising from the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s [DPRK, North Korea’s official
name] weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which
are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.”</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest that by sending troops to support Russia’s war
on Ukraine, North Korea may gain an opportunity to test the
effectiveness of its ballistic missiles and munitions.</p>
<p>“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear
that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned
about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and
North Korea,” Miller added. He was referring to People’s Republic of
China.</p>
<p>Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies, noted that while China has been supportive of
Russia’s war in Ukraine, North Korea’s involvement introduces an
unsettling dynamic.</p>
<p>“For one,” Cha said, “China does not like Russia to have so much
influence over North Korea.”</p>
<p>Cha added that Beijing could take specific actions, such as curbing
exports of petroleum coke to North Korea, which can be used in munitions
production.</p>
<p>“According to recent public reports, imports of this good [used for
steel production] have dramatically increased while overall trade has
only slowly started to return to normal,” he said.</p>
<p>Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Austin would also
meet with his South Korean counterpart Wednesday, when he will host Kim
at the Pentagon for the 56th U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting. ROK
refers to South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.</p>

<h2 id="biden-hosts-white-house-diwali-reception">Biden hosts White
House Diwali reception</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the start of the five-day
festival of Diwali — the celebration that symbolizes the victory of
light over darkness and is marked by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the
world, especially in India. </p>
<p>Biden began the White House festivities by lighting a small prayer
lamp known as a diya. Several hundred guests — including South Asian
administration officials, elected officials, prominent community members
and others — wore silks and embroidered finery and thronged the White
House’s massive and heavily chandeliered East Room for the
occasion. </p>
<p>But Biden used the occasion to shine a light on someone who was not
in the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris, the most prominent South
Asian American, who was busy on the campaign trail as the election
swiftly approaches. Her late mother immigrated to the United States from
what was then the Indian city of Madras, now called Chennai. </p>
<p>“One of the things we bonded over was the role each of our mothers
played in our lives,” Biden said. “They come from different places,
different generations, different lives, but they shared a basic belief
about America: Only in America is anything possible. Only in
America.”</p>
<p>And, he said, after hundreds of years of struggle, South Asian
Americans have made the U.S. their home. </p>
<p>“Diwali is celebrated openly and proudly here in the White House,” he
said. “And by the way, this is not my house. This is your house.”</p>
<p>The festival starts on the darkest night of the year, per the Hindu
lunar calendar — October 31, according to the Indian government. The day
is a national holiday.</p>
<p>Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was visibly moved by the occasion,
spoke of how his parents’ faith illuminated their path after they
immigrated to the U.S. from India. </p>
<p>“That is the message of Diwali,” he said. ”Choose light always,
whatever the future may bring. Whatever the future may bring, it is our
light and our fierce commitment to one another that will see us through
to a better day.”</p>
<p>And joining the festivities from afar was International Space Station
commander Sunita Williams. Her father immigrated to the U.S. from India;
her mother, from Slovenia. She spoke to the White House crowd via a
recorded message from 420 kilometers (260 miles) above the Earth. </p>
<p>“On this day, I specifically think about my father, who immigrated to
the U.S. from India,” she said. “He kept and shared his cultural roots
by teaching us about Diwali and other Indian festivals. Diwali is a time
of joy, as goodness in the world prevails. I am so thankful to have
grown up in a multicultural household where our parents encouraged us to
seek opportunities and reach for the stars.”</p>
<p>Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential
celebrations of Diwali that date to President George W. Bush’s time in
office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali
celebrations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The festival marks the return of the mythical Lord Ram, named in
Sanskrit scripture as a reincarnation of the god Vishnu, from exile
after 14 years. The people of his kingdom, Ayodhya, lit lamps to
illuminate his path home — a tradition that merrymakers continue today
with lamps and pyrotechnics. Indian Americans are the largest non-mixed
Asian group in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
with nearly 4.4 million people identifying as 100% Indian in
origin. </p>
<p>Today, celebrants around the world honor the occasion with new
clothes, extravagant decorations and massive quantities of sugar-laden
confections.</p>
<p>This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the top
proponent of a Hindu-nationalist movement known as Hindutva, saw a sweet
named in his honor. The so-called “Modi Laddu” — the Modi Ball — is made
of saffron, clarified butter, pistachios, almonds and rose water.</p>
<p>But there is also a vein of bitterness in India’s observance of this
holiday.</p>
<p>Modi was the driving force behind the rebuilding of a Hindu temple in
Ayodhya, on what was thought to be Ram’s birthplace. In 1992, a Hindu
mob demolished a mosque on that site, prompting deadly religious riots
that were the worst since India’s independence, leaving more than 2,000
people dead. Modi spent years raising funds to erect a massive Hindu
temple on the ruins. He opened it earlier this year, saying, “Today, our
Ram has come.”</p>

Marine sentenced to 7 years for white supremacist plot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A former U.S. Marine was sentenced to seven years in
prison Monday for his role in a white supremacist plot to destroy power
facilities. </p>
<p>Jordan Duncan, 29, pleaded guilty in North Carolina in June to aiding
in the manufacture of a firearm. </p>
<p>Duncan and four other men, including two other ex-Marines, were
arrested in 2020 in connection with what authorities described as a
neo-Nazi plot to sow chaos by targeting the power grid. </p>
<p>“We have now brought to justice all five of the defendants involved
in a self-described ‘modern day SS,’ who conspired, prepared, and
trained to attack America’s power grid in the name of violent white
supremacist ideology,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a
statement. </p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray said the group was “inspired by
racially motivated violent extremism.” </p>
<p>“If the defendants had been able to carry out an attack it could have
caused suffering to thousands of American citizens,” Wray said. </p>
<p>The other four defendants were previously sentenced to prison terms
between 21 months and 10 years. </p>
<p>According to court documents, two members of the group were active on
“Iron March,” a neo-Nazi online forum, until it was closed in 2017. They
also recruited the other three people involved. </p>
<p>The group accumulated firearms and produced a video of live-fire
training in the desert near Boise, Idaho, that ended with the phrase
“Come home white man” as the final frame. </p>
<p>Components of the power grid in the northwestern United States were
listed as potential targets in handwritten notes found in the possession
of one of the conspirators.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed
the death of a middle-aged eastern Iowa resident from Lassa fever.</p>
<p>The individual had recently returned from travel to West Africa,
where it is believed the person contracted the virus, the state health
department said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to
confirm the diagnosis of Lassa fever, the state health department said.
The CDC said it assesses the risk to the general public to be extremely
low.</p>
<p>Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen
in the United States.</p>
<p>There have been eight travel-associated cases of Lassa fever in the
United States in the past 55 years, according to the Iowa health
department.</p>
<p>In West Africa, the Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to
humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents.</p>
<p>About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5,000 related
deaths occur in West Africa each year, according to the CDC.</p>

<h2 id="theres-no-easy-way-to-fill-climate-techs-missing-middle">There’s
No Easy Way to Fill Climate Tech’s ‘Missing Middle’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg4ODk3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjYwODg0N30.3dgQqSCEV-aV12c3mQOS3V9Go5t77BxdLdOluYXq1tw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Sometimes it’s called the “missing middle,” sometimes, more ominously,
the “valley of death.” Whatever the terminology, it’s undeniable that a
chasm lies between a climate company’s early funding rounds and its
eventual commercial scale-up, one that’s getting harder and harder to
bridge. From the first half of last year to the first half of this one,
total Series B funding declined by nearly a quarter; beyond Series C
rounds — what the market intelligence platform
<a href="https://www.ctvc.co/a-weak-11-3bn-start-to-2024-climate-tech/?ref=ctvc-by-sightline-climate-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CTVC</u></a>
calls “growth funding” — it declined by a third.
</p>
<p>
“The capital needs of these businesses have just outgrown their early
stage backers,” Frank O’Sullivan, a managing director for S2G Ventures’
energy investments, told me. “But the infrastructure investors have
absolutely no appetite whatsoever for taking on an unproven technology
and scaling.” S2G makes both early stage and growth stage investments,
and O’Sullivan co-authored a
<a href="https://www.s2gventures.com/2023-capital-imbalances-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white
paper</u></a> last year on the problem of the “missing middle.” The
paper found that of the $270 billion in private capital for clean energy
raised between 2017 and 2022, just 20% was allocated to late-stage and
growth-focused investments, while 43% went to earlier rounds and 37%
toward deploying established tech.
</p>
<p>
Of course, some of climate tech’s funding gap can be attributed to
broader trends in the venture market and economic landscape.
Covid-related disruptions and low interest rates led investors to throw
money at promising startups, only to see their valuations drop as
inflation (with rising interest rates to match) and geopolitical
uncertainty cooled down the overheated market. Other companies went
directly onto the public market via special purpose acquisition
companies, only to underperform expectations. “There is capital to be
deployed,” O’Sullivan told me. “But a lot of the companies that need
that capital are struggling, really, to swallow hard and take
significant restructuring of their previous valuations.”
</p>
<p>
With clean tech in particular, there’s also frequently a mismatch
between the abilities of venture firms, which often make their biggest
returns on software startups, and the demands of climate tech. The
latter tends to require huge investments in physical infrastructure and
support for first-of-a-kind projects, and generally has a longer
timeline to profitability than, say, an app. “Venture funding, in some
sense, was built for scaling software companies,” Laura Pierpoint,
managing director of the
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240418137137/en/Prime-Coalition-Announces-Trellis-Climate-to-Accelerate-Deployment-of-First-of-a-Kind-Climate-Projects-Through-Catalytic-Capital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
catalytic capital program</u></a> Trellis Climate, told me. “You’re
talking about a capital light business that generally is creating
something that enters a white space, and for which there’s huge amounts
of market potential.”
</p>
<p>
It’s much more difficult to build expensive infrastructure that aims to
displace fossil fuel facilities and the entire economy that relies on
the cheap, reliable power they provide. So while VCs may be enthusiastic
about taking a relatively small financial bet on a high-potential
early-stage company, that may be all they’re able to do.
</p>
<p>
Trellis, on the other hand, is a part of the climate nonprofit Prime
Coalition and funds first-of-a-kind climate projects with philanthropic
capital. The nonprofit structure and philanthropy-focused funding model
mean that Trellis can take a different tack on missing middle financing
than traditional venture or equity investors. For example, Pierpoint
told me it can choose whether to invest in a company or just a specific
project. Trellis can also help de-risk projects by providing an
“insurance backstop” — basically backup capital in case primary project
funding falls short. “We’re looking at expanding the kinds of resources
and dollars we can bring to the table in general for the ecosystem,
because we think that venture can’t do this alone,” Pierpoint told me.
</p>
<p>
As with all nonprofits, generating big returns isn’t the focus for
Trellis. But for traditional investors, that’s the primary goal. And
while growth investments in more technically mature solutions are likely
to generate consistent returns, O’Sullivan told me they don’t often
provide the rarer but more alluring 10x returns that make early-stage
venture capital particularly enticing. “So it’s a more balanced
portfolio, typically, in that growth equity category. It’s just that you
don’t see the high highs,” he said, explaining that a two to 3x return
on investments is more realistic.
</p>
<p>
Brook Porter, a partner and co-founder at the growth-stage firm G2
Venture Partners, told me that focusing on the missing middle
<em><em>can</em></em> be extremely profitable, though, and that the key
to making real money is correctly identifying a company’s “inflection
point” — that is, when it’s poised for significant growth and impact.
That is, of course, every investor’s dream. But G2’s whole strategy
revolves around identifying exactly when this critical juncture will be,
tracking more than 2,000 companies per year to identify the ones best
poised for breakout scale-up.
</p>
<p>
The firm spun off in 2016 from Kleiner Perkins’ Green Growth Fund, where
Porter and his three co-founders previously worked as senior partners.
This is where they honed their theory of inflection point investing,
<a href="https://g2vp.com/portfolio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funding
companies</u></a> such as Uber, drone-maker DJI, and Enphase Energy.
Porter told me that helping startups move from proof-of-concept to
building “that machine of a business” requires a lot of hand-holding,
and that “there aren’t as many investors with that skill set,” so it
could take a while for this approach to scale.
</p>
<p>
On the other end of the funding spectrum, large institutional investors
like banks, hedge funds, and asset management firms certainly have the
money to help bridge the missing middle, but O’Sullivan and Pierpoint
told me they’re generally more interested in fulfilling their internal
climate mandates by building out more wind and solar, which generates
near-guaranteed returns. These investment giants then look at their
remaining cash and think, “Well, we should do something more avant
garde. Let’s put money into early-stage venture,” O’Sullivan explained.
That’s how many seed and Series A-focused funds raise money.
</p>
<p>
As O’Sullivan sees it, what’s happening now is “a flaw of the structure
of capital allocation at the very highest level.” He thinks we could
start by reorienting incentives such that large investors such as banks,
asset managers, and pension funds get paid in part for helping bring new
climate solutions to market, as opposed to just funding the same old,
same old. That would allow them to write “right-sized checks” on the
order of $50 million to $100 million to ready-to-scale companies —
larger than what a VC firm would write, but smaller than what the big
infrastructure investors are used to.
</p>
<p>
How would those alternate funding models actually work? Well, that’s the
real question. Pierpoint said she’s often asked whether a new kind of
investor or asset class will be necessary to fill the gap, and while she
doesn’t have an answer, what she does know is that the group of climate
tech companies that’s ready to commercialize “can’t wait 15 years until
we have the exact right form of capital.”
</p>
<p>
“There needs to be urgency on the part of philanthropists, on the part
of infrastructure equity investors, on the part of venture capitalists,
to really start showing that we can do this,” Pierpoint told me, “and
that we can bring together the right capital stacks to make this
happen.”

<p class="drop-caps">
For some reason, people keep moving to Phoenix. The population of
Maricopa County, which includes the city and its suburbs, was over 4.4
million in the 2020
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/maricopacountyarizona/PST045223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Census</u></a>,
double what it had been 30 years before. This is despite the fact that
you run the risk of bursting into flames simply by walking down the
street there; this summer, temperatures
<a href="http://phoenicians" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceeded</u></a>
100 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix for a stunning 113 straight days, and
in July
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2024/08/16/phoenix-heat-breaks-over-a-dozen-all-time-records-what-are-they/74831426007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
temperature reached</u></a> a balmy 118.
</p>
<p>
Climate hasn’t been as hot an issue in Arizona this year as immigration,
though the candidates for an open Senate seat have
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/shes-in-denial-gallego-lake-clash-on-climate-water/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disagreed</u></a>
over the reality of climate change and how to deal with extreme heat.
(Democrat Ruben Gallego advocates emissions reductions and more nuclear
power; Republican Kari Lake says if we “Drill baby drill” then everyone
can keep running their air conditioners.) There is genuine uncertainty
about how long the state will
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/climate/arizona-phoenix-permits-housing-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
enough water</u></a> to supply its growing population, but when the
election is over it will be difficult to tell exactly how many votes
were moved by rising temperatures. Joe Biden was the first Democratic
presidential candidate to win Maricopa since Harry Truman, and the
slowly baking county is the most important battleground in that
battleground state.
</p>
<p>
While climate may have seemed like a minor consideration amid all the
talk of fascism, abortion bans, and fictional pet-eating this election
cycle, in some of the states where the election will be decided, it’s
still a vital issue. Particularly when a few thousand votes can
determine who wins — as will probably be the case in multiple states —
it could be far more important than most people realize.
</p>
<p>
In fact, in most of the battlegrounds, one can identify a climate issue
that is profoundly affecting lives and the economy — and might or might
not nudge the election results one way or another. The most obvious case
may be North Carolina, where the western part of the state was ravaged
by Hurricane Helene. In the aftermath, it became clear that Asheville
was not the
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91200111/asheville-has-been-called-a-climate-haven-theres-no-such-thing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
refuge</u></a> some had believed it to be.
</p>
<p>
Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, is a blue island in a red
sea. And while officials scramble to make sure voting sites are
operable, Republicans in the state seem to think the hurricane has given
them an advantage, since they’ve used it to convince people (often with
false claims and conspiracy theories) that the federal government has
abandoned them. The county Democratic chair
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-trump-teams-scramble-votes-north-carolinas-hurricane-damaged-west-2024-10-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
Reuters</u></a> they’ve stopped knocking on Republican voters’ doors
because “we just don’t know about how volatile they might be.” No one is
sure how many people have lost access to voting sites due to the storm,
though one Republican congressman from Maryland
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-freedom-caucus-north-carolina-electors-00185520" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a>
that since many of the affected areas lean red, the state legislature
should just award its electoral votes to Trump.
</p>
<p>
Pennsylvania is another state where Republicans think the climate debate
will work in their favor. Both Trump and Senate candidate David
McCormick have put much of their emphasis on promoting fracking and
accusing their opponents of wanting to ban it, on the presumption that
the issue is a guaranteed winner. But the truth is that Pennsylvanians
are
<a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much
more ambivalent</u></a> about fracking than you might imagine, and there
are now more
<a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean
energy jobs</u></a> in the state than fracking jobs. The counties
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5d08b5d1dd7f4cbba594b193debf75dd#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-19083a7c8ba-layer-13%3A8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
dependent</u></a> on fossil fuel production — including McKean, Warren,
Venango (where Oil City is the largest town) and others — are small to
mid-sized, though heavily Republican; their votes are swamped by those
in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and their surrounding suburbs. It
wouldn’t be a stretch to think that if Harris wins, the frack attack
could fade in the same way coal has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>ceased</u></a>
to be a major campaign issue.
</p>
<p>
There are also places where climate politics are even more subtle.
Consider Bryan County, Georgia, a rapidly growing county not far from
Savannah. It has long been a Republican stronghold — Donald Trump got
two-thirds of the vote there in 2020 — but it’s also one of the jewels
in Georgia’s recent
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-georgia-became-green-manufacturing-capital-2024-3?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinvention</u></a>
as a center of green manufacturing. Production
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/hyundia-metaplant-has-started-production-ahead-of-schedule/ar-AA1rIAKb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just
began</u></a> at the local Hyundai “Metaplant” in the county, where
1,400 workers are building electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Will people in a place where the local economy increasingly revolves
around green manufacturing vote again for a candidate who wants to
rescind the subsidies that allow consumers to buy the very vehicles they
and their neighbors are making? It’s difficult to predict. But the
Republicans who run the state, especially Gov. Brian Kemp, have worked
hard to promote Georgia as a green tech hub while tiptoeing around any
talk of climate change, in a way that hasn’t seemed to damage either
their political or economic fortunes.
</p>
<p>
The politics in these very different places show that economic
transitions can be fodder for arguments on both sides, progress can
produce backlash, and disaster can be exploited by almost anyone cynical
enough to do so. While advocates of climate action might hope that the
candidates who support their favored policies will inevitably have an
advantage as the effects of climate change grow in magnitude, that won’t
always be true.
</p>
<p>
It may be inevitable that over time, climate will become more central to
campaigns. But the ways it is playing out in this election, low-key
though they might be, could be a preview of things to come. The urgency
of the climate crisis won’t make the politics any simpler.

Quarter Pounder returns after E. coli testing rules out beef</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — McDonald’s announced Sunday that Quarter Pounders will
again be on its menu at hundreds of its restaurants after testing ruled
out beef patties as the source of the outbreak of E. coli poisoning tied
to the popular burgers that killed one person and sickened at least 75
others across 13 states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that
slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of
contamination, McDonald’s said in a statement. It said it will resume
selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants — without slivered
onions — in the coming week.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the outbreak had expanded to at least 75 people sick in
13 states, federal health officials said. A total of 22 people had been
hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person has died
in Colorado.</p>
<p>Early information analyzed by the FDA showed that uncooked slivered
onions used on the burgers “are a likely source of contamination,” the
agency said. McDonald’s has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a
California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions
used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come
from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>McDonald’s pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several
states — mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states — when the outbreak
was announced Tuesday. McDonald’s said Friday that slivered onions from
the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of
its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like
airports.</p>
<p>The company said it removed slivered onions sourced from that
facility from its supply chain on Tuesday. McDonald’s said it has
decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs
facility “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>The 900 McDonald’s restaurants that normally received slivered onions
from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of
Quarter Pounders without slivered onions, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>Testing by the Colorado Department of Agriculture ruled out beef
patties as the source of the outbreak, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture received multiple lots of fresh and
frozen beef patties collected from various Colorado McDonald’s locations
associated with the E. coli investigation. All samples were found to be
negative for E. coli, the department said.</p>
<p>Taylor Farms said Friday that it had preemptively recalled yellow
onions sent to its customers from its Colorado facility and continues to
work with the CDC and the FDA as they investigate.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear if the recalled onions were the source of
the outbreak, several other fast-food restaurants — including Taco Bell,
Pizza Hut, KFC and Burger King — pulled onions from some menus in
certain areas this week.</p>
<p>Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases.
At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in
New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan and
one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington, the CDC
reported.</p>
<p>McDonald’s said Friday it didn’t pull the Quarter Pounder from any
additional restaurants and noted that some cases in states outside the
original region were tied to travel.</p>
<p>The CDC said some people who got sick reported traveling to other
states before their symptoms started. At least three people said they
ate at McDonald’s during their travel. Illnesses were reported between
Sept. 27 and Oct. 11.</p>
<p>The outbreak involves infections with E. coli 0157:H7, a type of
bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin. It causes about 74,000
infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000
hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to CDC.</p>
<p>Symptoms of E. coli poisoning can occur quickly, within a day or two
of eating contaminated food. They typically include fever, vomiting,
diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and signs of dehydration — little or no
peeing, increased thirst and dizziness. The infection is especially
dangerous for children younger than 5, people who are elderly, pregnant
or who have weakened immune systems.</p>

European countries match US in startup-friendly laws, report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Seven European countries have changed their laws to
increase employee ownership in startups to rival the U.S. in attracting
talent and investment, while other countries are lagging, a report by
venture capital firm Index Ventures found.</p>
<p>While stock options were integral to Silicon Valley’s success, Europe
has been hampered by bureaucracy and by taxing employees too early,
among other restrictions.</p>
<p>The European Union needs a coordinated industrial policy, rapid
decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace with the U.S.
and China economically, Mario Draghi said in a long awaited report last
month.</p>
<p>Over 500 startup CEOs and founders joined a campaign called “Not
Optional” in 2019 to change rules that govern employee ownership — the
practice of giving staff options to acquire a slice of the company, as
European-based companies compete for talent with U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Portugal and the UK lead European countries in
making changes that match or exceed those of the U.S., while Finland,
Switzerland, Norway and Sweden got lower ratings in the Index
report.</p>
<p>When companies such as Revolut and others go public, that ownership
translates into real money for employees, said Martin Mignot, a partner
at Index and an investor at fintech Revolut, which is valued at $45
billion.</p>

id="missouri-sports-betting-ballot-measure-highlights-national-debate-about-tax-rates">Missouri
sports betting ballot measure highlights national debate about tax
rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The ads promoting a November ballot measure to
legalize sports betting in Missouri tout the potential for millions of
new tax dollars devoted to schools. If voters approve the measure, it’s
a good bet they will see even more ads offering special promotions for
bettors. </p>
<p>Many of those promotional costs — in which sportsbooks provide
cash-like credits for customers to place bets — will be exempt from
state taxes, effectively limiting the new revenue for education. </p>
<p>The Missouri ballot measure highlights an emerging debate among
policymakers over how to tax the rapidly growing industry, which has
spread from one state — Nevada — to 38 states and Washington, D.C.,
since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to legalized sports
wagering in 2018. </p>
<p>“It’s a fledging industry,” said Brent Evans, an assistant finance
professor at Georgia College &amp; State University who has taught
classes on gambling. “So nobody really knows what is a reasonable
tax.” </p>
<p>Since authorizing sports betting, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and
Washington, D.C., all have already raised or restructured their tax
rates. And Colorado and Virginia have pared back the tax deductions they
originally allowed. </p>
<p>Tax rates range from a low of 6.75% in states such Iowa to 51% in
states such as New York. That tax gap is even wider, because Iowa allows
promotional bets to be deducted from taxable revenue while New York does
not. </p>
<p>About half the states allow tax deductions for promotional costs.
It’s a common way of enticing people to start — or continue — making
bets. But in the short-term, it also can decrease the tax revenue
available for governments and schools. </p>
<p>Missouri’s proposed 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue is below
the national average of 19% that sportsbooks paid to states last year.
Because of deductions for “free play,” there could be some months in
which sportsbooks owe nothing to the state. Missouri’s proposed
constitutional amendment acknowledges that possibility, stating that
negative balances can be carried over from one month to the next until
revenue rises enough to owe taxes. </p>
<p>Unlike in some states, Missouri’s amendment caps the amount of
promotional credits that can be deducted from taxable revenue, at 25% of
all wagers. But it appears unlikely that cap would come into play. An
analysis conducted by consultant Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming for
amendment supporters projects promotional bets will comprise around 8%
of total wagers in Missouri’s first year of sports betting, declining
after that. </p>
<p>The Missouri proposal “is very much in line with what has worked and
been effective in other states,” said Jack Cardetti, a spokesman for
Winning for Missouri Education, the group backing the measure. </p>
<p>After voters narrowly approved it, Colorado launched sports betting
in 2020 with a 10% tax rate and full deductions for promotional bets. It
logged $2.7 billion of total bets during its first full fiscal year,
yielding $8.1 million in taxes, just slightly below legislative
projections. But Colorado changed its law starting in 2023 to cap
promotional tax deductions at 2.5% of total bets, gradually declining to
1 .75% by July 2026. </p>
<p>Colorado’s sports betting tax revenue has since risen to over $30
million in its most recent fiscal year. That growth led lawmakers to
place a proposal on the November ballot seeking permission for the state
to keep more than the original $29 million limit on sports betting tax
revenue. </p>
<p>Capping tax deductions for promotional bets is a good step, said
Richard Auxier, a principal policy associate at the nonprofit Tax Policy
Center. But he questions why some states exempt them from taxes in the
first place. </p>
<p>“We don’t give out free samples of cannabis when a state legalizes
cannabis,” Auxier said. “Is this something you want to be subsidizing
through your state tax policy — to encourage people to gamble?” </p>
<p>The Missouri amendment was placed on the November ballot by
initiative petition after legislation to legalize sports betting
repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. The $43 million campaign — a
record for a Missouri ballot measure — has been been funded entirely by
DraftKings and FanDuel, which dominate the nationwide sports betting
marketplace. If the measure passes, the companies could apply for two
statewide licenses to conduct online sports betting. The amendment
authorizes additional sports betting licenses for Missouri casinos and
professional sports teams. </p>
<p>The $14 million opposition campaign has been funded entirely by
Caesars Entertainment, which operates three of Missouri’s 13 casinos.
Although Caesars generally supports sports betting, it opposes “the way
this measure is written,” said Brooke Foster, a spokesperson for the
opposition group Missourians Against the Deceptive Online Gambling
Amendment. </p>
<p>In some other states, sports betting is run through casinos. Though
research is limited, a study of seven states released last year found
that casino gambling revenue declined as online sports betting
increased. </p>
<p>“There will definitely be a shift from placing bets in a physical
space with a Missouri incorporated casino versus hopping on an app in
your living room,” Foster said. </p>
<p>The effect of different tax rates can be seen in Illinois and New
Jersey, which spearheaded the court challenge leading to widespread
legal sports betting. People in each state placed between $11.5 billion
and $12 billion of sports bets last year, resulting in $1 billion of
revenue for sportsbooks after winnings were paid to customers, according
to figures from the American Gaming Association. </p>
<p>New Jersey took in $129 million in tax revenue, based on a 14.25% tax
rate for online sports bets and a 9.75% tax rate with some promotional
deductions for sports bets at casinos and racetracks. Illinois took in
$162 million of tax revenue — one-quarter more than New Jersey — with a
15% tax rate in most places and no promotional deductions. </p>
<p>But Illinois officials weren’t satisfied with those results.
Beginning in July, Illinois imposed a progressive tax scale, starting
with a 20% tax on sports betting revenue of less than $30 million and
rising to a 40% rate on revenue exceeding $200 million. </p>
<p>Some sportsbooks representatives had raised the possibility of
leaving Illinois if tax rates rose. But that hasn’t happened. </p>
<p>There’s also not much evidence that sportsbooks worsen the odds for
wagers in states where they pay higher taxes, said Joe Weinert,
executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting
firm. </p>
<p>“The sports betting operators compete vigorously for bettors,” he
said, “and how you compete vigorously is to offer attractive odds and
good promotions.”</p>

id="how-to-prepare-for-potential-health-effects-of-upcoming-end-to-daylight-saving-time">How
to prepare for potential health effects of upcoming end to daylight
saving time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad:
It’ll be dark as a pocket by late afternoon for the next few months in
the U.S. </p>
<p>Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time next Sunday, Nov. 3,
which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed.
Standard time will last until March 9 when we will again “spring
forward” with the return of daylight saving time. </p>
<p>That spring time change can be tougher on your body. Darker mornings
and lighter evenings can knock your internal body clock out of whack,
making it harder to fall asleep on time for weeks or longer. Studies
have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the
March time change. </p>
<p>“Fall back” should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust
your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the
dark or trying exercise while there’s still enough light. Some people
with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to
the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle,
too. </p>
<p>Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and
American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it’s time to do away with
time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with
the sun — and human biology. </p>
<p>Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do
— mostly in Europe and North America — the date that clocks are changed
varies. </p>
<p>Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don’t change and stay on standard
time. </p>
<p>Here’s what to know about the twice yearly ritual. </p>
<p>How the body reacts to light </p>
<p>The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and
darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that
determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns
change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into
hard-to-wake teens. </p>
<p>Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone
called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light
in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that
surge and the cycle gets out of sync. </p>
<p>And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing
things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and
metabolism. </p>
<p>How do time changes affect sleep? </p>
<p>Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules —
because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay
the same. </p>
<p>That’s a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived.
About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus
hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don’t get the
recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline,
obesity and numerous other problems. </p>
<p>How to prepare for the time change </p>
<p>Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their
bed times little by little in the days before the change. There are ways
to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset
your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. </p>
<p>Will the U.S. ever get rid of the time change? </p>
<p>Lawmakers occasionally propose getting rid of the time change
altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan
bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, proposes making daylight saving
time permanent. Health experts say the lawmakers have it backward —
standard time should be made permanent.</p>

id="biden-marks-anniversary-of-pittsburgh-synagogue-attack-that-killed-11">Biden
marks anniversary of Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden on Sunday marked the sixth
anniversary of a gunman’s deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue and
called out what he called an “appalling surge of antisemitism” amid the
war in Gaza. </p>
<p>The 2018 attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash,
New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the
synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.
Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in
the attack, the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that the attack “shattered families,
pierced the heart of the Jewish community, and struck the soul of our
nation.” But he said that in the years since, the Jewish community “has
also shown the country how to courageously turn pain into purpose”
launching “a global initiative to counter hate and hate-fueled
violence.” </p>
<p>Biden noted that the remembrance of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack
comes weeks after the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel “during
which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage and
committed horrific acts of sexual assault.” </p>
<p>He said the trauma and losses of Oct. 7 are made worse by “the
appalling surge of antisemitism against Jews in America and around the
world.” </p>
<p>The attack sparked a war between Israel and the militant group Hamas
and has resulted in widespread destruction and civilian deaths in
Gaza. </p>
<p>Biden said his administration was implementing a national strategy to
counter antisemitism, including securing $1.2 billion for security of
nonprofits such as synagogues and Jewish community centers and day
schools. He also cited the Justice Department’s investigation and
prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and said his administration had
“put colleges on notice that antisemitism is discrimination” and barred
under laws protecting civil rights. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris also cited a rise in antisemitism in a
statement marking the anniversary of the Pittsburgh attack. </p>
<p>“I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish
people in the United States and around the world and will always call
out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it,” she said. </p>
<p>The Pittsburgh attacker was sentenced to death last year after being
convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. </p>
<p>In June, ground was broken for a new complex on the Pittsburgh site
that is to include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and
museum along with a memorial to the slain worshipers from three
congregations.</p>

id="on-navajo-nation-push-to-electrify-more-homes-on-vast-reservation">On
Navajo Nation, push to electrify more homes on vast reservation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HALCHITA, Utah — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky
Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the
sprawling Navajo Nation. </p>
<p>In five days’ time, their home would be connected to the power grid,
replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No
longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home
heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face
interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis
can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an
evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. </p>
<p>“We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,” Gillis
said. </p>
<p>Many Navajo families still live without running water and
electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get
services to far-flung homes on the 70,000-square-kilometer
(27,000-square-mile) Native American reservation that lies in parts of
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators,
which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. </p>
<p>Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in
2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and
everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation,
it further stalled the process. </p>
<p>Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every
Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal
infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest
intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. </p>
<p>“We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left
out,” said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal
Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric,
water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. </p>
<p>For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more
Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light
Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside
utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes
and extend power lines. </p>
<p>But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West
Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and
the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can
take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes
near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet
strict regulations around development in the area. </p>
<p>About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the
remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said
Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the
utility. </p>
<p>This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid.
Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their
homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could
take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. </p>
<p>Until this month, Black and Gillis’ solar panels that the utility
installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before
their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days
to recharge. </p>
<p>“You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a
cloudy day,” Gillis said. </p>
<p>Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power
poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in
which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a
red sand road from the main power line to the couple’s home. </p>
<p>“The lights are brighter,” Black remarked after her home was
connected. </p>
<p>In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated
for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32
billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo
Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal
utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration’s
climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families
to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that
money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. </p>
<p>Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another
150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. </p>
<p>For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo
Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12-year wait. They currently live
in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs but have worked
on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could
spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still
lives. </p>
<p>It would make life simpler, Priscilla said. “Because otherwise,
everything, it seems like, takes twice as long to do.”</p>

id="venom-the-last-dance-misses-projections-as-superhero-films-grip-on-theaters-loosens">‘Venom:
The Last Dance’ misses projections as superhero films’ grip on theaters
loosens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “Venom: The Last Dance” showed less bite than expected at
the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according
to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote
franchise’s previous entries.</p>
<p>Projections for the third “Venom” film from Sony Pictures had been
closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from
the first two “Venom” films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2
million, while the 2021 follow-up, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” opened
with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>“The Last Dance,” starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his
body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a
profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and
marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most
comic-book films.</p>
<p>But “The Last Dance” is also performing better overseas.
Internationally, “Venom: The Last Dance” collected $124 million over the
weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China.
That’s good enough for one of the best international weekends of the
year for a Hollywood release.</p>
<p>Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience
scores (a franchise-low “B-” CinemaScore) have been good for the film
scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel.</p>
<p>The low weekend for “Venom: The Last Dance” also likely insures that
superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years,
not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a
film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise
Entertainment.</p>
<p>Following on the heels of the “Joker: Folie à Deux” flop, Gross
estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion
worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel’s “Kraven the Hunter,” due
out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,”
the genre hasn’t, overall, been dominating the way it once did. In 2018,
for example, superhero films accounted for more than $7 billion in
global ticket sales.</p>
<p>Last week’s top film, the Paramount Pictures horror sequel “Smile 2,”
dropped to second place with $9.4 million. That brings its two-week
total to $83.7 million worldwide.</p>
<p>The weekend’s biggest success story might have been “Conclave,” the
papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes and directed by Edward Berger
(“All Quiet on the Western Front”). The Focus Features release, a major
Oscar contender, launched with $6.5 million in 1,753 theaters.</p>
<p>That put “Conclave” into third place, making it the rare
adult-oriented drama to make a mark theatrically. Some 77% of ticket
buyers were over the age of 35, Focus said. With a strong opening and
stellar reviews, “Conclave” could continue to gather momentum both with
moviegoers and Oscar voters.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

id="what-is-givingtuesday-annual-day-of-charitable-giving-approaches">What
is GivingTuesday? Annual day of charitable giving approaches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday
after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of
the year for nonprofits in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for charitable
organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday.</p>
<p>This year, GivingTuesday is on December 3.</p>
<p>How did GivingTuesday start?</p>
<p>The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y
in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It’s
grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote
giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local
relevance, such as holidays.</p>
<p>Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working
on topics about everyday giving. It collects data from a wide range of
sources such as payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving
software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of
charitable-giving account.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of GivingTuesday?</p>
<p>The hashtag was started to promote generosity, and the nonprofit
continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.</p>
<p>For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and
engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email
and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.
Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising
campaigns, and many smaller, local groups also participate.</p>
<p>Nonprofits don’t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday,
the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it,
although GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it
remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however
they like.</p>
<p>Has GivingTuesday been successful?</p>
<p>That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown
far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day
has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center
charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the United
States and around the world.</p>
<p>For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for
nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major
donors and leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is
the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to
reach their budget targets for the following year.</p>
<p>Donations on GivingTuesday in 2022 and 2023 reached $3.1 billion, an
increase from $2.7 billion in 2021. While that’s a lot to raise in a
single day, the trend last year was flat and with fewer donors giving,
which the organization said is a worrying sign.</p>

<p>The divide between urban and rural voters is a key indicator in U.S.
electoral politics. Cities favoring Democrats and rural areas favoring
Republicans isn’t new. But since 2000, the gap has grown dramatically.
What is behind this trend, and why is it so important? The answer is
partly economic — but there are also complex cultural factors involved.

astronaut released from hospital after return from space station</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A NASA astronaut who was hospitalized upon return from
the International Space Station for an unspecified medical condition was
released Saturday in “good health,” the U.S. space agency said. </p>
<p>The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida
early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital
laboratory.   </p>
<p>NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the
reason, citing medical privacy.   </p>
<p>However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to
the Johnson Space Center in Houston “in good health and will resume
normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.”   </p>
<p>On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal
re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was
without incident, NASA said.   </p>
<p>But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an
“additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an
abundance of caution,” it added, without elaborating. </p>
<p>NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps,
and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were all flown to Ascension
Sacred Heart Pensacola.   </p>
<p>Three were subsequently released, while one remained at the hospital
“under observation as a precautionary measure.”</p>
