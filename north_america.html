      <h1>Expect a spendy but price-conscious holiday season</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>Retailers are getting ready for the most magical time of their year: holiday shopping season. Holiday spending is expected to tick up, though that's driven mostly by higher prices. We'll hear more. Plus, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund supports mission-driven lenders operating in rural, tribal, and otherwise underserved parts of the country. President Donald Trump recently tried to fire the entire staff of the CDFI as part of recent federal job cuts.</p>

      <h1>Thousands in the UK take Johnson & Johnson to court</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A major legal claim has been filed in the United Kingdom against pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, accusing the firm of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos. The case mirrors American litigation, where billions of dollars in damages have been awarded to plaintiffs. Plus, President Donald Trump says India will stop buying Russian oil. And, how can countries outside the biggest players — the U.S. and China — get plugged into AI infrastructure?</p>

      <h1>Documents show ICE wants a nonstop social media surveillance system</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement wants to set up an around-the-clock social media surveillance network, according to public documents reviewed by WIRED magazine.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, ICE would partner with private contractors to monitor platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for information and leads that can be passed on to officers in the field.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Dell Cameron, senior writer at WIRED who broke the story, about the proposed structure of this new surveillance program.</p>

(date: 2025-10-15)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. retail and supply chain sectors are slowing down — September’s Logistics Managers’ Index hits its lowest point since March. Many retailers are stopping shipments after stocking up early to avoid tariffs. Ongoing trade uncertainty and rising costs have companies fretting about the long term. Also in this episode: Gen Z plans to spend less this holiday season, tariffs muddle international library lending, and Colorado colleges partner with the private sector to expand skilled jobs training.</p>

      <p>It’s a big week for bank earnings. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported quarterly results on Tuesday; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report on Wednesday. Overall, banks are pulling in plenty of revenue — especially from their investment banking and trading departments. But the old-fashioned business of lending out money has been more of a mixed bag. We'll unpack. Also on the show: a major cryptocurrency scam and the economics of Broadway contract negotiations.</p>

      <h1>When the government shuts down, tribal communities get the shaft</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>The effects of government shutdowns are felt particularly deeply in tribal communities across the United States. That’s because the federal government has a constitutional obligation to fund services in Indian Country. But when the government closes, tribal nations are left to pick up the tab. Marketplace’s Savannah Peters joins Kimberly to explain how tribal communities get caught up in the federal government’s dysfunctional budget process and why tribal leaders argue this needs to change.</p>
<p>Here’s everything we talked about today:</p>

      <h1>Fewer Chinese international students at American universities</h1>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>There are almost 250,000 Chinese students in the U.S. this fall. That's a 36% drop from the 2017 peak. For Chinese students still wanting to study abroad, America remains the top destination, but geopolitics, safety concerns, and persistent inflation are making the U.S. a less attractive place to receive a higher education. And later, Switzerland is facing 39% tariffs from the U.S. How are businesses there faring?</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Paychecks are grinding to a halt for federal employees as the government shutdown enters its third week. A 2019 law entitles furloughed workers to back pay (though the Trump administration is claiming otherwise), but there are no pay guarantees for millions of government contract workers, who outnumber federal employees nearly two to one. Also on the show: which new tariffs kicked in last night, and why megadeals are driving merger and acquisition activity.</p>

Plus, delegates are in London for U.N. talks aimed at reducing the environmental impact of global shipping. And, we'll hear about the impact of tariffs on Swiss businesses.</p>

(date: 2025-10-14)
      <p>
      <p>Countries all over the world use technology to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated.</p>
<p>But Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University said the technology is also often employed in ways that are too intrusive and can act like digital shackles. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.</p>

      <h1>AI companies are eyeing your shopping cart and your data</h1>

(date: 2025-10-13)
      <p>
      <p>Open AI has added a checkout feature to ChatGPT, partnering with Etsy and Shopify to let users purchase some items from select merchants. OpenAI says ChatGPT's answers are still organic and unsponsored. But why not offer a seamless way to buy things that come up in certain responses?</p>
<p>Eventually this could lead to so-called “agentic” shopping: letting AI research items, pick one, and then buy it on our behalf. Marketplace's Nova Safo spoke with colleague Meghan McCarty Carino about what AI companies stand to gain from integrating e-commerce tech.</p>

      <p>Wanna put a wager on, well, just about anything? Try a prediction market. Competing industry giants Kalshi and Polymarket both saw major investment this week, and for good reason. Though they don’t look it on paper, both function as (extremely lucrative) sports betting platforms but don't face the regulations of sports betting platforms. In this episode, we bet on where that legal loophole is headed. Plus: Expect car sales to sputter as the EV tax credit ends and tariffs drive up costs, and the case for replacing subsidized air travel with a more robust rural bus system.</p>

      <h1>Why government shutdowns hit tribes especially hard</h1>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>Federal programs and funding play an important role in Indian Country, because of the government’s trust responsibility to provide or fund services to tribal nations in exchange for ceded land that now comprises the United States. That relationship also means that shutdowns hit tribal nations particularly hard. We'll learn what that means for services like health care and food distribution programs. Then, a lifelong Las Vegas resident reflects on the city's economic slowdown.</p>

(date: 2025-10-10)
      <p>
      <p>The ongoing government shutdown has caused a lapse in the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act,a law that's key to protecting the nation against major cyberattacks. Plus, OpenAI this week made a huge investment in chipmaker AMD, the latest in a round of blockbuster deals. And Google said it will be updating its smart home devices with its advanced artificial intelligence, Gemini.

      <h1>An economic vocab lesson for the Trump era</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Today we’re all getting smarter about some of the economic and political terms dominating the headlines these days. Terms like “authoritarianism” and “state capitalism” that have been hotly debated during the second Trump administration.

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Starting Friday, federal workers will be getting their first paychecks for smaller-than-usual amounts as a result of the government shutdown. That’s likely to especially sting federal employees who still have to show up to work, including TSA agents and air traffic controllers. They've helped up the pressure to end shutdowns before. Could they do it again? Plus, we'll unpack how C-suite execs are currently feeling about tariffs and artificial intelligence.</p>

      <h1>The lights of Las Vegas' economy have lost some glow</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)
      <p>
      <p>Las Vegas is arguably the discretionary spending capital of the country, if not the entire world. This makes it a good barometer for understanding the current economy — not just of one city or state, but the entire nation. And right now, Vegas is grappling with declining tourism and a high unemployment rate. We'll visit Sin City to learn more about the slump. Plus, why is China stepping up controls on rare earth metal exports?</p>

Also, China has tightened export controls on rare earth metals, which are vital to a range of electronic devices, including military hardware.</p>

(date: 2025-10-09)

      <p>A recent study of nearly 20,000 University of California, San Diego Health workers found cybersecurity training reduced the likelihood of successful phising attacks by just 2%.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Ariana Mirian, senior researcher at the cybersecurity firm Censys and co-author of the study, who explained that many workers are just not taking those training programs seriously enough.</p>

      <h1>Using tariffs to help farmers ... harmed by tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <h1>The politicization of the National Guard</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>A growing list of U.S. cities are set to see National Guard troops in their communities as President Trump explores ways to deploy the military on American soil. But legal challenges are piling up. On today’s show, Kimberly talks with Patrick Eddington, senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute, about the changing role of the National Guard and why Trump’s use of the Guard defies precedent.</p>

      <h1>The ACA subsides at the heart of the shutdown fight</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Mark Anthony Dyson, author of the Job Scam Report newsletter, about how to spot scams.</p>

And, although the artificial intelligence industry is worth close to $250 billion, some businesses are rejecting its use altogether. We'll hear from them.</p>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p>The gap between how high-income and low-income Americans are faring in this economy is growing. One example? Fast food restaurants are struggling while sit-down joints that cater to wealthier customers are A-OK. Also in this episode: “Every Screen on the Planet” author Emily Baker-White talks geopolitics behind the U.S.-China TikTok deal and a Wyoming solar panel company preps for the end of federal subsidies for residential installation.</p>

      <p>Federal worker layoffs are near, according to Trump administration officials. Earlier this week, the president said he would use the government shutdown to target &quot;Democrat things.&quot; And a shutdown with layoffs may have more serious economic consequences than your average shutdown. For more on that we turn to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. Also on today's show: China launches a new visa to attract more international STEM talent.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Unemployment remains relatively low, but the labor market is slowing down. Private payroll company ADP estimates the private sector lost 32,000 jobs last month. Hiring has slowed, and it's taking longer for jobseekers to find work. And where there are people with anxiety and fear, there are scammers to prey on them. The Federal Trade Commission says reports of job scams tripled over the past four years. But first, why the Trump administration is sending memos to universities and what Democrats are demanding to reopen the government.</p>

      <h1>How the government shutdown will affect federal workers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The slow-moving train wreck we've been watching unfold for a week, has indeed wrecked: the government officially shutdown at midnight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed, and the Trump administration is threatening to fire others. Later in the show, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour sits down with Susan M. Collins, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. They'll discuss tariffs, a cooling labor market and how the central bank is affected by a government shutdown.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The role of artificial intelligence in mental health care is an unsettled issue. States including Illinois, Utah, and Nevada limit or ban the use of AI for therapy. And researchers say such conversations can sometimes veer off course and even be dangerous.</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>While the stock market appears unconcerned about potential red flags in this economy, the bond market's a bit more cautious. As Washington nears a shutdown and the labor market flags, Treasury yields are ticking down. But demand for those safer, long-term bonds hasn’t been uniform. Plus: Trump adds to existing tariffs on Canadian lumber, OpenAI wades into e-commerce waters, and Abha Bhattarai at the Washington Post talks about the “stuck economy.”</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry. Higher education also uses the H-1B visa, and that fee could be a big problem there. Brendan Cantwell, a professor at Michigan State University, unpacks what these changes mean for universities. But first, Dr. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds joins us to discuss President Trump's latest tariffs.</p>

      <p>Colleges and universities are dealing with a growing problem of college admission essays being written by artificial intelligence. Rather than try to figure out which essays are AI-generated, some schools are turning to an alternative approach: Have students submit a video instead.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Anne Kim, senior editor at Washington Monthly magazine who recently wrote about this new strategy that's gaining steam in higher education.</p>

      <p>Pending home sales rose in August, boosted by a slight drop in mortgage rates. Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool. Also in this episode: Banks respond to the Fed rate cut, retailers prepare for holiday hiring, and tech companies hope nuclear is the answer to data center energy demand.</p>

      <h1>Consumer spending outpaced income — again</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row. Thanks to tariff-induced price bumps, consumers are dipping into savings and using credit cards to keep up with their typical spending. In this episode, how long can consumers stay resilient? Plus: LA businesses prepare for ongoing ICE raids, a ski group vies to manage U.S. surfing at the 2028 Olympics, and an artist’s work changes in the age of e-commerce.</p>

      <h1>Trump announces a new round of tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump has ordered steep new tariffs on imported drugs, home furnishings, and trucks. The president's import taxes are pushing inflation higher. But that's not slowing consumer spending.</p>

      <h1>The status of a potential U.S.-owned TikTok</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more. And later, we'll learn why so much foreign investment is still flowing to the U.S.</p>

      <h1>Why buyers have wracked up so much car loan debt</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a company called Tricolor abruptly filed for bankruptcy. The Texas-based firm offered auto loans to buyers with poor (or no) credit ratings. That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more. Plus, President Donald Trump unveils a new batch of tariffs, and D.C. braces for more economic pain ahead of a looming shutdown.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> President Donald Trump has announced new tariffs, including a 100% levy on branded or patented drug imports from Oct. 1 onward — unless a company is building a factory in the United States. Which countries will be most affected? Then, Ethiopia has opened a controversial megadam built on the Nile River after 14 years of construction. It's at the center of a diplomatic spat with countries that fear their water supplies could be affected.</p>

      <p>The &quot;silver tsunami&quot; of aging Americans is often seen as a potential way to alleviate U.S. housing affordability woes. But an influx of empty-nester homes into the market may not have much impact.</p>

      <p>A lunch out may give you sticker shock, but a popping boba won't pop the budget, right? While some consumers are trying to be more money-conscious, many are still spending big on eating and drinking out. Chains like Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are all trying to cash in — in part by offering fancier, pricier, non-alcoholic drinks. Also on the program, we'll check in on New England's economy.</p>
