      <h1>Europe plans to build a high-tech 'drone wall'</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Some European Union countries have backed plans for the new defense system to keep out unmanned aircraft from Russia. But how will it work, and what's the price tag? In France hundreds of thousands of workers have walked out over looming budget cuts and pension reforms. Today marks the 75th anniversary of The Turing Test, to tell the difference between a human and a machine. And we hear how Chilean businesses are adapting — or not — to an ageing workforce.</p>

      <p>
      <p>So far this year, LA defense tech companies have raised $4 billion in funding — more than double last year's haul, according to Los Angeles Times tech reporter Queenie Wong. She told Marketplace’s Nova Safo that venture capital firms are increasingly embracing military-focused tech.</p>

      <h1>The data dogs are howling</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The government shutdown means crucial jobs data will likely be postponed, right as the Fed weighs its next move. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a self-described “data dog,” tells us how central bank officials plan to pivot. He also discusses Fed independence, transitory inflation, and rate cut pacing. After that: fiscal calendars vary by sector, synthetic dye removal will ripple through the food chain, and ADP reports more sour employment data.</p>

      <p>Markets are having to digest a lot right now. There's the government shutdown, plus new private payroll data showing the economy lost jobs in September. Susan Schmidt, portfolio manager at Exchange Capital Resources, joins us to break it down. Also on the show: the FAFSA portal is open. We look at what's different with this year's federal student aid applications and how the government shutdown could impact the process. Then, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour continues his conversation with Susan M. Collins, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The slow-moving train wreck we've been watching unfold for a week, has indeed wrecked: the government officially shutdown at midnight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed, and the Trump administration is threatening to fire others. Later in the show, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour sits down with Susan M. Collins, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. They'll discuss tariffs, a cooling labor market and how the central bank is affected by a government shutdown.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The role of artificial intelligence in mental health care is an unsettled issue. States including Illinois, Utah, and Nevada limit or ban the use of AI for therapy. And researchers say such conversations can sometimes veer off course and even be dangerous.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Jenna Glover, chief clinical officer at the mental health care platform Headspace, which launched an AI assistant, Ebb, last year.</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>While the stock market appears unconcerned about potential red flags in this economy, the bond market's a bit more cautious. As Washington nears a shutdown and the labor market flags, Treasury yields are ticking down. But demand for those safer, long-term bonds hasn’t been uniform. Plus: Trump adds to existing tariffs on Canadian lumber, OpenAI wades into e-commerce waters, and Abha Bhattarai at the Washington Post talks about the “stuck economy.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry. Higher education also uses the H-1B visa, and that fee could be a big problem there. Brendan Cantwell, a professor at Michigan State University, unpacks what these changes mean for universities. But first, Dr. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds joins us to discuss President Trump's latest tariffs.</p>

      <p>Colleges and universities are dealing with a growing problem of college admission essays being written by artificial intelligence. Rather than try to figure out which essays are AI-generated, some schools are turning to an alternative approach: Have students submit a video instead.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Anne Kim, senior editor at Washington Monthly magazine who recently wrote about this new strategy that's gaining steam in higher education.</p>

      <p>Pending home sales rose in August, boosted by a slight drop in mortgage rates. Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool. Also in this episode: Banks respond to the Fed rate cut, retailers prepare for holiday hiring, and tech companies hope nuclear is the answer to data center energy demand.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing a special bonus episode from “How We Survive.” It’s a conversation between host Amy Scott, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and Pulitzer Prize winning science writer Elizabeth Kolbert. Together, they dig into how the climate crisis is triggering economic disruption. Plus, some solutions to be hopeful about.</p>
<p>And, we get a peek into Kolbert’s forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/781145/life-on-a-little-known-planet-by-elizabeth-kolbert/">”Life on a Little-Known Planet: Dispatches from a Changing World.”</a> In this collection of her most influential essays, Kolbert takes readers around the globe, telling stories about caterpillars, whale conversations and the people trying to preserve our planet.</p>
<p>This conversation was recorded live, over Zoom, in front of an audience. You can watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5QiojlV640">here</a>. The event is presented by Odoo with additional underwriting support from The Economist.</p>

      <h1>On the brink of a shutdown, markets don't care</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump and congressional leaders are meeting at the White House on Monday to try and avoid a government shutdown. But both sides are digging their heels in. This brinksmanship is happening the same week we are set to get some pretty important government data. Julia Coronado, founder and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, and a professor at the University of Texas-Austin, joins us to talk about it. Plus, has Canada lost its trade dispute with the U.S.?</p>

      <h1>Gloom in oil country</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Texas oil and gas firms are feeling pessimistic about the upcoming year. In the latest Dallas Fed survey, energy firms reported lower production, increased costs and heightened uncertainty. Oil is a good chunk of the Texas economy, and the Texas economy is a good chunk of the U.S. economy — around 9%. Also on the show: auto parts manufacturer First Brands files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the USDA revives its farm-to-school grant program.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The decision at Toyota in Brazil comes after intense storms halted production at its factories in the state of Sao Paulo, and many of the workers will be paid in full during the closed period. Hackers have attempted to recruit the BBC's cyber correspondent into helping them infiltrate the broadcaster's systems. And has Canada lost in the trade war with the U.S.? Over the past month, it’s removed billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on American goods.</p>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p>Researchers at several universities tested how successful artificial intelligence can be at political persuasion, and found some AI chatbots were 40-50% more successful than a static message at getting people to change their views. And those views often stayed changed weeks later.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row. Thanks to tariff-induced price bumps, consumers are dipping into savings and using credit cards to keep up with their typical spending. In this episode, how long can consumers stay resilient?

      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more. And later, we'll learn why so much foreign investment is still flowing to the U.S.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, a company called Tricolor abruptly filed for bankruptcy. The Texas-based firm offered auto loans to buyers with poor (or no) credit ratings. That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more. Plus, President Donald Trump unveils a new batch of tariffs, and D.C. braces for more economic pain ahead of a looming shutdown.</p>

While some consumers are trying to be more money-conscious, many are still spending big on eating and drinking out. Chains like Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell, and McDonald's are all trying to cash in — in part by offering fancier, pricier, non-alcoholic drinks.

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Apple has called for the European Union's antitrust watchdogs to scrap some of its tech regulations, which it says lead to a worse experience for users. It's not the first time Apple has voiced its opposition to Europe's Digital Markets Act. We hear more. Plus, China has — for the first time — set a target for reducing carbon emissions. And, a Dutch village famous for its windmills is planning to charge visitors to see them.</p>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p>The EV tax credit expires September 30, and Americans have been rushing to take advantage before the deadline. But according to reporting from Marketplace’s Henry Epp, many dealerships are facing new friction when processing tax credits with the IRS.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Epp about the new IRS requirements and how dealerships are handling the changes.</p>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p>Disney’s streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN — will see price hikes come October 21. They aren’t alone. As the streaming wars escalate, companies have switched focus to profit over customer volume, while consumers whittle down their subscriptions. Also in this episode: A soybean farmer faces trade war realities, manufacturers pour cash into new equipment, and Warren Littlefield, producer of “Fargo,&quot; “The Handmaid’s Tale” and more discusses the TV business with Kai.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Every fall for about three decades, the U.S. Department of Agriculture comes out with a report assessing food security across the country. We'll get the latest in a month, but it will be the last. The USDA is terminating the annual report, saying it was “politicized.” Researchers, however, say it was vital. Also on the show: no sure thing on the future of interest rates and the costs for Chinese adoptees to search for their birth family.</p>

(date: 2025-09-24)
      <p>
      <p>After being pulled by ABC, Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned to TV last night. Thing is, station groups Nexstar and Sinclair — which control ABC affiliates that reach about 20% of the country — opted out. Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners. And later: If Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill can’t reach a deal, many federal agencies will close a week from today.</p>

      <h1>Rate cut? So what?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>Newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran has argued the federal funds rate should be a full two percentage points lower than its current level. A major cut like that could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs, spurring spending. But longer-term, inflation would likely balloon. After that: Auto dealers face new obstacles as EV tax credits end, a traveling nurse navigates frequent moves, and U.S. economic growth is “more resilient than expected,&quot; according to an OECD report.</p>

      <p>The newest member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors — close ally of President Donald Trump, Stephen Miran — made his case for more (and larger) interest rate cuts in a speech yesterday at the Economic Club of New York. He argued that the president's policies will push prices down, so the Fed doesn’t have to worry that lowering interest rates will spark inflation. Plus, entrepreneurship could suffer following the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There’s a race going on among tech firms — big and small — to join in the construction of what President Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome, a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Tens of billions of dollars in military contracts are at stake. In fact, the total cost might be in the trillions and the project could stretch a decade.</p>
<p>The technology and scale needed to make this all happen is, so far, largely unproven. And a whole host of tech firms are trying to show that they can help with the very complex undertaking. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sheera Frenkel, reporter at the New York Times, about some of the tech that would make this whole system work.</p>

The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>

      <p>If you have, you're not alone. American consumers lost more than $1 billion to fraud on social media in the first six months of this year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. That’s almost ten times what it was five years ago. Today, we'll hear how consumers can protect themselves. But first, we know what the Federal Reserve did with short-term interest rates this week.

      <p>During the 2024 election, the cryptocurrency industry, including political action committees, accounted for nearly half of all of the corporate money going into the election, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen.

      <p>The top 10% of earners in the U.S. accounted for nearly 50% of spending in the second quarter — the highest share since Moody's Analytics began collecting the data in 1989. That's important context, as consumer spending keeps climbing despite tariffs and a grim labor market. In this episode, what it all says about our economy. Plus: Homeowners rush to refinance as rates fall, hydropower escapes GOP cuts to clean energy, and Etsy sellers struggle as tariffs raise costs.</p>

      <p>Wyoming made billions from coal mining over the last 50 years, funding the government, schools, roads, parks. But President Trump’s major spending bill, passed in July, gives mining companies a break on royalty fees — leaving state budgets lean. In this episode, easing coal fees comes at a price. Plus: Non-store retail spending saw double-digit year-over-year growth, small businesses suffer as they wait for tariff clarity, and stock investors basically ignore all the bad economic headlines.</p>

But President Trump wants to see fewer of those reports. In a social media post on Monday, he said companies should report just twice a year instead of quarterly.

      <p>On Monday, President Trump said public companies should no longer report quarterly earnings. Instead, he suggested corporations report just twice a year. Trump isn't the first to suggest a pared-down reporting schedule, but the idea raises questions about the balance between corporate transparency and long-term growth. Also on the show, the South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human rights violations during a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where 300 South Korean workers were detained and deported. So what does this episode tell us about the U.S. immigration system? Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation of American Policy, joins us to discuss.</p>

      <p>Borders may be invisible to most shoppers, but for businesses, they often mean delays, extra costs, and reams of paperwork. And amid Trump’s trade war, global trade is now faster and more complex than ever. Those new pressures have sparked a boom in new &quot;customs tech&quot; companies promising to speed things up. The BBC’s Leanna Byrne reports.</p>

      <p>The Russell 2000, a stock index of smaller companies or “small caps,” has fallen behind the S&amp;P 500 over the past few years. A Fed rate cut, which may come as soon as next week, could change their luck. In this episode, why interest rates have an outsize effect on smaller companies. Plus: Homebuilding is harder under President Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies, brands lean into the power of scent, and we recap the week’s economic headlines.</p>

Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration.

Are restaurants hiring when no one else is? And, should retirement accounts have access to private equity funds?</p>
