      <h1>Small firms cross their fingers for a rate cut</h1>

(date: 2025-09-12)
      <p>
      <p>The Russell 2000, a stock index of smaller companies or “small caps,” has fallen behind the S&amp;P 500 over the past few years. A Fed rate cut, which may come as soon as next week, could change their luck. In this episode, why interest rates have an outsize effect on smaller companies. Plus: Homebuilding is harder under President Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies, brands lean into the power of scent, and we recap the week’s economic headlines.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>"When you face bad economic numbers, you've got two choices: fix the economy or attack the numbers," says University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration. But first, grocery prices jumped in August. Thing is, tariffs aren't to blame.</p>

      <p>The labor market has been cooling for a bit, and in some sectors is virtually frozen. That could push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. But the Fed’s other mandate, besides maximum employment, is price stability. And inflation is picking up. What to do, what to do…. Later in this episode: Why are utilities costs up?

      <p>A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction barring President Donald Trump from ousting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, which means she can stay in her job while she fights her dismissal. The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services. Why is that not the case with electricity providers?</p>

(date: 2025-09-09)

      <p>Budget cuts may be in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' future. But the data collected by the BLS is critical for federal decision making. In this episode, we calculate if the $700 million investment is worthwhile. Plus: Firms that spend the most on AI slash tons of jobs, economic uncertainty drives up the price of gold, and mortgage rates fall — which is good for buyers but a bad sign for the overall economy.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>China's exports to the U.S. are down a third year over year. That’s a significant drop, reflective of President Trump’s punishing tariff agenda. Although China’s overall export growth has slowed, it still rose 4.5% in August — thanks, in part, to strategic redirection to new markets.

      <p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has gotten a lot of attention lately — President Trump is attempting to remove one member and has nominated another. But there’s more under the central bank umbrella than president-appointed officials. In this episode, we break down why regional Fed banks and Fed presidents matter. Plus: The latest Beige book shows an uptick in lending, shipping costs are down and an economist walks us through her process for reading a CPI report.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Economic data rolling out this week has helped paint a snapshot of the economy. We found out yesterday that 5.3 million people were hired and 5.3 million quit or were laid off in July. Fresh data out this morning revealed that the private sector added only 54,000 jobs last month. Today, we'll discuss this slowing job growth. Plus, an illegal sports streaming site is shut down, and Texas is restricting the ability of certain foreign nationals to own property.</p>

      <p>There's a black market trade for everything — including ants. (Yes, even ants.) And President Donald Trump has slashed the number of federal government employees, which included entomologists focused on pest control. Today, we'll look at what the illicit ant trade looks like and the sort of environmental and financial costs that can result from invasive species. But first, Trump has his first chance at reshaping the Federal Reserve through the nomination of Stephen Miran.</p>

      <p>The big budget bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in July allowed tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to expire. That means health insurance costs will increase significantly for millions, disproportionately hitting small business owners and self-employed people. We’ll learn about the impacts. Also this morning: Retailers have already shifted focus from back-to-school shopping to holiday sales. Thing is, the outlook doesn't look too rosy this year.</p>

Unfortunately, while statistics reported by the private sector have a place in our economic understanding, they're not necessarily comprehensive, transparent, or free.

      <p>Core inflation rose to 2.9% in July, according to the latest PCE data <em>— </em>the Fed's preferred inflation gauge <em>— </em>marking its highest level in months. But despite stubborn inflation and falling consumer confidence, consumer spending continues to climb. Courtenay Brown at Axios and Jordyn Holman at The New York Times join "Marketplace" host Amy Scott to talk about the latest inflation numbers, and the court battle brewing between the White House and the Federal Reserve. Also in this episode: the economics of uncertainty, why job-hopping may no longer lead to bigger paychecks, and how "buy now, pay later" is being rebranded to target women.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>We're continuing to follow President Donald Trump's campaign against U.S. central bank independence. His move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud has now been challenged by a lawsuit from Cook. Fed independence has been a strength of the U.S. financial system, but what happens if that disappears? We turn to Hungary as a case study.

      <h1>Chili's is back (baby back, baby back)</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22)
      <p>
      <p>Brinker International, which owns casual dining chain Chili’s, just beat 50-year sales and revenue records. In this fickle economic moment, how’d they do it? The answer involves viral fried mozzarella and the power of young consumers. Also in this episode: Jay Powell hints at rate cuts, AI data centers increase electricity costs for everyone, and automakers swear updated tech, not tariffs, drove up prices.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <h1>A turnaround for manufacturing — can it last?</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22)
      <p>
      <p>We learned yesterday that business activity in the U.S. picked up in August, led by a big advance in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing had been in a slump, but recorded its strongest growth in orders in 18 months. Is it the start of a bigger trend or just a blip? Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <h1>What's in a framework?</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22)
      <p>
      <p>The fashion world has the Met Gala. The movies have the Oscars. Central banking has an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech, where economists will be listening for clues on interest rates. But there’s another pressing issue looming over Powell’s speech: a new five-year framework for the Fed's interest rate strategy. We have an explainer. Plus, there's new evidence that first-time homebuyers remain undeterred.</p>

      <h1>Trump tones down tariffs on European imports</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A trade agreement between the United States and the European Union means that U.S. tariffs on imported European goods will be significantly lower than previously thought. The U.S. will cap tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors at 15%. That's a huge decrease from prior threats of levies as high as 250%. Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>
