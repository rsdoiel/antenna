stay or go?</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
On today’s episode, Kai and Kimberly discuss the future of Biden-era
clean energy tax credits under Trump 2.0. A group of GOP lawmakers want
them to stay. Meanwhile, the administration is rescinding memos that
pushed for climate change-resilient infrastructure. Plus, the hosts
weigh in on the arrest of a Palestinian activist and Columbia University
student by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Is this the first
arrest of “many to come?” Finally, we’ll smile as the cherry blossoms in
Washington, D.C., get closer to full bloom.
