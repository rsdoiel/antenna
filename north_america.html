      <h1>It's quality over low cost for U.S. clothing manufacturing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/19/its-quality-over-low-cost-for-us-clothing-manufacturing">Marketplace Morning Report</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Many garment factories have shuttered amid a decades-long decline in U.S. apparel production, and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back. But higher-end, higher-quality clothing can still be made at a profit stateside. Today, we'll take lessons from one suit factory in New Bedford, Massachusetts. But first: Home Depot reported disappointing profits this morning, and more retailers are having to weigh price costs, dwindling warehouse inventories, and price-conscious consumers.</p>

      <h1>Outsourced jobs threatened by AI</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/08/19/outsourced-jobs-threatened-by-ai">Marketplace Morning Report</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Experts are still in the early stages of understanding just how much generative AI will disrupt the labor force. A new report by MIT finds that the adoption of AI led some firms to cut back spending on jobs that were often already being outsourced — things like customer support, software engineering, and administrative tasks. We'll learn more. Also: the dollar's role as the world's "reserve currency" and a $2 billion lifeline for Intel.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan’s SoftBank has invested $2 billion in U.S. chipmaker Intel, which has been losing ground lately in the booming AI market. It also comes as the U.S. government weighs whether to take a direct stake in the company. And, as historic White House talks spark hopes of a Putin–Zelensky summit, the war in Ukraine grinds on, with Russia turning to North Korea to plug major labor gaps.</p>

      <p>New context for the strong-consumer-spending-and-falling-consumer-sentiment combo: According to a Boston Fed report, the proportion of spending done by top-earning U.S. households is growing, and the share spent by lower-income Americans is shrinking. What might that widening gap tells us about the trajectory of this economy? Plus: Strong Q2 corporate earnings are an economic bright spot, U.S. energy exports may not break records again this year, and we investigate who profits from the tripled ICE budget.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      Electricity prices are rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation.  That's especially costly during the dog days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.  In addition to hot weather, a variety of factors are causing power bills to climb, including the high cost of natural gas used to generate electricity and soaring demand from data centers.

      For most Americans, we just lived through the highest period of inflation in our lives. And we are reminded of this every time we go grocery shopping. All over TikTok, tons of people have posted videos of how little they got for… $20. $40. $100. Most upsetting to us: an $8 box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br><br>Food prices are almost 30% higher than they were five years ago. It’s bad. And those new, higher prices aren’t going away.<br><br>At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down. And yet, our fears or feelings that things will spiral out of control again? Those have not slowed down.<br><br>This mismatch has been giving us all the... feelings. Inflation feelings. Infeelings. <br><br>On our latest show: we sort through our infeeltions. We talk to the economists who have studied us.

      <p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the July CPI report showed consumer prices remained steady, despite tariff noise. Today’s producer price index tells a different story: Wholesale prices grew a whopping 3.3% year-over-year. When might retailers pass those higher costs on to consumers? We break it down. Plus: Automated applications sow pessimism among job hunters, New York City marks two months of a ban on tenant-paid broker fees, and U.S. oil refineries face regionally different outlooks.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this month, claiming that the monthly jobs numbers — which were revised downward — were “rigged” to make him look bad. Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare? Also: a flare of inflation at the wholesale level and a comeback for adjustable-rate mortgages.</p>

      <p>In addition to the many considerations surrounding cost, those who lost homes in this year's California wildfires may also be looking for an environmentally-friendly way to rebuild that's able to withstand the next fire. Today, Marketplace's David Brancaccio explores mass timber, which doesn't burn easily, as an option for home reconstruction. But first, New York’s attorney general is suing the company that runs Zelle, alleging its customers were left open to fraud.</p>

      <h1>"Hacks" creators on collaboration, S5, and the state of comedy</h1>

      <p>
      <p>HBO Max’s “Hacks” often tackles the push and pull between art and profit in the entertainment industry. It’s a topic the show’s creators are deeply familiar with. In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal discusses that tension — as it appears in the show and in real life — with “Hacks” showrunners Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky. Plus: Job-finding sites struggle as hiring slows, and response rates to government surveys fall.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. In Argentina, the government manipulated the inflation rate. Economists went rogue to calculate the real rate, and people lost trust in the numbers.

      <p>Since President Trump’s firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over a weak jobs report, we’ve been thinking a lot about the trustworthiness of U.S. economic data. Other countries like China can offer a glimpse of what happens when that trust erodes.

      <p>
      <p>Recently, President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after revisions depicted a weaker job market than initially thought. This week, Trump called on the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get rid of his chief economist, after the economist predicted that tariffs would force consumers to pay extra. What should consumers and investors make of this? We'll discuss. And later, we'll hear how French factories are benefiting from increased defense spending.</p>

      <p>Social Security turns 90 tomorrow. Some 74 million Americans receive the benefits, and a new survey shows that 65% of retirees rely on them. Roughly 40% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and this precarity comes at a time when Social Security faces the possibility of benefit cuts. Plus, Trump's tariffs are generating billions in revenue monthly, and Brazil's president announced $5 billion to help smaller companies deal with tariffs.</p>

      <p>Ever read past the top line of the consumer price index? That 2.7% inflation rate varies a lot by metro area. The same goes for goods categories. So why is inflation higher in San Diego than Dallas? And higher for baby clothes and than electronics? We explain. Also in this episode: Long-term unemployment rises as hiring slows, businesses grow weary of waiting for tariff clarity, and we talk to Cheryl McKissack Daniel, CEO of the country's largest Black-owned construction firm.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Philadelphia, Boston, and Seattle have all experienced strikes by trash collection workers this summer. At their peak, more than 2,000 workers coast to coast walked off the job after contract talks stalled. The Teamsters Union representing the workers says members deserve a pay rise and better health care benefits. We'll hear from the picket line and customers affected. But first, a Texas-based manufacturer reflects on what all this tariff back-and-forth means for business.</p>

      <p>Each year, pediatricians order vaccines in anticipation of the winter respiratory virus season. But plummeting demand and confusion over vaccine recommendations have thrown the process into chaos, forcing some doctors to gamble and order vaccines they may not be able to use. We'll hear more. But first, the White House has again extended its trade truce with China, and the president's tariffs hit toy stores, which buy most of their products overseas.</p>

      <h1>U.S. and China extend trade truce</h1>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It came right down to the wire, but the U.S. and China have extended their trade truce until November. This means those massive American tariff hikes — some as high as 145% — have been put on hold, as Beijing was ready to hit back with 125% tariffs.
