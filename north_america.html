      <h1>About that $100,000 H-1B visa fee</h1>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration is working to tamp down alarm over a new, $100,000 visa fee it announced on Friday. Technology, finance, and other major companies that depend on employees holding H-1B visas had initially thought the fee would be applied to existing visa holders, and those with H-1B workers who were temporarily abroad panicked. The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Stocks are on a winning streak. The Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on Friday. Now, everything that goes up can go down, but there are some reasons to think the bulls may stick around for a while. We'll hear more. And later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is pushing for stricter regulations on drug advertising. What could change?</p>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>Here’s cautionary tale for you, out of China, about a young woman who says she fell in love with an artificial intelligence chatbot. There have been well-publicized instances of people seeking companionship from chatbots and it leading to tragedy. In this instance, it caused heartbreak. The story involves the Chinese AI firm Deepseek which, earlier this year, launched a chatbot that's almost as good as its American rivals. Soon after the launch, a young woman began a conversation with that chatbot. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak takes the story from there.</p>

A major culprit behind the price increases? Climate change. Also on the show: Nvidia is buying a $5 billion stake in Intel, and we look at what the end of “de minimis" tax exemption means for air cargo companies.</p>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
      <p>There's a long list of actions the Trump administration has taken in this economy: calling for the removal of Intel's CEO, then purchasing a nearly 10% stake in that company; special exemptions to tariffs; calls on Walmart not to raise prices; and even telling Coca-Cola to use cane sugar and Cracker Barrel to keep its old logo. What can we make of all this? And what should we call it? Plus, economic predictions by Fed members are all over the map.</p>

Plus: A sociologist expresses concern about AI’s long-term effects on the American labor market, import prices reflect an uptick in “undervaluation,” and President Trump wants reduce earnings report requirements for public firms.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>
      <p>Federal Reserve watchers feel pretty sure the Federal Open Market Committee will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent this week. The real question? Whether Jay Powell and co. have more rate cuts planned, or if they’re taking it meeting by meeting.

(date: 2025-09-15)
      <p>
      <p>The import price index, which keeps track of the price of imports before tariffs are applied, comes out tomorrow. You can tell by looking at it who exactly is paying for tariffs. Prices in certain categories have fallen in recent months — a sign that some foreign exporters are trying to offset the cost of tariffs. But first: The U.S. and China are talking trade, and consumers continue to spend despite economic anxieties.</p>

      <p>The Census Bureau finds that the gap between what women and men earned in 2024 widened. Typical wages for men increased 3.7%, but stayed flat for women. Also on this morning's program: An internal watchdog at the Labor Department has launched a probe into how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects and reports economic data. Plus, new data found that foreclosure activity is up 18%. How worried should we be?</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Pharmaceutical giant Merck has scrapped plans worth more than $1 billion to expand its operations in the United Kingdom, blaming a lack of government support. It's the latest pharmaceutical company to curb investments there. Also, Mexico plans to slap tariffs of up to 50% on cars from China and other Asian countries.

      <p>A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction barring President Donald Trump from ousting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, which means she can stay in her job while she fights her dismissal. The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services. Why is that not the case with electricity providers?</p>

But first: an update on reports that hundreds of South Korean workers detained in a Georgia immigration raid last week will be flown home.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Markets in Japan have reacted positively to the departure of the country's leader, Shigeru Ishiba, following recent election losses and despite a recent U.S. trade deal. Then, French Prime Minister François Bayrou looks set to lose a confidence vote over drastic budget cuts as the country faces mounting debt. And the United Kingdom is trying to tackle the high price of prisoner reoffending; in England and Wales, nearly a third of prison leavers end up back inside, costing the U.K. government around $24 billion annually.</p>

Also in this episode: The number of American homeowners fell for the first time in a decade, economists explain how the U.S. became the economic data gold standard, and revenue from website ads grow more popular among retailers.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>Hey Smarties! Today we’re sharing an episode from the latest season of “How We Survive,” Marketplace’s climate solutions podcast. Host Amy Scott and the team have been digging into the rise and fall of environmental, social and governance-based investing, or ESG. <strong><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/04/23/the-evolution-of-esg-investing" class="default">In this episode,</a></strong> ESG comes back to life in new forms of climate-conscious investing.</p>

      <h1>Expiring tax credits will increase health insurance costs for millions</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03)
      <p>
      <p>The big budget bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in July allowed tax credits under the Affordable Care Act to expire. That means health insurance costs will increase significantly for millions, disproportionately hitting small business owners and self-employed people. We’ll learn about the impacts. Also this morning: Retailers have already shifted focus from back-to-school shopping to holiday sales. Thing is, the outlook doesn't look too rosy this year.</p>

      <p>We're talking about companies here, obviously. A decade after Kraft Heinz became one of the world’s biggest food companies, it’s reversing course and is splitting into two. It’s not the only corporation to go this route recently: There’s Warner Bros Discovery, which is separating into two media companies, and Honeywell, which is separating into three. What's behind all this restructuring? Also on the show: renewed interest in IPOs and promised safety improvements from OpenAI.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A cyberattack has caused major production problems at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover. Both of its main factories in the U.K. have been affected, and it comes at a peak sales period. Plus, long-term government borrowing costs continue to climb globally. Then, police in Singapore have ordered Facebook's parent company, Meta, to take measures to prevent scammers from impersonating government officials. And, a greenhouse gas emissions tax in Denmark will result in big changes to the Danish landscape.</p>

(date: 2025-09-03)
      <p>
      <p>Big Tech companies have been in an all-out bidding war to capture top AI researchers and engineers. Companies like Meta have reportedly been offering compensation packages in the hundreds of millions of dollars. They're the kind of eye-watering sums you usually only hear about in pro sports. Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino explores whether this strategy of collecting expensive superstars will pay off for Big Tech firms looking to win the AI race. </p>

      <p>“Commercial paper” is a type of short-term debt that’s paid off much faster than a typical corporate bond. It’s kinda like an afternoon snack — perhaps not great for you, but it’ll hold you over until dinner. In this episode, what it means that commercial paper bonds have been ramping up all year. Plus: Iconic millennial-focused brands pivot to Gen Z consumers, the BLS cares if you’ve got free time, and the Trump White House closely monitors U.S. chip manufacturing progress.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

The decision is on hold until mid-October, giving the White House time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This morning, we'll parse which tariffs are affected and which aren't. Plus, a lack of trade deals is weighing on American farmers, and caps on federal student loan borrowing will go into effect next year.</p>

      <p>More and more people are using generative AI to “resurrect” deceased loved ones. There are tools that can turn an old photograph into a short animation or create entire "AI clones" trained on old audio, video or written diaries. These technological advancements are taking memorializing the dead to a whole new level, but is it healthy? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke to psychologist Elaine Kasket, who specializes in mental health issues and technology, for some answers. </p>

      <p>As the Trump administration strips away federal data collection agencies' funding and pressures statisticians to produce positive reports, we might wonder whether private data can fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, while statistics reported by the private sector have a place in our economic understanding, they're not necessarily comprehensive, transparent, or free. Also in this episode: EVs see record sales ahead of tax credit end date, Chinese AI firms meet at a conference in Shanghai, and regional Feds give tariff uncertainty updates.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.
