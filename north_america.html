deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals
accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of
Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump
administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104
deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the
number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly
manner.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a
contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the
return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality
is verified.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would “do what’s right”
in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone
conversation with Modi.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a
media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in
a process to deter illegal migration and “cooperation between India and
the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in
times to come.”</p>
<p>Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting
that could take place next week between Trump and Modi.</p>
<p>“India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being
deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants
illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal
migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted
by the Trump administration,” according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished
Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for
students.</p>
<p>“Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration,
while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the
U.S.,” Jaiswal has said.</p>
<p>The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully
has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest
number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries,
according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.</p>
<p>Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for
only about 3 percent of illegal crossings.</p>
<p>The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian
migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last
week.</p>
<p>Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and
September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but
Wednesday’s flight was the first time that they were sent back via
military aircraft.</p>
<p>The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which
is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India
to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the
western state of Gujarat.</p>
<p>Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI
(Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in
the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring
skills and education to access global opportunities through legal
channels.</p>

Postal Service to accept inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong after
suspension</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said on Wednesday
it would accept parcels from China and Hong Kong, in a U-turn after a
suspension following President Donald Trump ending a trade provision
used by retailers including Temu, Shein, and Amazon AMZN.O to ship
low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. </p>
<p>“The USPS and Customs and Border Protection are working closely
together to implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new
China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery,” it
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese
goods and closed the “de minimis” exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to
avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800 from China. </p>
<p>USPS did not immediately comment on whether its temporary suspension
had been tied to Trump’s order ending de minimis shipments from China,
which was announced on Saturday and came into force from one minute past
midnight on Tuesday. </p>
<p>“There has really been absolutely zero time for anyone to prepare for
this,” said Maureen Cori, co-founder at New York-based consultancy
Supply Chain Compliance. “What we really need is direction from the
government on how to handle this without warning or notice.” </p>
<p>Currently, de minimis parcels are consolidated so that customs can
clear hundreds or thousands of shipments at once, but they will now
require individual clearances, significantly increasing the burden for
postal services, brokers and customs agents, said Cori.</p>

id="decorated-pilot-harry-stewart-jr.-one-of-the-last-surviving-tuskegee-airmen-dies-at-100">Decorated
pilot Harry Stewart, Jr., one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen,
dies at 100</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who
broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his
combat heroism, has died. He was 100.</p>
<p>Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed
332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the
nation’s first Black military pilots.</p>
<p>The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death.
The organization said he died peacefully at his home in Bloomfield
Hills, Michigan, on Sunday.</p>
<p>Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three
German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of
a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying
competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be
recognized until decades later.</p>
<p>“Harry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and
accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long
after fighting for our country in World War II,” Brian Smith, president
and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said.</p>
<p>Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when
he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he
would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his
life titled “Soaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen’s Firsthand Account of
World War II.” In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart
joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military
pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for
where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips
of their P-51 Mustangs.</p>
<p>“I did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I
just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up
to my duty,” Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN
about the war.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and
prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he
was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about
his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort
U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing
significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups.</p>
<p>“I got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the
scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the
hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the
condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling
of belonging to something that was really big,” Stewart said in a 2020
interview with WAMC.</p>
<p>Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too
busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his
book.</p>
<p>Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left
the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a
mechanical engineering degree at New York University. He relocated to
Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline
company.</p>
<p>Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears
on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the
aircraft.</p>
<p>“When I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there
were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the
pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to
my eyes is that they were both female,” Stewart said.</p>
<p>The Air Force last month briefly removed training courses with videos
of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or
WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown
on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were
quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the U.S. to take ownership
of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Gazans to
relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Trump made the stunning
announcement Tuesday evening, as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. White House Bureau Chief Patsy
Widakuswara has this report.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-us-will-take-ownership-of-gaza">Trump says US will
take ownership of Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the United
States to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements
of forcing Palestinians in the war-torn enclave to relocate to
neighboring Jordan and Egypt.</p>
<p>“The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with
it, too,” he said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>In recent days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the southern
parts of Gaza have marched north toward their homes after Israel allowed
people to return as part of the ceasefire for a hostage release deal
with Hamas.</p>
<p>Trump said he wants to develop the area into what he calls “the
Riviera of the Middle East.”</p>
<p>“Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning
that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with
something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,” he
said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said one of his war goals is to ensure that Hamas never
poses a threat to Israel again. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is “taking it
to a much higher level.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s
worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump did not share details on how he plans to exert control over the
area ravaged by 15 months of war, but he did not rule out sending U.S.
troops.</p>
<p>“If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that
piece, and we’re going to develop it,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments mark a remarkable shift from his criticism of
America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. He sees a “long-term
ownership position,” for the U.S. that would bring “great stability to
that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.”</p>
<p>“This was not a decision made lightly,” he said.</p>
<p>However, any discussion of relocation will certainly be met with
resistance from Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands were driven from
their homes in what is now called Israel: in the 1948 war surrounding
Israel’s creation and during Israel’s 1967 seizure of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>There are currently 2.1 million people in Gaza, according to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority said Wednesday that Trump’s proposal would
be “a serious violation of international law.”</p>
<p>Egypt’s Foreign Ministry also expressed opposition, highlighting the
need to carry out post-war reconstruction “without moving the
Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.”</p>
<p>China, Australia, Turkey and France all backed the need to pursue a
two-state solution for peace in the region.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how occupying Gaza would fit into Trump’s own stated
goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include Riyadh. He brokered the
deal that normalized ties between Israel and Arab countries in 2020.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia quickly reacted to Trump’s Gaza comments by saying it
will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without the creation
of a Palestinian state, and that its position is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p>“The kingdom of Saudi Arabia also stresses what it had previously
announced regarding its absolute rejection of infringement on the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, whether through Israeli
settlement policies, annexation of Palestinian lands or efforts to
displace the Palestinian people from their land,” the Saudi Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trump’s statement on Gaza is his latest signaling of expansionist
ambitions, following his statements to acquire Greenland from Denmark,
taking over the Panama Canal, and absorbing Canada.</p>
<p>Ceasefire renegotiation</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the White House earlier Tuesday, U.S. Middle
East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has begun negotiations
toward Phase 2 of the three-phase ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal,
which includes the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a
permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the
territory.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so
far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>Witkoff suggested that the administration is considering
renegotiating parts of the agreement that took effect on Jan. 19, the
day before Trump was inaugurated.</p>
<p>“Part of the problem is that it wasn’t such a wonderful agreement
that was first signed. That was not dictated by the Trump
administration. We had nothing to do with it,” he said. “Now we’re
working within that rubric, and we’re figuring things out.”</p>
<p>He doubled down on Trump’s suggestion to remove Gazans, saying that
the five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza as outlined in phase three is
“physically impossible.”</p>
<p>Trump’s insistence on relocating Gazans could signal a desire to
renegotiate the ceasefire deal, particularly the second phase, said
Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p>
<p>“The goal might be to force Hamas into choosing between relinquishing
control of Gaza or leaving the Strip if it wants an Israeli withdrawal
or reconstruction, or risk the entirety of the population facing
forcible removal, though how that would be carried out is unknown,” he
told VOA.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Trump ended support for the UN agency that helps
Palestinian refugees and withdrew the U.S. from what he calls the
antisemitic UN Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>Iran nuclear</p>
<p>Shortly before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump directed his aides
to restore his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran to prevent it from
getting a nuclear weapon and to drive down its oil exports to zero.</p>
<p>“I’m unhappy to do it, but I really have not so much choice, because
we have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it’s not going to have to
be used in any great measure at all,” he said. “It’s very simple. Iran
cannot have a nuclear weapon.”</p>
<p>As of September 2024, U.S. intelligence concluded in a report that
Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. However, Iran has “undertaken
activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,”
the report said.</p>
<p>In November, the Justice Department under the Biden administration
announced that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential
election had been thwarted. Trump said he has directed his aides to
“obliterate” Tehran if the Iranian regime moves to assassinate him.</p>
<p>“If they did that they would be obliterated,” Trump said. “I’ve left
instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be
anything left.”</p>
<p>Pressure on Netanyahu</p>
<p>Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu comes as the Israeli leader faces
pressure from his right-wing coalition to end the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Both Trump and Netanyahu share the goal of ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza
and return the remaining Israeli hostages, said Jonathan Rynhold, head
of the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. However,
the two men place different priorities on different aspects of the
goal.</p>
<p>For Netanyahu, the priority is to ensure Hamas has no political
future, Rynhold told VOA, while for Trump it’s to maintain the ceasefire
“so that he can move to an Israeli-Saudi Arabian normalization
agreement.”</p>
<p>U.S. administrations under Presidents George W. Bush to Joe Biden
have stated their support for Palestinian statehood under the two-state
solution. In 2020 during his first term, Trump announced his Middle East
peace plan that would deny Palestinians having their own state.</p>
<p>Trump was non-committal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the
two-state solution. His plan on Gaza “doesn’t mean anything about a
two-state or one-state or any other state,” he said.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed
1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s
counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than
half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll
includes 17,000 Hamas militants.</p>

<h2 id="senate-confirms-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general">Senate
confirms Pam Bondi as US attorney general</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general
on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John
Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass
her confirmation 54-46.</p>
<p>Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is
expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been
the target of Trump’s ire over the criminal cases it brought against
him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over
the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the
president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his
perceived adversaries.</p>
<p>Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they
contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe
unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two
indictments.</p>
<p>“Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core
mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to
their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John
Thune, R-S.D.</p>
<p>But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with
the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to
pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused
himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into potential ties
between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play
no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation
hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump’s
adversaries. And she has repeated Trump’s claims that the prosecutions
against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice
Department “had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s
got to stop.”</p>
<p>Bondi’s confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the
Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved
in the January 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to
mass firings.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting
FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI
employees who worked on the January 6 cases — which Trump has described
as a “grave national injustice.” Bove, who defended Trump in his
criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice
Department officials would carry out a “review process to determine
whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.”</p>
<p>Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI
executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who
investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the District
of Columbia’s U.S. attorney’s office who were hired to help with the
massive Jan. 6 investigation.</p>
<p>Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would
not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not
the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed
Trump’s campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.</p>

<h2 id="high-threat-undocumented-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo">‘High
threat’ undocumented migrants sent to Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — A small number of migrants were transferred from Texas to
a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday via U.S.
military aircraft, U.S. defense officials told VOA.</p>
<p>Fewer than 20 migrants, which the administration has deemed to be
“high threat,” are being transported on the first C-17 flight from Fort
Bliss, one defense official said, speaking to VOA on background, a
method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, before the
flight landed in Cuba.</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos
on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military
cargo plane, calling them “the worst of the worst,” and warning the
effort to deport them is just getting started.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on
the military flight from Texas to Guantanamo Bay were members of Tren de
Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did
not say when or how they were first taken into custody.</p>
<p>The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a
Foreign Terrorist Organization.</p>
<p>Since President Donald Trump’s executive order last month, the
Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities
to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to
media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a
fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are
not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News.</p>
<p>“The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as
additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the
requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead
federal agency,” U.S. Southern Command, which overseas operations in
South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a
statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention
facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The
facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror
suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks
and members of the Taliban.</p>
<p>“If you’re a violent gang banger, and you’ve been taken out of our
country, and we’re waiting to bring you to your country, we’re going to
put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,” Secretary of Defense Pete
Hegseth told Fox News this week.</p>
<p>In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments
of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold
up to 30,000 migrants.</p>
<p>“Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold
them because we don’t want them coming back. So, we’re going to send
them out to Guantanamo,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Closing Guantanamo</p>
<p>Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had
sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W.
Bush administration in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan
that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001.</p>
<p>Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a
statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human
rights catastrophe.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants
to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more
injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,” Hendrickson
said.</p>
<p>At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility
held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees
at the facility, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility
was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early
1990s.</p>

id="analysts-american-iron-dome-reduces-nuclear-coercion-but-drives-arms-race">Analysts:
American Iron Dome reduces nuclear coercion but drives arms race</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build an American
version of the Iron Dome to shield the U.S. from aerial attacks will
deter China and Russia from coercing the U.S. using nuclear weapons but
could drive a three-way arms race, said analysts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. government’s Missile Defense Agency on Friday asked the
defense industry to identify technologies and capabilities available to
construct the Iron Dome for America. The deadline is the end of
February.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It made the request in response to Trump’s executive order signed on
Jan. 27, setting forth a motion to build an American Iron Dome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The United States will provide for the common defense of its
citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation
missile defense shield,” the executive order stated.</p>
<p>The American Iron Dome will defend the U.S. “against ballistic,
hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial
attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries,” according to the
statement.</p>
<p>It will ensure the U.S. has “its second-strike capability,” meaning
it would be able to launch nuclear retaliation.</p>
<p>The Iron Dome would also include a review of missile defense posture
to identify ways for U.S. allies and partners to increase cooperation on
missile defense development and operations.</p>
<p>Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to draw up a plan in the
next three months to build the missile shield.</p>
<p>Strengthening deterrence</p>
<p>Robert Peters, research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile
Defense at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday via phone, the Iron
Dome for America “will take away the option for nuclear coercion that an
actor could try to hold over the U.S.” in addition to defending the U.S.
from an actual strike.</p>
<p>“It is feasible for us to build an Iron Dome,” he said, “and there is
no reason why we should not do so, particularly given that we are seeing
the autocrats in North Korea, China, and Russia engaging in nuclear
coercion.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use nuclear
weapons multiple times during an ongoing war in Ukraine that began with
its invasion in 2022.</p>
<p>In November, Putin revised the Russian threshold for using nuclear
weapons in a doctrine issued after former U.S. President Joe Biden
allowed Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-made
longer-range missiles.</p>
<p>The doctrine announced that Russia has the right to use nuclear
weapons to respond to a conventional weapons attack. Previously, Russia
reserved the right to use nuclear weapons only when an attack threatened
its existence.</p>
<p>Patrycja Bazylczyk, a research associate for the Missile Defense
Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “If
implemented well, an ‘iron dome for America’ could bolster American
defense and affect the strategic calculus of our adversaries.”</p>
<p>She told VOA on Monday, “Improving homeland air and missile defenses
reduces the confidence of a potential attacker, thereby raising the
threshold for attack and contributing to deterrence.”</p>
<p>The Iron Dome plan resembles former President Ronald Reagon’s
proposed dual objective of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and
nuclear disarmament, said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear
Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).</p>
<p>The SDI, also came to be called Star Wars, was announced in 1983 to
develop a space-based defense system to protect the U.S. from nuclear
missiles.</p>
<p>Risk of arms race</p>
<p>Trump’s “Iron Dome initiative, to some extent, echoes his concern
about nuclear weapons,” but “a stronger U.S. missile defense system
would almost certainly make it more difficult to reach a nuclear
agreement with Russia and China because of their concern that more
effective missile defenses would increase the threat to their nuclear
retaliatory capability,” continued Kristensen.  </p>
<p>Trump said in a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, on Jan. 23 that he wants to discuss “denuclearization” with
Russia, and that China would need to come along.</p>
<p>Kristensen told VOA on Thursday that “FAS applauds Trump’s remarks
about the need for nuclear limits and eventually denuclearization and
urge the administration to pursue these goals.”</p>
<p>He added, “Nuclear deterrence can be maintained with far fewer
nuclear weapons” and having nuclear reduction talks is “urgent because
the New START treaty expires in about one year.”</p>
<p>The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a nuclear arms
reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in
February 2026.</p>
<p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of Arms Control Association, told
VOA on Friday Trump envisions “more ambitious system to thwart strategic
missile attacks by Russia or China” than his efforts in 2019.</p>
<p>“It is not realistic to believe that an effective system would be
feasible anytime soon, if ever, mainly because adversaries will respond
by seeking to overwhelm missile defense systems in order to maintain
their own capacity to deter U.S. conventional or nuclear attack,” he
said.</p>
<p>Kimball added, however, “We welcome Trump’s interest in negotiating
agreements with Russia and China to reduce the ‘tremendous’ costs of
nuclear weapons by reducing or ‘denuclearizing’ with Russia and China.
Without such a deal, we could see a costly three-way offensive nuclear
arms races that no one can win.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 5,044 nuclear warheads while Russia has over,
5,500 and China has approximately 500 nuclear warheads, according to the
FAS.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon in its annual report released in December on China’s
military estimates that China will have more than 1,000 operational
nuclear warheads by 2030.</p>
<p>North Korea, through its state-run KCNA, on Monday expressed
opposition to the U.S. plan to build the Iron Dome, describing it as a
“hegemonic attempt to maintain its military supremacy.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA on Monday that it does not
have any comments on the issue at this time.</p>
<p>A top Russia diplomat quoted by the state news agency Tass on
Thursday said America’s Iron Dome “puts an end to the prospects of
strategic offensive arms reduction on nuclear and missile arsenals in
favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.”</p>
<p>Richard Weitz, director for the Center for Political-Military
Analysis at Hudson Institute, said, “The Russians and Chinese have
always said that if the U.S. builds better defenses, they’re going to
build better offenses so they can overcome these defenses.”</p>
<p>He told VOA on Thursday, the Iron Dome effort, along with Trump’s
interest in having nuclear reduction talks with China and Russia, aims
to reduce overall threats to the U.S., but it would be difficult to get
China on board denuclearization talks.</p>

judge blocks Trump from sending transgender women to men’s prisons</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump’s
administration from moving transgender women to men’s prisons and ending
their gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>In a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump,
a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender
inmates who sued would likely succeed in arguing the policy was
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided
with LGBTQ+ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons from implementing the order.</p>
<p>Lamberth’s order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed
in federal women’s prisons. It goes further than a Jan. 26 decision by a
federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an
individual transgender woman to a men’s facility.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump
administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did
not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The three transgender women who brought the Washington case argued
transgender women would face violence and sexual assault in men’s
prisons, which would violate their right to not be subjected to cruel
and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.</p>
<p>U.S. Justice Department attorney John Robinson had argued that the
Bureau of Prisons has broad authority to make inmate placement
decisions. He urged Lamberth, an appointee of Republican President
Ronald Reagan, to wait for the agency to revise its policies before
issuing any order compelling the continuation of medical treatment.</p>
<p>In his decision, Lamberth wrote that the government did not dispute
the plaintiffs’ assertion that transgender persons were at a higher risk
of physical and sexual violence than other inmates when housed in a
facility corresponding to their biological sex.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order directed the federal government to only
recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house
transgender women in men’s prisons; and cease funding for any
gender-affirming medical care for inmates.</p>
<p>Prior to Trump’s order, the Bureau of Prisons had been operating
under guidelines adopted in 2022 during Democratic former President Joe
Biden’s tenure requiring prisons to consider inmates’ “current gender
expression” when deciding where to house them.</p>
<p>Biden’s policy was a reversal from earlier guidance during Trump’s
first term.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed on Jan. 30 also argued that Trump’s executive order
discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex in
violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p>About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial
facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of
Justice. About two thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of
whom are housed in men’s prisons.</p>

id="trump-takes-aim-at-new-south-african-land-expropriation-law">Trump
takes aim at new South African land expropriation law</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump has taken aim at a new South
African law meant to address the nation’s apartheid legacy of racially
unequal land distribution, threatening to withdraw funding, including to
the world’s largest HIV treatment program.</p>
<p>Africa observers told VOA on Tuesday that some members of the U.S.
Congress have jumped on this grievance to “upend the status quo in
U.S.-South Africa relations as a response.”</p>
<p>Trump fired the first volley Sunday night, in a post on his social
media site.</p>
<p>“South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of
people VERY BADLY,” Trump wrote. He continued to describe the situation
as “a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum.”</p>
<p>South African politicians — both the supporters and the opponents of
the newly inked Expropriation Act that Trump was referring to — quickly
fired back at his description of the new law, which repeals
apartheid-era legislation to align land distribution with the nation’s
progressive constitution.</p>
<p>Under the apartheid system, laws such as the 1913 Natives Land Act
severely restricted Black land ownership. Other now-defunct laws
determined where members of the nation’s Black majority could travel or
live, what public facilities they could use, and whom they could
marry.</p>
<p>Apartheid also denied full citizenship rights to Black people until
its fall in the early 1990s. Black people first gained the right to vote
in the 1994 elections that ushered in democratic rule.</p>
<p>“South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries,
has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage
of land and the protection of rights of property owners,” South African
President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement this week. “We look
forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform
policy and issues of bilateral interest. We are certain that out of
those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over
these matters.”</p>
<p>The new law allows for limited cases of land expropriation without
compensation, and that clause alone provoked years of public
consultations and debate in South African parliament and civil society
before it was adopted recently by the nation’s newly sworn-in coalition
government.</p>
<p>In her article on the website The Conversation, law professor Zsa-Zsa
Temmers Boggenpoel of Stellenbosch University explained the move as “a
potential tool to reduce land inequality.”</p>
<p>“This has become a matter of increasing urgency,” she wrote. “South
Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land
reform.”</p>
<p>A government land audit in 2017 found that 72% of the country’s farms
and agricultural holdings were white-owned.</p>
<p>“I am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver
bullet to effect large-scale land reform — at least not the type of
radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs,” Boggenpoel wrote.
“Understandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights.
But it still substantially protects landowners affected by
expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be
compensated.”</p>
<p>South Africa’s opposition parties stood against the new law.</p>
<p>After the bill was signed last month, opposition party ActionSA ,
which vowed to pursue legal action, said in a statement, “While other
parties assert that this bill does not compromise the ‘willing buyer,
willing seller doctrine,’ it ultimately allows the government to
unilaterally set the price if an agreement cannot be reached.”</p>
<p>The center-right Democratic Alliance party not only strenuously
opposed the new law — along with ActionSA and the pro-Afrikaner Freedom
Front Plus party — it also objected to Trump’s characterization, calling
it “unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“It would be a tragedy if this funding were terminated because of a
misunderstanding of the facts,” the party said in a statement. It
continued: “It is not true that the Act allows land to be seized by the
state arbitrarily, and it does require fair compensation for legitimate
expropriations in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>But these nuances may not be seized upon by the U.S. Congress, which
has bristled at some of Pretoria’s moves — not least, the nation’s
decision to pursue a genocide case against Israel at the U.N.’s highest
court, said Michael Walsh, an Africa analyst at the Foreign Policy
Research Institute,</p>
<p>The U.S. strenuously opposed South Africa’s petition to the court in
late 2023, with the White House telling VOA the case was “without
merit.”</p>
<p>“My key takeaway was [Trump’s] reference to massive human rights
violations,” Walsh told VOA. “That terminology will play into the hands
of those interest groups who have been pushing for Magnitsky sanctions
to be imposed on ANC and EFF officials prior to the G20 Johannesburg
Summit,” he added, referring to the African National Congress,
Ramaphosa’s party, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters.</p>
<p>The 2012 Magnitsky Act allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on human
rights violators.</p>
<p>“Many South African experts have assumed that any Magnitsky sanctions
would be based on acts of corruption,” Walsh said. “However, members of
Congress are considering Magnitsky sanctions on the grounds of human
rights violations as well.”</p>
<p>This all sets up the scene, he said, for a diplomatic showdown when
world leaders converge in Johannesburg in November for the summit of G20
nations.</p>
<p>Host nation South Africa has set the agenda for that meeting of the
world’s top 20 economies to include two issues that don’t jibe with
Trump’s isolationist, pro-energy exploration, America-first approach:
mobilizing climate financing and increasing debt relief for developing
countries.</p>

Treasury says Musk team has ‘read-only access’ to payment data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk’s
government-efficiency team has been granted “read-only access” to its
payment system codes and denied that this cut off any government
payments including for Social Security or Medicare.  </p>
<p>The confirmation of a Musk associate’s access to the system codes
came in a letter from a Treasury official to Democratic Senator Ron
Wyden. The letters said the review was being undertaken to “maximize
payment integrity for agencies and the public.” </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not commented on reports in
recent days that Musk’s informal Department of Government Efficiency had
gained access to the system responsible for disbursing more than $6
trillion of annual government spending.  </p>
<p>Several thousand people gathered outside the Treasury on Tuesday to
protest DOGE’s Treasury access amid his sweeping incursion into
government operations, which this week led to the shutdown of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, merging its aid mission into the
State Department. </p>
<p>The payment system review “is not resulting in the suspension or
rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other
federal agencies across the government,” Jonathan Blum, principal deputy
assistant secretary in the Office of Legislative Affairs wrote to
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon.  </p>
<p>The DOGE team at Treasury conducting the review is led by technology
firm chief executive Tom Krause, whom the letter described as a
“Treasury employee.” Krause is CEO of Cloud Software Group, which owns
former independent software firms Citrix and Tibco. </p>
<p>Wyden raised alarms over the weekend when reports first surfaced that
a team under the direction of Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump
to conduct a broad review of government operations, was at the Treasury.
 </p>
<p>“I’m sure the Treasury Secretary and the president want to save face
and downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power, but nothing they’re
saying is believable or trustworthy,” Wyden said in response to Blum’s
letter. </p>
<p>Outside the Treasury, protesters waved placards with slogans
including: “Nobody Elected Musk” and “Bessent, you have 1 job!! Protect
our money. You already failed.” </p>
<p>About three dozen Democratic members of the Senate and House of
Representatives tried to enter the Treasury to confront Bessent on the
issue but they said they were denied access. </p>
<p>Rebecca Weiss, who lives in suburban Maryland, told Reuters that she
attended the protest because she is worried about what Musk will do with
the payments data. </p>
<p>“He’s obviously a data guy, and now he has access, potentially, to
everybody’s personal identifiable information, which he might take
advantage of for his business purposes,” she said. “The bottom line is,
we didn’t elect him.”</p>

id="trump-reimposes-maximum-pressure-on-iran-aims-to-drive-oil-exports-to-zero">Trump
reimposes ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran, aims to drive oil exports to
zero</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday restored his
“maximum pressure” campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its
oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a
nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Trump signed the presidential memorandum reimposing Washington’s tough
policy on Iran that was practiced throughout his first term.</p>
<p>As he signed the memo, Trump described it as very tough and said he
was torn on whether to make the move. He said he was open to a deal with
Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader.</p>
<p>“With me, it’s very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” Trump
said. Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: “They’re too
close.”</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Iran is accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close
to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief
told Reuters in December. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear
weapon.</p>
<p>Trump’s memo, among other things, orders the U.S. Treasury secretary
to impose “maximum economic pressure” on Iran, including sanctions and
enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing sanctions.</p>
<p>It also directs the Treasury and State Department to implement a
campaign aimed at “driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.” U.S. oil prices
pared losses on Tuesday on the news that Trump planned to sign the
memo.</p>
<p>Tehran’s oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a
year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration
estimates. Output during 2024 was running at its highest level since
2018, based on OPEC data.</p>
<p>Trump had driven Iran’s oil exports to near-zero during part of his
first term after re-imposing sanctions. They rose under Biden’s tenure
as Iran succeeded in evading sanctions.</p>
<p>The Paris-based International Energy Agency believes Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members have spare capacity to
make up for any lost exports from Iran, also an OPEC member.</p>
<p>China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and Chinese firms buy the
most Iranian oil. China and Iran have also built a trading system that
uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar
and exposure to U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy, said the Trump
administration could enforce the 2024 Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum
(SHIP) law to curtail some Iranian barrels.</p>
<p>SHIP, which the Biden administration did not enforce strictly, allows
measures on foreign ports and refineries that process petroleum exported
from Iran in violation of sanctions. Book said a move last month by the
Shandong Port Group to ban U.S.-sanctioned tankers from calling into its
ports in the eastern Chinese province signals the impact SHIP could
have.</p>
<p>Trump also directed his U.N. ambassador to work with allies to
“complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on
Iran,” under a 2015 deal between Iran and key world powers that lifted
sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear
program.</p>
<p>Britain, France and Germany told the United Nations Security Council
in December that they are ready — if necessary — to trigger a snapback
of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from
acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 when a
2015 U.N. resolution expires. The resolution enshrines Iran’s deal with
Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China that
lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear
program.</p>
<p>Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, has said that invoking
the “snap-back” of sanctions on Tehran would be “unlawful and
counterproductive.”</p>
<p>European and Iranian diplomats met in November and January to discuss
if they could work to defuse regional tensions, including over Tehran’s
nuclear program, before Trump returned.</p>

id="former-google-engineer-faces-new-us-charges-he-stole-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies">Former
Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese
companies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment
accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing
artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies
he was secretly working for. </p>
<p>Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in
San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of
trade secrets. </p>
<p>Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term
and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum
10-year term and $250,000 fine. </p>
<p>The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on
four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers
did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p>Ding’s case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive
Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from
being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially
threatening national security. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware
infrastructure and software platform that lets Google’s supercomputing
data centers train large AI models. </p>
<p>Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give
Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which
design their own, and reduce Google’s reliance on chips from
Nvidia. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts
three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage
Chinese technology company. </p>
<p>Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May
2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a
China startup he founded, saying that country’s policies encouraged
development of a domestic AI industry. </p>
<p>Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law
enforcement. </p>
<p>According to court records describing a December 18 hearing,
prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a “potential resolution” to
Ding’s case, “but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.” </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California, No. 24-cr-00141.</p>

<h2 id="trump-orders-target-several-un-bodies">Trump orders target
several UN bodies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stopped U.S.
engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to
funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of
the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.</p>
<p>“It’s got great potential and based on the potential we’ll continue
to go along with it, but they got to get their act together,” Trump told
reporters. “It’s not being well run, to be honest and they’re not doing
the job.</p>
<p>“A lot of these conflicts that we’re working on should be settled, or
at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get
help. That should be the primary purpose of the United Nations,” the
U.S. president said.</p>
<p>U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, “From day one, U.S. support
for the United Nations has saved countless lives and advanced global
security.”</p>
<p>“The secretary-general looks forward to continuing his productive
relationship with President Trump and the U.S. government to strengthen
that relationship in today’s turbulent world.”</p>
<p>Trump said that he was not looking to take away money from the
193-member world body, though he complained that Washington had to pay a
disproportionate amount.</p>
<p>Washington is the U.N.’s largest contributor - followed by China -
accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping
budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8
billion, of which $1.5 billion is for the regular budget. These payments
are not voluntary.</p>
<p>UNRWA</p>
<p>Trump’s order on Tuesday was largely symbolic and mirrored moves he
made during his first term in office, from 2017-2021.</p>
<p>Since taking office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered
the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and from the
Paris climate agreement - also steps he took during his first term in
office.</p>
<p>The U.S. was UNRWA’s biggest donor - providing $300 million-$400
million a year - but former President Joe Biden paused funding in
January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking
part in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants Hamas
that triggered the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress then formally suspended contributions to UNRWA
until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides aid, health and education
services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
<p>The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been
involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and were fired. A Hamas commander
in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had
a UNRWA job. The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and
repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been
provided.</p>
<p>Human Rights Council</p>
<p>The first Trump administration also quit the 47-member Human Rights
Council halfway through a three-year term over what it called chronic
bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The U.S. is not currently a
member of the Geneva-based body. Under Biden, the U.S. was re-elected
and served a 2022-2024 term.</p>
<p>A council working group is due to review the U.S. human rights record
later this year, a process all countries undergo every few years. While
the council has no legally binding power, its debates carry political
weight and criticism can raise global pressure on governments to change
course.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order on Tuesday also asks Secretary of State Marco
Rubio to review and report back to him on international organizations,
conventions, or treaties that “promote radical or anti-American
sentiment.”</p>
<p>He specified that the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) should be reviewed first because Washington had
previously accused it of anti-Israel bias.</p>

<h2 id="the-migrant-workforce-under-trump">The migrant workforce under
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to overstate the role immigrant workers play in the U.S.
economy. Key industries rely on them —
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/23/trump-deportation-plans-food-system-00200013">nearly
half</a> of meat-processing jobs, for instance, are held by immigrants.
And many work in low-wage jobs that are vulnerable to exploitation.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting
Network, said Trump’s promises of mass deportations is creating fear and
uncertainty for immigrant workers, both authorized and unauthorized, as
well as for the massive food companies that employ them.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
“If history is any guide, this will probably mean increased food prices,
if only for companies trying to hedge against the possibility of
something disastrous happening,” said Genoways.
</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
On today’s show, Genoways gives us a snapshot of the low-wage immigrant
workforce’s role in our economy and unpacks how Trump’s deportation
plans could disrupt America’s food supply. Plus, why aren’t food
companies held accountable for exploiting their employees?

id="congressional-democrats-to-trump-changes-cant-be-done-in-secrecy">Congressional
Democrats to Trump: Changes can’t be done in secrecy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Congressional Democratic leadership warned President Donald Trump on
Tuesday that they would use upcoming government funding talks as
leverage to fight the administration’s changes in U.S. government
agencies.</p>
<p>Democrats’ warnings come as the Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE), led by Elon Musk, moved the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) under the control of the U.S. State Department
earlier this week. The administration has said they are reviewing
USAID’s foreign assistance activities to “ensure it is in alignment with
an America First agenda.”</p>
<p>“Whatever DOGE is doing, it’s not democracy,” Senate Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. “We know what democracy looks
like. It’s out in the open. It’s not secret.”</p>
<p>Democrats could push back on some of the most recent changes in the
U.S. government by withholding votes on a new spending bill. A
short-term continuing resolution keeping the government running is set
to expire on March 14.</p>
<p>On Monday, congressional Democrats protested outside closed USAID
offices, saying the Trump administration had overreached its
authority.</p>
<p>“If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law,”
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said. “You cannot wave away an agency
that you don’t like or that you disagree with by executive order, or by
literally storming into the building and taking over the servers. That
is not how the American system of government works.”</p>
<p>USAID manages tens of billions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance
programs.</p>
<p>“The Constitution requires that the funding be spent by the president
and the administration,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said
Tuesday. “The Constitution requires the president has a responsibility
to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Spending agreements
passed through the appropriations process are law, and when those laws
are violated, the Constitution is being violated, which is why there has
been a flurry of righteous litigation that has been unleashed.”</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans have expressed support for attempts to weed
out fraud and abuse in the U.S. aid system.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they’re closing an agency, but I do think they have
the right to review funding and how those decisions are made and what
priorities are being funded,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told
reporters Tuesday. “I think that’s probably true of any administration.
When they come in, there are lots of programs authorized and funded
through that agency, some which I think are operating the way in which
they were intended, some which aren’t.”</p>
<p>The White House criticized USAID-funded projects supporting
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and other efforts it
argues are a waste of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>“If there’s massive fraud, if the funds aren’t being directed to
where the Congress has appropriated and the president has signed, then
we need to know about that,” Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services
chairman, told American news networks CNN and CBS Monday.</p>
<p>“I have felt for a long time that USAID is our way to combat the Belt
and Road Initiative, which is China’s effort to really gain influence
around the world, including Africa and South America and the Western
Hemisphere,” Wicker continued. “So we need an aid program to match the
Chinese effort, but it needs to be done in a way that the policymakers
of the United States have decided ought to be done.”</p>
<p>Schumer said Tuesday he’s supportive of efforts to eliminate fraud
and abuse but criticized the speed and secrecy of the process.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order to
establish a nationwide “Iron Dome” missile defense system has sparked

id="rubio-pledges-us-support-for-costa-ricas-fight-against-cyberattacks-drug-trafficking">Rubio
pledges US support for Costa Rica’s fight against cyberattacks, drug
trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pledged
U.S. support to bolster Costa Rica’s cybersecurity defenses, 5G
telecommunications infrastructure, and its battle against narcotics.</p>
<p>Rubio made the statement at a joint press conference with Costa Rican
President Rodrigo Chaves, whose Central American nation faces more than
100 million cyberattacks annually.</p>
<p>“It’s very serious — 110 million cyberattacks a year for a country of
this size — it’s extraordinary, and they have faced it very bravely,”
Rubio told reporters in San Jose, Costa Rica’s capital.</p>
<p>In late 2024, local media reported that Costa Rican officials, in
collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, identified cyber intrusions by
criminal groups in China targeting the country’s telecommunications and
technology system, an allegation the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica
denied.</p>
<p>In August 2023, Chaves issued a decree regulating 5G mobile network
development, limiting involvement to companies based in signatory-states
to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime — an international treaty
addressing cybercrime.</p>
<p>San Jose should be lauded for being “very firm,” Rubio said, against
companies “backed by governments like the government of China that likes
to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion
to punish you.”</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment
but has not yet received a response.</p>
<p>US aid waiver</p>
<p>Rubio also vowed that Washington wouldn’t “eliminate foreign aid” but
prioritize assistance for trusted partners and allies. He pledged
continued cooperation with Costa Rica, offering FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration support to investigate drug trafficking to the U.S.</p>
<p>“We issued a waiver today because Costa Rica” has used U.S. aid
effectively to fix problems that also benefit the United States, Rubio
said. “They’re stopping drugs, they’re stopping criminals, they’re
identifying terrorists.”</p>
<p>The State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance has not responded
to VOA’s inquiry for further details on the waiver.</p>
<p>Rubio’s five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean
marks his first major diplomatic mission as secretary of state, with key
priorities including curbing illegal immigration into the U.S. and
combating drug trafficking.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, the secretary arrived in Guatemala following
discussions with leaders from Panama, El Salvador and Costa Rica. He is
scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.</p>

id="senate-committee-advances-robert-f.-kennedy-jr.-nomination-to-be-health-secretary">Senate
committee advances Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination to be health
secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental
lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday
to become the nation’s top health official when the senate finance
committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote. </p>
<p>Republicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats
all opposed. </p>
<p>His nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns
about the work he’s done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his
potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers. </p>
<p>To gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services
agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if
Democrats uniformly oppose him. </p>
<p>Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician
and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy’s
confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy’s hearings, Cassidy repeatedly
implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause
autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was “struggling”
with the vote. </p>
<p>“Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or
misleading arguments, concerns me,” Cassidy told Kennedy. </p>
<p>Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too,
because they voted against President Donald Trump’s defense secretary
nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy’s anti-vaccine
work. </p>
<p>In a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined
to say how he would vote on Kennedy’s nomination but reiterated
“vaccines are critically important.” </p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy’s
potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or
weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if
confirmed as health secretary. </p>
<p>“It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related
decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and
influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial
compensation for your family,” Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of
Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the
weekend to Kennedy. </p>
<p>Kennedy said he’ll give his son all of the referral fees in legal
cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring
clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he’s
referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that’s suing Merck’s
Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical
cancer. He’s earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three
years. </p>
<p>As secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public
health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible
for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for
millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases. </p>
<p>Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last
year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in
his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and
unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and
liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump
and Kennedy have branded the movement as “Make America Healthy
Again.”</p>

outlines pathways to decarbonizing the buildings sector, which produces
about one-third of global emissions. The analysis, from the Energy
Transitions Commission, proposes three main priorities that need to be
tackled:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Electrifying heating and cooking </strong>by swapping out fossil
fuel-based appliances. Doing this comprehensively by 2050 could “bring
annual emissions from building use close to zero” if we manage to
decarbonize the grid.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Boosting energy efficiency of appliances.</strong> Demand for
heat pumps and air conditioners will rise as the planet heats up, so we
need to find ways of squeezing more from these technologies while using
less energy. That includes making our buildings more energy efficient in
general.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Decarbonizing construction </strong>by finding low-carbon ways
to make building materials like steel and concrete, and using fewer
building materials overall. We should also be better utilizing the
buildings we already have.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
“This will require collaboration right across sector, between
governments, industry bodies, and private companies,” said Stephen Hill,
a sustainability and building performance expert at building design firm
Arup. “We need to be ambitious, but if we get it right we can cut
carbon, generate value for our economy, and improve people’s quality of
life through action like improving living conditions and reducing fuel
poverty.”

threaten to use US arms to thwart attempts to retake them</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD  — The Taliban have warned that the military weapons left
behind by the United States in Afghanistan now belong to them as “spoils
of war” and will be utilized to defend against any attempts to reclaim
them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The statement marks the first official response from the
internationally unrecognized government in Kabul to President Donald
Trump’s pledge on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve U.S.
arms from the de facto Islamist Afghan leaders.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The weapons that America abandoned in Afghanistan, as well as those
provided to the former Afghan regime, are now in the possession of the
Mujahideen [or Taliban forces] as spoils of war,” claimed Zabihullah
Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, while participating in an X
space session late on Monday.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Afghan people now own these weapons and are utilizing them to
defend their independence, sovereignty, and Islamic system. No external
force can compel us to surrender these weapons, nor will we accept any
demands for their surrender,” Mujahid stated. “We will use these weapons
to repel invaders who dare to seize them.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan for nearly two
decades to counter terrorist groups and protect the internationally
backed government in Kabul at the time. They hastily and chaotically
withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban
stormed back to power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7
billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after
the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including
aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons,
communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized
by the Taliban. </p>
<p>Trump stated in his pre-inauguration remarks at a rally in Washington
last month that his predecessor, Joe Biden, “gave our military
equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.” He went on to warn that
future financial assistance to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would be
contingent upon the return of U.S. military arms.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re
not going to give them the money unless they give back our military
equipment,” Trump said then, without elaborating.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mujahid, while speaking on Monday, rejected Trump’s assertions,
saying the Taliban have not received “a single penny” from the U.S. in
financial aid since regaining control of the country. He stated that
Kabul has neither anticipated nor sought any assistance from Washington.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban have displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called
victory day celebrations since returning to power in Afghanistan. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. troop exit from Afghanistan stemmed from the February 2020
Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the
then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military
withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on
that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-economic-forum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Appearing</u></a>
by video connection to the global plutocrats assembled recently at
Davos, Donald Trump interrupted a rambling answer to a question about
liquefied natural gas to proclaim that he had come up with a solution to
the energy demand of artificial intelligence (“I think it was largely my
idea, because nobody thought this was possible”), which is to build
power plants near data centers to power them. And a key part of the
equation should be coal. “Nothing can destroy coal — not the weather,
not a bomb — nothing,” he said. “But coal is very strong as a backup.
It’s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn’t cost much
more — more money. And we have more coal than anybody.”
</p>
<p>
There is some truth there — the United States
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coal-proved-reserves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>does
in fact</u></a> have the largest coal reserves in the world — and AI may
be offering something of a lifeline to the declining industry. But with
Trump now talking about coal as a “backup,” it’s a reminder that he
brings up the subject much less often than he used to. Even if coal will
not be phased out as an electricity source quite as quickly as many had
hoped or anticipated, Trump’s first-term promise to coal country will
remain a broken one.
</p>
<p>
Yet in an unusual turn of events, the anticipated explosion of demand
for electricity on its way over the next few years has led some
utilities to
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/electric-power/110524-us-power-generators-pump-the-brakes-on-coal-plant-retirements#:~:text=Duke%20Energy%20Indiana%2C%20in%20an,and%20natural%20gas%20through%202038." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scale
back</u></a> their existing plans to shutter coal-fired power plants,
foreseeing that they’ll need every electron they can generate.
Ironically,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/georgia-power-coal" target="_self"><u>especially
in Georgia</u></a>, that need is driven by a boom in green
manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, coal’s decline is still remarkable. At the start of the
21st century, coal was the primary source of electricity generation in
32 states; now
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that
number</u></a> is down to 10 and dropping. As recently as 2007, coal
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accounted</u></a>
for half the country’s electricity; the figure is now 16%. Worldwide
coal demand keeps
<a href="https://www.mining.com/web/coal-demand-to-keep-hitting-records-through-2027-iea-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increasing</u></a>,
mostly because of China and India. But here in the United States, the
trajectory is only going in one direction.
</p>
<p>
Confronted with those facts, a politician could take one of two basic
paths. The first is to make impossible promises to voters in coal
country, telling them that the jobs that have disappeared will be
brought back, their communities will be revitalized, and the dignity
they feel they have lost will be returned.
</p>
<p>
That was the path Donald Trump took. He talked a lot about coal in 2016,
making grand promises about the coal revival he would bring if elected.
At a rally in West Virginia, he donned a hardhat, pretended to shovel
some coal,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-receives-warm-welcome-in-coal-country/2016/05/06/9259c5ea-1327-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_video.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and
said</u></a>, “For those miners, get ready, because you’re going to be
working your asses off.” And in Trumpian style, if he couldn’t keep the
promise, he’d just say he did. “The coal industry is back,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/us/politics/trump-coal-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> in 2018, a year which saw the
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40212#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20plant%20owners%20retired,15%20GW%2C%20occurred%20in%202015." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second-most
coal capacity retired</u></a> in the country’s history to that point.
“We’re putting our great coal miners back to work,”
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/14/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-pa-hes-putting-our-grea/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> on the campaign trail in 2020, when the number of
coal-producing mines in the U.S.
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined
by 18%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
When Trump took office in January 2017, there were just over 50,000 coal
jobs left in the country after
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades
of decline</u></a>. When he left office in 2021, the number was down to
38,000. The number is slightly higher today at around 43,000, but it’s
still infinitesimal as a portion of the economy.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s failure to bring back coal jobs wasn’t because his affection for
the fuel source was insincere. He certainly had as coal-friendly an
administration as one could imagine; his second pick to run the
Environmental Protection Agency was a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-nominates-acting-epa-head-an-ex-coal-lobbyist-to-run-agency-idUSKCN1P326H/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coal
lobbyist</u></a>. But the triumvirate of forces that drove those job
reductions — automation, emissions-limiting regulations, and competition
from fracked natural gas — were irresistible.
</p>
<p>
The second path for a politician confronting the structural decline of
coal is to take concrete steps to create new opportunities in coal
country that offer people a better economic future. That was what the
Biden administration tried to do. As part of its clean energy push,
Biden put a particular focus on siting new projects in underserved
communities, including in areas where coal still defines the culture
even though the jobs are long gone. The administration also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241107062156/https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-425-million-decarbonize-and-manufacture-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directed</u></a>
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding “to ensure former coal
communities can take full advantage of the clean energy transition and
continue their leading role in powering our nation,” in the words of
then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Or as the Treasury Department
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/anchoring-clean-energy-manufacturing-investments-in-coal-country-and-beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
it</u></a>, the administration was working “to strengthen the economies
of coal communities and other areas that have experienced
underinvestment in past decades.” These were real commitments, backed up
by real dollars.
</p>
<p>
Today, the new Trump administration is committed to freezing, reversing,
and clawing back as much of Biden’s clean energy agenda as it can.
Whether that includes these investments in coal country remains to be
seen.
</p>
<p>
There’s good reason to believe it will, however, both because of the
antipathy Trump and his team hold for anything that has Biden’s
fingerprints on it, and because Trump understands the fundamental truth
of his political relationship to coal country: Its support for him is
unshakeable, no matter the policy outcome.
</p>
<p>
Take just one example: Harlan County, Kentucky, site of the
extraordinary 1976 documentary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County,_USA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Harlan
County, USA</em></em></u></a>, which chronicled a strike by miners
demanding fair wages and working conditions. Coal is still being mined
in Harlan County, but
<a href="https://eec.ky.gov/Energy/News-Publications/Quarterly%20Coal%20Reports/2023-Q2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
of 2023</u></a>, only 577 people there were employed in the industry, or
about one in every 19 working-age people in the county. It
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/harlancountykentucky/PST045224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remains</u></a>
overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly poor — and the voters there love
Trump. He got 84.9% of the vote in 2016, 85.4% in 2020, and 87.7% in
2024.
</p>
<p>
It might be fair to ask what people in Harlan County and across coal
country have to show for their support for the president. The absolute
best he can offer them is that while coal will continue to decline under
his presidency, it might decline a bit slower than it otherwise would
have. Even if escalating electricity demand offers an opportunity for
the coal industry, there’s little reason to believe it will
<em><em>reverse</em></em> coal’s decline in America. At most it could
flatten the curve, allowing some coal plants to remain in operation a
few years longer than planned.
</p>
<p>
A future where coal is at most a miniscule part of America’s energy mix
with a tiny labor force producing it seems inevitable. Most people in
coal country understand that, as much as they might like it to be
otherwise. If only their favorite politician would admit it to them —
and commit to offering them more than fables — they could start building
something better.

hosting Netanyahu for White House talks amid Gaza ceasefire</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday at the White House with Israel’s
ceasefire with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip at the top of the
agenda.</p>
<p>The talks come at a key phase in the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have
less than four weeks to agree on the terms of the second phase, which
would include the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a
permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the
territory.</p>
<p>“I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,” Trump told
reporters Monday.</p>
<p>Ahead of the White House visit, Netanyahu met Monday with U.S. Middle
East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the push to secure the
ceasefire deal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the meeting was “positive
and friendly,” and that he would meet with his Security Cabinet upon
returning from the U.S. in order to “discus Israel’s overall positions
regarding the second stage of the deal.”</p>
<p>Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian officials
as the three countries continue in their role of mediating the halt in
fighting.</p>
<p>In addition to the ceasefire, Netanyahu said he and Trump would
discuss countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations
with Arab countries.</p>
<p>Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab
countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in
which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>But Saudi Arabia has said it would only agree to such a deal if the
war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state
in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East war.  </p>
<p>The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu’s government
is opposed.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so
far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas
militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more
than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has
killed.   </p>

<h2 id="us-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-go-into-effect">US tariffs on
Chinese goods go into effect</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Tuesday, with
China quickly announcing tariffs on U.S. imports in response.</p>
<p>China said it would impose 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and liquified
natural gas, as well as 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery
and some automobiles.</p>
<p>The U.S. measures involve a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which
Trump announced in an effort to pressure China to take action to prevent
fentanyl smuggling into the United States.   </p>
<p>The U.S. government has identified China as a major source of the
precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture
fentanyl.</p>
<p>China has said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and
illicit drug trade.</p>
<p>“China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they’re
not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,” Trump said.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump
would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.</p>
<p>Trump on Monday announced a one-month pause for the 25% tariffs on
Mexican and Canadian goods after he spoke with Mexican President Claudia
Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to try
to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States.</p>
<p>“Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking
from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,” Sheinbaum
posted on X after talking with Trump. “The United States commits to work
to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.”</p>
<p>The Mexican leader added that the two countries would continue talks
on security and trade and that “the tariffs are put on pause for a month
from now.”</p>
<p>Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along
its border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl.</p>
<p>“I just had a good call with President Trump,” Trudeau said on X.
“Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work
together.”</p>
<p>Both Sheinbaum and Trudeau, representing two of the three biggest
U.S. trading partners along with China, protested Trump’s tariff plans
and vowed to retaliate.</p>
<p>Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council,
said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown over
tariffs as a trade war, despite the planned retaliations from Mexico,
Canada and China and the risk of escalation.</p>
<p>“Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100%
clear that this is not a trade war,” Hassett said. “This is a drug
war.”</p>
<p>Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest
U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher
prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods, but said
the higher tariffs would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S.
interests.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay
the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other
countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher
costs to consumers, rather than absorb their extra expenses
themselves.</p>
<p>Tensions ramped up Monday with the leader of Canada’s most populous
province of Ontario announcing that he is ending a contract with Elon
Musk’s Starlink internet services in response to Trump’s new tariff on
Canada. Musk, possibly the world’s richest man, is a key Trump adviser
seeking to sharply cut U.S. government spending and trim the ranks of
2.3 million federal civilian workforce through buyouts.</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American
companies from provincial contracts, signed a $68 million deal with
Musk’s company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote
residents in rural and northern Ontario.</p>
<p>“We’ll be ripping up the province’s contract with Starlink. Ontario
won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,” Ford
said in a post on X.</p>

visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration and security
ties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to hold
meetings Tuesday with officials in Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as
part of a tour of Latin America focused on migration, security
cooperation and countering Chinese influence in the region.</p>
<p>Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with President Nayib
Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to accept any deportees
from the United States, regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>“He’s also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently
in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though
they’re U.S. citizens or legal residents,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>The U.S. government cannot legally deport U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Rubio said El Salvador would fully cooperate on the repatriation of
Salvadorans who are in the United States illegally, calling the deal
“the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory
agreement anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Bukele said on X that his government offered the U.S. “the
opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,” with El Salvador
accepting a fee to hold convicted criminals in its Terrorism Confinement
Center mega prison.</p>
<p>“The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us,
making our entire prison system sustainable,” Bukele said.</p>
<p>The State Department said Rubio also raised strategies to counter the
influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere to
safeguard the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the
region.</p>
<p>His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing
foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional
Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to
another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign
aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy

<p>Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador also signed a
memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation,
expanding strategic relations between the two nations.</p>
<p>The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward
building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy

<p>On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs
Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and
facilitating trade between the two countries.</p>

<p>Chinese influence</p>
<p>U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran
President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi
Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019.</p>
<p>During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development
projects for the Central American country through a series of
agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a
tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements.</p>
<p>In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free
trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary
trading partner.</p>
<p>El Salvador formally recognized the People’s Republic of China on
Aug. 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Panama</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight
departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens
of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and
11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal
records.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat said it sent “a clear message” that people who
sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent
back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2024, the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl
Mulino’s term, the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding
aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing
through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States.</p>
<p>The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by
the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried
out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a
previous pause on U.S. foreign aid.</p>
<p>“This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of
mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,” Rubio told
reporters at the Albrook International Airport.</p>
<p>“This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we’ve issued,”
he added. “We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this
cooperation.”</p>
<p>Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7
million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their
countries of origin.</p>
<p>Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40
charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14
countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations
have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the
Darién region compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Canal controversy</p>
<p>On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will “take necessary
measures” if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S.
President Donald Trump described as China’s “influence and control” over
the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,”
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after
Rubio’s talks with Mulino.</p>
<p>Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017
memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will
seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their
official expiration dates.</p>
<p>“We’ll study the possibility of terminating it early,” Mulino added
on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure
project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to
connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United
States has cautioned that the BRI “is fueled by China’s mission to
manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its
own benefit.”</p>
<p>At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the
accusations against China as “totally false” and “pointless.” He said
that China has never participated in the management or operation of the
Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect
for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral
international gateway.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew
the BRI agreement “regrettable.”</p>
<p>After visiting Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala, Rubio’s
trip closes with a stop in the Dominican Republic.</p>

suggests Ukraine’s rare minerals as condition for continued support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he would possibly be interested in
continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare
earth minerals.</p>
<p>“We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to
secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,”
Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump has indicated Ukraine is open to the possibility of an
agreement of delivering rare earth minerals to the U.S. in exchange for
the continuation of U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia,
according to an Associated Press report.</p>
<p>“We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great
rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing
to do it,” the U.S. president said.</p>
<p>Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine, include lithium and
titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech
products.</p>
<p>In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s
president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against
Russia’s ongoing attacks.  He said Russia is “focusing primarily” on
Ukraine’s energy sector.</p>
<p>“They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to
the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,”
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>“There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,” the
president said and urged Ukraine to “be much faster” in adjusting to the
continuous changes. </p>
<p>The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for
the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies are
“critical and must not stop.”   </p>
<p>“We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense,
increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand
localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,” the
president said. “This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s
future depends on it.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy also said in his daily address that he talked Monday with
Ukraine’s military Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi about
modernizing the country’s armed forces. </p>
<p>As part of that discussion, the two men also talked about appointing
corps commanders who “must be the most prepared, most promising
officers, with combat experience and [a] modern mindset.” </p>
<p>While the president said, “The army must be modern,” he also said,
“most importantly, it must value its people.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Russian officials said that Ukrainian drone attacks
targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia.</p>
<p>Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones
destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery.</p>
<p>Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused
on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing
no casualties.</p>
<p>The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the
attacks.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 70 Ukrainian
drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan,
Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions.</p>
<p>Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks
damaged three houses and an agricultural business.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that
Russian forces launched in overnight attacks.</p>
<p>The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv,
Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia
and Zaporizhzhia regions.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone
debris damaged four residential buildings.</p>
<p>Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged
a school.</p>

<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El
Salvador on Monday to press the country to stem the flow of illegal
migration and address other strategic issues. </p>
<p>His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing
foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional
Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to
another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign
aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy
directives. </p>
<p>The same day, Rubio also held one-on-one talks with Salvadoran
President Nayib Bukele at Lake Coatepeque, San Salvador, as part of his
five-nation Central American tour focused on curbing illegal
immigration, countering China’s influence in the Western Hemisphere, and

id="american-bald-eagles-are-having-a-moment-ecologically-culturally">American
bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically, culturally</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST ORANGE, New Jersey — Along the long road from American icon to
endangered species and back again, the bald eagle — the national bird of
the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky — is having a
moment.</p>
<p>The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since
the early 2000s, when the federal government took the thriving birds off
its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally,
too, the animals are soaring.</p>
<p>In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the
country’s national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a
bit). New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as
endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures
associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a
single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of
football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship
in the Super Bowl this weekend.</p>
<p>How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales,
it’s complex.</p>
<p>Their well-being was intertwined with an insecticide</p>
<p>The story — there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the
1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance — centers on the banning of DDT,
a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included
thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of
eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in
1972.</p>
<p>To rebuild the birds’ numbers in their historic range across the
country, conservationists imported birds from places where their
populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also
removed eggs from nesting birds’ nests, replacing them with artificial
ones for the eagles to “incubate” while the real eggs were safely
hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their
parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey’s
Endangered and Nongame Species Program.</p>
<p>“They’re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that
almost went extinct on our continent. And so, I think now it’s really
important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,” said
Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation
in Alaska.</p>
<p>Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the
period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part
of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons.
One is that they’re “fairly adaptable” and now live across densely
populated (with people) New Jersey — from suburban Bergen County near
New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.</p>
<p>She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town —
New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans — that found
itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer
observers worried over the bird’s well-being, given the realities of
suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle,
identified by a band. It had apparently made it.</p>
<p>“Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such
a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time
understanding,” she said. “They’re Jersey birds. You got to have
attitude, right?”</p>
<p>The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though.
Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban
northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by
cars. </p>
<p>There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open
water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there’s
also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says
officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.</p>
<p>A resurgence in popularity, too</p>
<p>Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines
recently for finally getting their due as the county’s national bird, an
oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the
national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy
Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last
month.</p>
<p>She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans’ groups
to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically
divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are
revered in several Native American cultures as symbols of strength,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a
retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.</p>
<p>The eagles’ perch as symbols of the country contributes to their
conservation, with experts considering them an “umbrella species,” whose
need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser-known
wildlife.</p>
<p>“Americans are always going to have that sort of personal
relationship with bald eagles,” Clark said.</p>
<p>New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a native of Philadelphia Eagles territory,
took his two young sons to the NFC championship game last week, a memory
he said they won’t forget. “Let’s never forget that Bald Eagle was
officially named America’s national bird at the same time the Eagles are
headed back to the Super Bowl,” he said in a text message.</p>
<p>Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you’re driving
along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a
birder who’s spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on
nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered
never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New
Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in
his green “Birds” cap and binoculars.</p>
<p>“Just the mere thrill of seeing one — a lot of people just have
never, ever looked at one,” he said. “It really elevates your day to see
a bald eagle.”</p>
<p>Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because
rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain
work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
official: “I don’t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being
on the brink there, not knowing if… if you’re going to be able to save
the species.”</p>

Stradivarius violin could become most expensive instrument ever
auctioned</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has
the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold
when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby’s in New York.</p>
<p>The auction house is estimating the value of the “Joachim-Ma
Stradivarius” at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end
of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another
Stradivarius, the “Lady Blunt,” made in 1721 and named by Guinness World
Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction.</p>
<p>Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby’s Americas president and head of global
business, said Stradivari made the violin during his “Golden Period,”
which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his
craftmanship.</p>
<p>“So, this is the peak of his output,” Jimenez said. “This is the best
violin of this era.”</p>
<p>Sotheby’s says the violin’s preservation is remarkable, and its
ownership history extraordinary.</p>
<p>It’s named for two of its famed owners — violin virtuosos Joseph
Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was
born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died 2009.</p>
<p>It is believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced
by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his “Violin Concerto in D Major” because
of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during
the concerto’s 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>Ma acquired the violin in 1969, and his estate gifted it to the New
England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the
conservatory, where he earned a master’s degree in 1950. The
conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the
proceeds going to student scholarships.</p>

id="trump-administration-opens-antisemitism-inquiries-at-5-colleges-including-columbia-and-berkeley">Trump
administration opens antisemitism inquiries at 5 colleges, including
Columbia and Berkeley</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration is opening new investigations into
allegations of antisemitism at five U.S. universities including Columbia
and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department
announced Monday.</p>
<p>It’s part of President Donald Trump’s promise to take a tougher
stance against campus antisemitism and deal out harsher penalties than
the Biden administration, which settled a flurry of cases with
universities in its final weeks. It comes the same day the Justice
Department announced a new task force to root out antisemitism on
college campuses.</p>
<p>In an order signed last week, Trump called for aggressive action to
fight anti-Jewish bias on campuses, including the deportation of foreign
students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests.</p>
<p>Along with Columbia and Berkeley, the department is now investigating
the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Portland State
University. The cases were opened using the department’s power to launch
its own civil rights reviews, unlike the majority of investigations,
which stem from complaints.</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment were left with all five universities.</p>
<p>A statement from the Education Department criticized colleges for
tolerating antisemitism after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and
a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that followed. It also criticized the
Biden administration for negotiating “toothless” resolutions that failed
to hold schools accountable.</p>
<p>“Today, the Department is putting universities, colleges, and K-12
schools on notice: this administration will not tolerate continued
institutional indifference to the wellbeing of Jewish students on
American campuses,” said Craig Trainor, the agency’s acting assistant
secretary for civil rights.</p>
<p>The department didn’t provide details about the inquiries or how it
decided which schools are being targeted. Presidents of Columbia and
Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last
year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of
antisemitism. The hearings contributed to the resignation of multiple
university presidents, including Columbia’s Minouche Shafik.</p>
<p>An October report from House Republicans accused Columbia of failing
to punish pro-Palestinian students who took over a campus building, and
it called Northwestern’s negotiations with student protesters a
“stunning capitulation.”</p>
<p>House Republicans applauded the new investigations. Representative
Tim Walberg, chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, said he was
“glad that we finally have an administration who is taking action to
protect Jewish students.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order also calls for a full review of antisemitism complaints
filed with the Education Department since Oct. 7, 2023, including
pending and resolved cases from the Biden administration. It encourages
the Justice Department to take action to enforce civil rights laws.</p>
<p>Last week’s order drew backlash from civil rights groups who said it
violated First Amendment rights that protect political speech.</p>
<p>The new task force announced Monday includes the Justice and
Education departments along with Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“The Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this
hatred wherever it is found,” said Leo Terrell, assistant attorney
general for civil rights. “The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is the
first step in giving life to President Trump’s renewed commitment to
ending anti-Semitism in our schools.”</p>

Department workers put on leave over DEI order</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Dozens of employees at the U.S. Education Department
were put on paid administrative leave in response to President Donald
Trump’s order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the
federal government, according to a labor union that represents hundreds
of workers in the agency.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many workers were put on leave or for what reasons,
said Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government
Employees Local 252. The majority of employees placed on leave do not
work in DEI initiatives and span all branches of the agency, she said,
from an office that sends billions of dollars to K-12 schools to an
office that enforces civil rights laws.</p>
<p>The shakeup comes as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency,
or DOGE, pushes to cut programs and federal workers at departments
across the government, including the U.S. Agency for International
Development.</p>
<p>A DOGE team was working at the Education Department on Monday to
implement Trump’s executive orders and agenda, said Madison Biedermann,
an Education Department spokesperson.</p>
<p>The department did not immediately comment on the personnel changes
and would not say how many employees were placed on leave.</p>
<p>At least 55 Education Department workers received an email Friday
saying they were being put on paid leave effective immediately pursuant
to Trump’s executive order. It wasn’t being done for “any disciplinary
purpose,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Those placed on leave lost access to their government email accounts
and were told not to report to the office. They include a range of staff
members and managers across the department, which employs more than
4,000 workers in Washington and regional offices across the country.</p>
<p>Most of those on leave appear to have taken a voluntary diversity
training seminar offered by the department, Smith said. The Diversity
Change Agent program has been promoted by the agency for years,
including during Trump’s first term in office.</p>
<p>Graduates of the two-day program were expected to serve as role
models and help improve the department’s “capacity to attract and retain
a diverse workforce,” according to an internal email from 2019 obtained
by the AP.</p>
<p>Smith said hundreds of employees have taken the training, but it was
unclear if all of them were placed on leave. She said many people were
under the impression the training was strongly encouraged or
required.</p>
<p>“It seems unfair to encourage or require people to take a training
and then four or five years later place them on administrative leave,”
Smith said.</p>
<p>Some current employees who are on leave said the action could disrupt
the agency’s core work, including the management of federal student
loans and the FAFSA form for student financial aid. The workers spoke on
the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a former teacher and member of the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is
“purging” employees for taking a training course that his administration
encouraged them to take.</p>
<p>“This won’t help our kids learn or even save us money,” Murray said
on the social media site X. “He’s just breaking services people rely
on.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order called for all DEI staff in the federal government to
be put on paid leave and eventually laid off. It’s part of a broader
crackdown on diversity programs that the Republican president says are
racist.</p>
<p>Trump campaigned on a promise to shut down the Education Department,
which he says has been infiltrated by “radicals, zealots and Marxists.”
He said the agency’s power should be turned over to states and
schools.</p>

<h2 id="us-foreign-aid-programs-face-major-restructuring-under-trump">US
foreign aid programs face major restructuring under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which manages
tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. foreign aid programs, was
essentially closed down on Monday, with employees locked out of their
offices and computer systems. Several senior figures in the agency were
placed on leave as the Trump administration took steps to fold its
functions into the Department of State. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, where he was traveling,
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now USAID’s acting director
and would be taking steps to bring the agency’s activities in line with
the policies of the administration.</p>
<p>Rubio described the agency as historically “unresponsive” to Congress
and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to
take its direction from the State Department.</p>
<p>“USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that
there’s somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,”
Rubio said. “These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people
assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on
something that furthers our national interest.”</p>
<p>Rubio’s comments were less harsh than those of billionaire Elon Musk,
who President Donald Trump has given significant power to overhaul the
federal government, and whose newly formed Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) sent representatives into USAID offices over the
weekend.</p>
<p>“USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote on the social media
platform X on Sunday. “Time for it to die.”</p>
<p>Democrats protest</p>
<p>Democrats in Washington described the effort to dismantle USAID as
blatantly illegal and vowed to challenge it.</p>
<p>On Sunday, all 10 Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee sent a letter to Rubio outlining their objections.</p>
<p>“Congress established the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) as an independent agency, separate from the Department of State,
to ensure that we can deploy development expertise and U.S. foreign
assistance quickly, particularly in times of crisis, to meet our
national security goals,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“For this reason, any effort to merge or fold USAID into the
Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed,
and approved by Congress,” the letter said.</p>
<p>In a news conference in front of USAID headquarters in Washington,
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said that he and his colleagues would prevent Trump from
filling vacancies at the State Department in response to the
administration’s actions. </p>
<p>“We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from
going forward until this illegal action is reversed,” he said.</p>
<p>USAID history</p>
<p>USAID was created in the early 1960s, at a time when there was a
widespread understanding in post-World War II Washington that U.S. aid
efforts, administered by a patchwork of agencies, were inefficient,
often duplicative, and sometimes contradictory.</p>
<p>In many cases, aid was also explicitly tied to the United States’
political priorities, rather than the objective level of need present in
nations receiving assistance.</p>
<p>In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad
review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the
authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts.</p>
<p>In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would
create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in
recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as “a
carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the
resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of
individual, unrelated projects.”</p>
<p>“Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not
been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development
program,” Kennedy said. “Long-term planning and financing — the only way
to make meaningful and economical commitments.”</p>
<p>Created by executive order</p>
<p>Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing
the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their
operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from
humanitarian aid programs.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued
Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International
Development.</p>
<p>The agency was structured such that its administrator reported
directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of
command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed
USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged
repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to
force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department
policies.</p>
<p>Many successes</p>
<p>Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number
of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals,
many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of
the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world,
and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures
was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop
flourishing industrial bases.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global
effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million
people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped
spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that
contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the
human population through a public health program. </p>
<p>USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT)
for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of
water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths
of millions of children in developing countries.</p>
<p>The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the
incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth
and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular
HIV.</p>
<p>Controversies</p>
<p>Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be
disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history,
found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in
Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in
the national interest.</p>
<p>Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the
war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful
“pacification” programs meant to win the “hearts and minds” of the
Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on
that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid
programs.</p>
<p>Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts,
directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign
governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the
neediest.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge,
none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities
during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were
raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent
funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.</p>

Other Funding Freeze Attacks Environmental Justice</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Amidst the chaos surrounding President Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ira-funding-pause" target="_self"><u>pause
on infrastructure and climate spending</u></a>, another federal funding
freeze is going very much under the radar, undermining energy and
resilience projects across the U.S. and its territories.
</p>
<p>
Days after Trump took office, acting Energy Secretary Ingrid Kolb
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-halts-diversity-equity-work-and-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly
told</u></a> DOE in a memo to suspend any work “requiring, using, or
enforcing Community Benefit Plans, and requiring, using, or enforcing
Justice40 requirements, conditions, or principles” in any loan or loan
guarantee, any grant, any cost-sharing agreement or any “contracts,
contract awards, or any other source of financial assistance.” The memo
stipulated this would apply to “existing” awards, grants, contracts and
other financial assistance, according to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmnorthey.bsky.social" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>E&amp;E
News</em></em></u><u>’ Hannah Northey</u></a>, who first reported the
document’s existence.
</p>
<p>
Justice40 was Biden’s signature
<a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/tracker/rollback-trump-rescinded-bidens-executive-order-14008-that-established-justice40-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
justice initiative</u></a>. Community benefit plans were
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250109182715/https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/local-investments-map-demonstration-and-deployment-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>often
used by Biden’s DOE</u></a> to strengthen the potential benefits that
projects could have on surrounding local economies and were seen as a
vehicle for environmental justice. When we say <em><em>often</em></em>,
we mean it: some high profile examples of these plans include those used
for the
<a href="https://www.powermag.com/doe-loan-programs-office-publishes-community-benefits-plans-for-energy-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Holtec
Palisades nuclear plant restart in Michigan</u></a> and the agency’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Community-Benefits-Plans-Training-for-DPA-Heat-Pumps-and-Advanced-Manufacturing-Grants-Applicants.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery
materials processing and recycling awards</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
After Kolb’s edict went out, companies, states, cities, and other
entities with DOE contracts that had community benefit plans embedded in
them were ordered to stop all work, according to multiple letters to
contract recipients reviewed by Heatmap News. “Recipients and
subrecipients must cease any activities, including contracted
activities, and stop incurring costs associated with DEI and CBP
activities effective as of the date of this letter,” one letter reads,
adding: “Costs incurred after the date of this letter will not be
reimbursed.”
</p>
<p>
One
<a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>such
letter</u></a> was posted by the University of Michigan research
department in an advisory notice. The department’s
<a href="https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/CBP%20and%20DEI%20Notification%20to%20existing%20recipients%20-%201.27.2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
summarizes the letter as “directing the suspension” of all work tied to
“any source of DOE funding” if it in any way involved “diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs,” as well as Justice40 requirements
and community benefits plans.
</p>
<p>
These letters state companies and other entities with community benefit
plans in their contracts or otherwise involved in their funding awards
would be contacted by DOE to make “modifications” to their contracts.
They only cite President Trump’s executive orders that purportedly
address Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices; they do not cite a
much-debated Office of Management and Budget
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-funding-freeze-chaos" target="_self"><u>memo
freezing</u></a> all infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act
spending, which has been challenged in federal court. It is altogether
unclear if any outcome of the OMB memo litigation is even relevant to
this other freeze.
</p>
<p>
We reached out to the Energy Department about these letters for comment
on how many entities may be impacted and why they targeted community
benefit plans. We will update this story if we hear back.
</p>
<p>
A lot is still murky about this situation. It is unclear how many
entities have been impacted and the totality of the impacts may be
unknown for a while, because a lot of these entities supposed to get
money may want to keep fighting privately to, well, still get their
money. It’s also hazy if all entities that received these letters are
continuing to do any construction or preparatory work or other labor
connected to their funding not tied to the community benefit planning,
or just halting the funded labor altogether.
</p>
<p>
The blast radius from this freeze is hard to parse, said Matthew Tejada,
a former EPA staffer who most recently served as the agency’s deputy
assistant administrator for environmental justice under the Biden
administration. Tejada, who now works for the advocacy group NRDC and
remains connected to advocates in the environmental justice space, said
he was very much aware of this separate freeze when he was first reached
by Heatmap. But “unless you’re able to really have a network of
information bottom up from the recipients, it’s a bit of a black box
we’re operating around because we’re not going to get transparency and
information from the administration.“
</p>
<p>
“Part of their obvious strategy here is to create enough confusion as
possible to make defending as difficult as possible. But I’m fairly
certain the community and various others here – local governments,
tribes – will have plenty to say about cutting through that chaos to
make sure the will of Congress and the outcomes of these programs and
projects are delivered upon.” He believes that any attempts to modify
these contract awards “on the pretext of canceling the contract[s] will
in all likelihood meet a legal challenge.”
</p>
<p>
But the ripple effects of this other freeze are starting to surface in
local news accounts.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/local/2025/01/28/trump-federal-funding-freeze-affecting-city-of-erie-schember-witherspoon/77993701007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
</u><u><em><em>Erie Times-News</em></em></u></a>, the city of Erie,
Pennsylvania currently cannot access funding for a city-wide audit for
home energy efficiency. And a big road improvement project in the
Mariana Islands – a U.S. territory – was nearly derailed by the freeze,
according to the news outlet
<a href="https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/beach-road-project-barely-escapes-funding-halt-order/article_92296652-debb-11ef-a74f-27fec0895987.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Mariana’s
Variety</em></em></u></a>, which reported project developers are just
going to try and move forward without the remaining money provided under
contract.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have to wait and see the breadth of the impacts here and whether
this freeze will produce its own legal or regulatory rollercoaster. Hang
on tight.

Tariffs Could Hurt Gas Cars More Than EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE1MzU5NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjA4MzY2NH0.FxjaiVOyJ7SLMhU2BzS0d39Z9HJSKfuT-vwZoiQXHPM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If President Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada — which
were set to begin tomorrow morning before the two countries’ leaders
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/mexico-tariff-pause" target="_self"><u>negotiated
30-day delays</u></a> — were to go into effect, they would hit
automotive supply chains like a lightning bolt. A single spring inside a
fuel pump can zig-zag across the northern and southern U.S. borders half
a dozen times before making it into a vehicle. The jolt of tariffs would
follow it, gathering force at each crossing before shocking car buyers
with higher prices.
</p>
<p>
Electric vehicles, however, famously do not have as many parts as
conventional cars. There’s no engine, transmission, exhaust system, or
fuel pump. EV drivers will also not have to contend with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>the
effect of tariffs on the price of gasoline</u></a>. So does it follow
that, despite Trump’s wish to undo Biden’s EV subsidies, he would
actually be making battery-powered cars more competitive?
</p>
<p>
Experts I spoke with agreed that EV manufacturers might be somewhat less
exposed. But the tariffs will still affect them, and the small edge
could be outweighed by other Trump administration policies.
</p>
<p>
An internal combustion engine vehicle can have 20,000 to 30,000 parts,
Amy Broglin-Peterson, an expert in automotive supply chains at Michigan
State University, told me; an electric vehicle might have anywhere from
several hundred to a few thousand. Many of these components are
manufactured by independent specialists throughout North America.
“They’ll be assembled utilizing cheaper Mexican labor, and then they’ll
cross back into the U.S. and be put into a bigger assembly, which is
then sent back down again for either more assembly work or finished
vehicle production,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Electric vehicles also contain many of the same complex components as
conventional cars, like seats and lights and dashboards and radios and
mirrors. “That’s kind of the great equalizer amongst these different
vehicles,” Mike Wall, an auto analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility told
me. “They’re all going to be in the same soup in terms of vulnerability
to cross-border trade.”
</p>
<p>
But EVs lack the most complex component of all — the engine. Instead,
EVs have a battery, and many automakers are either already producing
their batteries in the U.S. or are building new factories to do so. As
of December, there were more than 80 facilities making battery
components, assembling battery packs and cells, manufacturing drive
units, producing EV chargers, and doing final EV assembly in the U.S.,
<a href="https://www.charged-the-book.com/na-ev-supply-chain-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to a database</u></a> maintained by Wellesley University historian Jay
Turner. But that’s set to increase over the next few years due to tax
incentives and grants that were part of Biden’s Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which reward domestic
manufacturing of clean technology components. More than 200 additional
facilities, including critical mineral extraction and processing
facilities, are in various stages of development.
</p>
<p>
Broglin-Peterson told me her quick answer to my question is that EVs
likely wouldn’t be hit quite as hard by tariffs as conventional cars.
But she emphasized that they will still see an impact, and she wasn’t
sure of the extent to which other Trump administration policies would
undermine any tariff-related advantages. “The EV picture right now has
become a lot more murky, obviously, since President Trump was elected,”
she told me. “I do think the traditional automakers are more heavily
leveraged, though, on their internal combustion engine supply chains.”
</p>
<p>
Wall agreed that EVs were somewhat less exposed, but he said it really
depends on which internal combustion engine vehicle you’re comparing
them to. Some engines are assembled in the U.S. and have more
U.S.-manufactured components than others. Battery makers are still
vulnerable, as the processing of the critical minerals that go into EV
batteries is currently
<a href="https://www.resources.org/common-resources/critical-minerals-for-electric-vehicles-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heavily
concentrated in China</u></a>, which will also be hit by 10% tariffs on
top of
<a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/united-states-finalizes-section-301-tariff-increases-imports-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existing
tariffs</u></a> on Chinese goods. When you take into account the
president’s plans to end the electric vehicle tax credit and leasing
option, which can shave up to $7,500 off a car’s sticker price, EVs
could still end up less competitive than before Trump took office, Wall
said.
</p>
<p>
Some electric vehicle producers will be hit harder than others. Tesla,
for instance, has one of the lowest exposures to non-U.S. content,
according to
<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/part-583-american-automobile-labeling-act-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
collected by the Department of Transportation. But some 20% to 25% of
Tesla components come from Mexico.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,” Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla’s
chief financial officer, said during an earnings call last week. “Over
the years, we’ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but
we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our
businesses.” The company’s stock price dropped 5% on Monday, though that
may be partly because the company also
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-loses-market-share-sweden-norway-musk-looms-large-2025-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost
market share in Europe</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Rivian builds its EVs in Illinois and is opening a second factory in
Georgia. But the company’s CEO RJ Scaringe
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/749147/rivian-ceo-trump-tariffs-mexico/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>Inside EVs</em></em></u></a> that tariffs will still
hurt. “Many, many, many hundreds of billions of dollars have been
invested in Mexico in production capacity for supply chains that supply
to all of us,” he said. “That will need to get remapped or will just
carry higher costs.”
</p>
<p>
Other manufacturers are more spread out. Ford assembles its Mustang

Analysts told me not to expect any sudden moves from car companies.
“Revamping the automotive supply chain to be 100% U.S. based is probably
not realistic,” David Whiston, an equity strategist who covers the auto
sector for Morningstar, told me in an email. “Companies right now are
not willing to pivot capacity on a dime — they won’t allocate capital
without more certainty.”
</p>
<p>
Trump doesn’t have much interest in certainty. After threatening to put
the tariffs into immediate effect last weekend, the president quickly
struck agreements with Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to pause the tariffs for 30 days
while the countries negotiate. He has yet to discuss next steps with
China.

extends block on Trump administration federal funding freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A judge in the nation’s capital kept a temporary block
on a Trump administration plan for a freeze on federal funding Monday
after some nonprofit groups said they’re still struggling to get
promised grants and loans.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued
last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in
federal spending. While the memo outlining it has since been rescinded,
the Republican administration has said some kind of funding freeze is
still planned as part of his blitz of executive orders.</p>
<p>A second judge in Rhode Island has also blocked any federal spending
pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen Democratic
states.</p>
<p>In the Washington lawsuit, several groups reported being unable to
access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. They
ranged from childcare in Wisconsin to disability services in West
Virginia to a small business research project on neutron generation and
detection.</p>
<p>“For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative,
impending, and potentially catastrophic,” AliKhan wrote.</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues a brief pause in funding to align
federal spending with the president’s agenda is within the law, and the
court lacks constitutional authority to block it.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s executive orders have sought to increase
fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and
end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.</p>
<p>AliKhan though, found that “furthering the President’s wishes cannot
be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases,” she wrote, referring to
the Office of Management and Budget, the White House office that doles
out federal money.</p>
<p>Lawyers with the advocacy group Democracy Forward are representing
the nonprofits. They say the sweeping funding pause breaks federal law,
puts nonprofits at risk of being shuttered and violates their First
Amendment rights.</p>

id="tariff-threats-take-aim-at-fentanyl-trafficking-heres-how-drug-reaches-us">Tariff
threats take aim at fentanyl trafficking; here’s how drug reaches
US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico,
Canada and China is partly aimed at combating the illicit flow of
fentanyl into the U.S., where the opioid is blamed for some 70,000
overdose deaths annually. </p>
<p>Mexico agreed Monday to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border
as part of a deal with Trump to pause the tariffs for a month — and hold
off levying its own. </p>
<p>Neither Canada nor China has signaled major changes to tackle the
flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and each has said it would retaliate for
any U.S. tariffs. </p>
<p>What role do Mexico, Canada and China play in fentanyl reaching the
U.S.? And how much can their governments do? </p>
<p>Where does fentanyl come from? </p>
<p>The ingredients in fentanyl are largely produced by companies in
China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers.
But a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco
cartels in Mexico. </p>
<p>Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into
the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona.
The small amounts of fentanyl in any shipment — the drug is 50 times
more potent than heroin — and its lack of odor make detection and
seizures extremely challenging. </p>
<p>Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a
much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 19.5 kilograms (43
pounds) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year,
compared with 9,570 kilograms (21,100 pounds) at the Mexican
border. </p>
<p>Seizures of fentanyl jumped by as much as tenfold under President Joe
Biden, an increase that may reflect improved detection. </p>
<p>What changed after Trump threatened tariffs? </p>
<p>Mexico announced in December the seizure of more than a ton of
fentanyl pills in what it described as the largest bust of synthetic
opioids in the country’s history. The haul was striking because fentanyl
seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of
2024. </p>
<p>Under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October,
Mexico’s security forces appear to be far more aggressive than they were
under her predecessor. Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador
denied that fentanyl was even produced in Mexico, contradicting
officials in his own administration. </p>
<p>To pause the tit-for-tat tariffs, Mexico agreed to immediately deploy
10,000 National Guard troops to the border to battle drug-trafficking,
while the U.S. committed to do more to stop the trafficking of guns into
Mexico, said Trump and Sheinbaum on social media. </p>
<p>Facing tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has
highlighted his country’s recent $1.3 billion investment in border
enforcement, including chemical detection tools at entry ports and a new
unit focused on the oversight of precursor chemicals. </p>
<p>Once Trump ordered the tariffs, Trudeau rebuked the move. </p>
<p>“We, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl,” Trudeau
said at a press conference Sunday. “As neighbors, we must work
collaboratively to fix this. Unfortunately, the actions taken today by
the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together.” </p>
<p>China defended its efforts to combat fentanyl in what has been years
of touch-and-go cooperation with the U.S. China doesn’t have the same
fentanyl crisis among its own population, and doesn’t view it as a
priority, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at
the Council on Foreign Relations. </p>
<p>How much can Mexico, Canada and China do? </p>
<p>Combating the production and movement of illicit fentanyl is
particularly challenging. </p>
<p>Unlike heroin and cocaine, which are produced from plants, fentanyl
is made with ingredients used for legal pharmaceutical drugs, and can be
made in cheap labs that can be erected relatively quickly. And despite
the dangers, demand in the U.S. for the highly addictive drug remains
strong. </p>
<p>Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency, said he was skeptical that Mexico’s extra
troops at the border on their own would make much of a dent in
trafficking. </p>
<p>Once fentanyl leaves the labs, it’s usually well concealed in hidden
compartments of vehicles or in huge cargo trucks; better detection
technology is crucial, in addition to more troops, he said. The other
challenge, Vigil said, is that combating the fentanyl trade will likely
require more than just collaboration between the U.S. and its
neighbors. </p>
<p>“Even if Mexico, Canada and these other countries snap their fingers
and did away with the drug trade, as long as we have that demand, there
will be another country that will satisfy that demand.”</p>

athletes bring buzz to New Orleans before Super Bowl</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Super Bowl isn’t just a game on Sunday, it’ll
involve a nearly weeklong spectacle taking over New Orleans with
non-stop entertainment leading up to the big showdown between the Kansas
City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. </p>
<p>While the Chiefs and Eagles gear up for their championship rematch,
the Big Easy will be the epicenter for star-studded concerts, exclusive
parties, a comedy show, and guest lists filled with A-listers. From Post
Malone, Cardi B to Shaquille O’Neal, the city will be buzzing long
before Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs attempt a monumental
three-peat. </p>
<p>“It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be different than other Super
Bowls,” said O’Neal, who will host his popular carnival-themed Shaq’s
Fun House on Friday night. It’s a hot ticket — starting at $199 — for
the NBA legend’s over-the-top festival event featuring headline
performances from Ludacris, John Summit and O’Neal under his stage name
DJ Diesel. </p>
<p>O’Neal’s event will feature several attractions including a Ferris
wheel, circus performers and premium bar. This will be somewhat of a
homecoming week for O’Neal, who played college hoops at Louisiana State
University and visits Louisiana about four times a year. </p>
<p>For Flavor Flav, he wants to help lift morale in New Orleans
following the aftermath of the terror attack that killed 14 people on
New Year’s Day. </p>
<p>“This is going to be special. I’m here to uplift spirits,” said Flav,
who will perform at Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Tailgate along with Diplo and
Cowboy Mouth on Sunday afternoon. It’s free for general admission with
paid upgraded experiences for $49.99 and $349 for a VIP ticket. </p>
<p>“I’m getting on the turntables to make people party and have a good
time,” he said. </p>
<p>Along with those events, here’s a look at some of the invite-only and
public events during a busy Super Bowl week: </p>
<p>Fanatics party </p>
<p>Michael Rubin’s Fanatics Super Bowl party is impossible to get into
without an invite. The star-studded affair on Saturday afternoon is
strictly for the who’s who of sports and entertainment. </p>
<p>Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will likely be front and
center, taking in performances from Post Malone, Travis Scott, Don
Tolliver and many more. </p>
<p>The expected attendees include big names such as Kim Kardashian,
Justin Bieber, Lil Baby, Tiffany Haddish and Tom Brady. </p>
<p>Madden Bowl </p>
<p>Just like EA Sports’ iconic phrase, “It’s in the game,” Jelly Roll,
Chris Stapleton and Shaboozey will literally be in the game at the
Madden Bowl. </p>
<p>The trio is set to separately take the stage Friday night, bringing
the hype before the competition kicks off. </p>
<p>“I can’t wait to keep this party going,” Shaboozey said. </p>
<p>Along with performances, the event will include the Madden NFL 25
Championship Series in front of a live audience — where two of the
world’s best players will travel to New Orleans for their share of the
$1 million prize pool. </p>
<p>Double up for some, triple duties for others </p>
<p>The Madden Bowl won’t be the only stage where Stapleton will showcase
his powerhouse vocals. The country star is set to headline the SiriusXM
and Pandora concert Thursday night. </p>
<p>Stapleton’s performance will air on SiriusXM’s Chris Stapleton Radio,
an exclusive channel curated and presented by him and his band. Pandora
listeners can access the Chris Stapleton Radio station. </p>
<p>After Ludacris takes the stage at Shaq’s Fun House on Friday, the
rapper will perform Sunday at On Location’s Super Bowl pregame party.
He’ll be joined by rock band The Revivalists at the Club 67 and
Touchdown Club just outside the Caesars Superdome for One Location — a
premium hospitality provider of the NFL. </p>
<p>Post Malone will be making moves too. He’s scheduled to perform at
three different events. Along with Fanatics, the superstar artist will
hit the stage at the Bud Light Backyard Tour on Friday, then he’s set to
headline the YouTube Tailgate Concert on Sunday near the Superdome. </p>
<p>Diplo will perform at parties for Sports Illustrated and Maxim along
with Guy Fieri’s tailgate event. </p>
<p>Gospel celebration </p>
<p>Bill Bellamy and Rocsi Diaz will bring some gospel flavor to the Big
Easy. </p>
<p>The tandem will host the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration on Wednesday
night. The lineup includes some of music’s best from The Isley Brothers,
Muni Long, Yolanda Adams, Tori Kelly and Jonathan McReynolds. </p>
<p>Other performances include New Orleans natives Master P, Big Freedia,
Lucky Daye and Trombone Shorty. The NFL Players Choir will also
participate. </p>
<p>“Hosting the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration is like hitting the
trifecta: music, faith, and football all in one show,” Bellamy said.
“I’m excited to bring some laughs, some energy and to be part of this
incredible night with an amazing lineup.” </p>
<p>Michael Strahan, an NFL Hall of Famer and Good Morning America
co-anchor, will receive the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He called the
honor “truly special.” </p>
<p>New Orleans Saints player Cameron Jordan will be given the community
award while Los Angeles Rams star rookie Jared Verse will be honored
with the rising star award. </p>
<p>Timbaland and Maxim </p>
<p>Super producer Timbaland will bring his massive hits into New Orleans
with the help of Maxim. </p>
<p>Timbaland will perform at a special concert at the Maxim Saints &amp;
Sinners Big Game Party on Saturday. The show will include performances

Gras,” 50 Cent will hold the Super Bold Comedy Block Party with standups
from Bill Bellamy, Chico Bean and DC Young Fly. </p>
<p>Dom Dolla and Diplo will perform at the Sports Illustrated
Party. </p>
<p>On Friday, Nelly and the Chainsmokers are set to perform at h.wood
Homecoming and the Draft Kings event. Shannon Sharpe and Chad

id="dramatic-drop-in-monarch-butterfly-count-nears-record-30-year-low">Dramatic
drop in monarch butterfly count nears record 30-year low</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MADISON, WISCONSIN — The number of monarch butterflies spending the
winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest
mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and
climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>The survey began in 1997</p>
<p>Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black
wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United
States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World
Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs
west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California
coast.</p>
<p>The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting
western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja
California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28
years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The
organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in
2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second
lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs
in 2020.</p>
<p>The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa
Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies
this year.</p>
<p>Heat may have doomed western monarchs</p>
<p>Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them
vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect’s caterpillars. The
plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires,
agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a
group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much
of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western
population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species
biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already
small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year
may have slowed breeding.</p>
<p>Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 37.7 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) and any temperatures above 42.2 C (108 F) are lethal
to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July
that drove temperatures in some areas well past 37.7 C (100 F). Palm
Springs, for example, hit a record 51.1 C (124 F) on July 5. Another
heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple
cities breaking heat records.</p>
<p>Western monarchs’ future looks murky</p>
<p>Pelton said that it’s too early to tell what long-term impact the
dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population.
Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After
bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to
247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The
year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.</p>
<p>“This is bad news,” Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. “But we
have seen incredible recovery. This doesn’t mean we’re not going to have
western monarchs. It’s hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set
them back pretty significantly.”</p>
<p>Federal officials working on protections</p>
<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it
was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit
anyone from killing them, transporting them or making changes that would
render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as
eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect
1,779 hectares (4,395 acres) in seven coastal California counties that
serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.</p>
<p>A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The
agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened
if officials decide to move forward.</p>
<p>Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental
Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects
on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.</p>

administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000
Venezuelans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/MARACAIBO, Venezuela — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary
Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation
from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President
Donald Trump’s expanding immigration crackdown.</p>
<p>The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected
Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be
deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government
notice.</p>
<p>The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and
no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20 vowing to crack down on
illegal immigration and humanitarian programs he says go beyond the
intent of U.S. law. Trump tried to end most enrollment in the temporary
protection program during his first term but was stymied by federal
courts.</p>
<p>The status is available to people whose home country has experienced
a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what will happen,” said Venezuelan migrant Ana Maria
Pirela, 26, who lives in California and has temporary protected
status.</p>
<p>“Yesterday they fired my husband from his job — he had been managing
a food store for two months — and I’m two months pregnant. I don’t want
to go back to Venezuela,” she said by phone.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, greatly expanded the
temporary protection program. It now covers more than 1 million people
from 17 nations, some in the U.S. for decades, and they could face
immediate deportation if they lose the status.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans arrived in the U.S. during
Biden’s presidency, many via legal humanitarian pathways, and deporting
them has been challenging due to frosty U.S.-Venezuela relations. On
Saturday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to accept all deported people
but provided few details.</p>
<p>Last week, Noem canceled an 18-month extension of temporary
protections for Venezuelans by her Biden-era predecessor, saying the
Trump administration did not want to be bound by that determination. On
Monday, she stopped their status from automatically renewing for six
months. </p>
<p>About 300,000 additional Venezuelans have Temporary Protected Status
that expires in September and were not affected by Monday’s
decision.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said in the termination notice
that while some challenging conditions remain in Venezuela, “there are
notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public
health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned
to their home country.”</p>
<p>The termination will be effective 60 days after publication in the
Federal Register, the notice said, or about the first week in April.</p>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government has taken some steps
to control inflation, which previously was in the triple digits, but
economic conditions in Venezuela remain dire for most people. The
monthly minimum wage equals about $3.</p>
<p>Maduro was inaugurated for his third term in January, despite a
six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand
aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture.</p>
<p>The U.S. charged Maduro and several allies with drug trafficking in
2020, charges he denies. </p>
<p>The Venezuelan opposition, which has faced arrests and other
crackdown measures since the July election, asked the U.S. to keep the
temporary protection program in place.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who moved abroad after Venezuela
issued an arrest warrant for him, recently said on X that the opposition
was still discussing with the U.S. how to protect Venezuelans there.</p>
<p>Venezuelan migrant Tatiana Vazques, who lives in Atlanta, said by
phone that her family submitted a U.S. asylum application but was
anxious after seeing other Venezuelans arrested by U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>“Yesterday ICE took a friend and her husband. There’s anguish,” she
said.</p>

chief travels to Mexico border as Trump cracks down on migration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Texas on
Monday to visit the southern border as President Donald Trump works to
implement a hard-right agenda that includes boosting the U.S. military
presence to keep out illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>In his first trip as Pentagon chief, Hegseth will survey operations
and meet with U.S. troops who have been rushed to the region under
Trump.</p>
<p>“Looking forward to meeting our great warriors and seeing the hard
work they are doing securing our southern border. We will continue to
deliver on this vital mission,” Hegseth wrote on X in a post announcing
his arrival.</p>
<p>Trump ordered 1,500 additional military personnel to the border just
days after taking office, and his administration carried out highly
publicized immigration raids and arrests. Some migrants have been
deported using military aircraft.</p>
<p>Border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a
national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico on his first day in
office.</p>
<p>The additional personnel have increased the total number of
active-duty troops deployed there to around 4,000.</p>
<p>Ahead of his border visit, Hegseth posted on X that Trump “wants 100%
operational control of the border — and we will deliver.”</p>

markets pare losses after Trump pauses tariff on Mexican imports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. stock markets fell sharply in early trading Monday but pared
their losses after President Donald Trump paused a planned 25% tariff on
Mexican imports.</p>
<p>The three major U.S. stock indices — the Dow Jones Industrial Average
of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy
NASDAQ — all dropped nearly 2% or more on fears that Trump’s new tariffs
targeting Canada, China and Mexico would threaten the global
economy.</p>
<p>But the losses were cut in half after Trump paused the levy on
Mexican goods for a month, even though his planned 25% tariff on
Canadian goods and a 10% levy on Chinese imports were still set to take
hold at midnight.</p>
<p>Trump was planning further discussions mid-afternoon Monday with
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about the
tariffs.</p>
<p>Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 2.66%, while South Korea’s KOSPI
index finished off 2.5%. </p>
<p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading
before rallying to close down just .07%.</p>
<p>Britain’s FTSE index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 all dropped
more than 1%.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico both announced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to
Trump’s move before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told Trump she
would send 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try
to curb the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. and Trump
paused his tariff on Mexican imports.</p>
<p>China has pledged to file a protest with the World Trade Organization
over the Trump tariff increase on its exports to the U.S. </p>
<p>Canada, China and Mexico are the top three U.S. trade partners. </p>

orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy
TikTok</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on
Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a
sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok. </p>
<p>“We’re going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We’re
going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the
American people,” he told reporters. “There’ll be a combination of
liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring
them out for the American people.” </p>
<p>Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as
a presidential candidate, saying it could fund “great national
endeavors” like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports,
manufacturing, and medical research.  </p>
<p>Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were
not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded
by “tariffs and other intelligent things.” Typically such funds rely on
a country’s budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at
a deficit. </p>
<p>There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8
trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign
Wealth Funds. </p>
<p>TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken
offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to
either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on
Jan. 19.  </p>
<p>Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order
seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. </p>
<p>Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over
TikTok’s purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app’s
future in February.</p>

<p>
U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum
announced a month-long pause on across-the-board 25% tariff on Mexican
goods imported into the United States that were to take effect on
Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Sheinbaum had agreed to
deploy 10,000 Mexican troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, “specifically
designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our
Country.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of the Treasury
Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will lead talks
in the coming month over what comes next.
</p>
<p>
“I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President
Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two Countries,”
Trump wrote.
</p>
<p>
In her own statement, Sheinbaum said the U.S. had committed to work on
preventing the trafficking of firearms into Mexico.
</p>
<p>
There has still been no pause on planned tariffs on Canadian imports,
which would likely affect the flow of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil,
minerals, and lumber</u></a>, as well as possibly break automobile
supply chains in the United States. Canadian leaders announced several
measures to counter the tariffs at both the federal and provincial
level.
</p>
<p>
Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have spoken today, and
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-speak-trade-war-1.7448805" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/03/us/trump-tariffs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>be
able to get a similar deal</u></a>, a Canadian official told <em><em>The
New York Times</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>UPDATE</em> <em>4:55 p.m. ET:</em> Trudeau
<a href="https://x.com/JustinTrudeau/status/1886529228193022429" target="_blank">announced</a>
that he had reached a similar deal that would stave off the imposition
of tariffs for a month. Following a “good call” with Trump, Trudeau said
in a post on X that he would deploy personnel and resources to his
country’s southern border. “Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and
will be working on protecting the border,” Trudeau wrote. He also said
that Canada would have a “Fentanyl Czar” and would “launch a Canada-
U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money
laundering.”<br/>

return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair
collision</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to
retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter
that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed
in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has
said they are confident all will be found.</p>
<p>Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on
Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane.
More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said.</p>
<p>Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and
salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving
debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of
Engineers said Sunday.</p>
<p>The “dignified recovery” of remains takes precedence over all else,
he said.</p>
<p>Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday
night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet
with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard —
will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for
investigation.</p>
<p>The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was
about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no
survivors.</p>
<p>On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to
the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after
colliding. The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from
the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of
hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that
led to the collision.</p>
<p>Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope
to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday’s crash was the
deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New
York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on
board and five on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the
crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced
pilots.</p>

<li>Trump tariffs on Canada and Mexico loom
</h3>
<p>
On Saturday evening, President Trump signed orders placing 25% tariffs
on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10% tariff on
Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources. Trump also
imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China. If the tariffs go
into effect tomorrow as planned, they will affect nearly half of
America’s imports and reshape some of the world’s most important energy
and trading relationships. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to

from First Street. Extreme weather is causing insurance costs to rise,
while also changing the desirability of certain areas. This convergence
“suggests there may be fundamental restructuring of home values across
the U.S. in the coming decades,” with property values expected to fall
across the country. Some statistics from the report:
</p>
<p>
<strong>55 million</strong> – Total number of Americans expected to
voluntarily relocate to avoid climate risks by 2055.<br/><strong>5.2
million</strong> – Americans expected to do so this
year.<br/><strong>12.8 million</strong> – Americans expected to relocate
because of wildfire smoke particulate matter by 2055. Nearly 12 million
will move because of flooding, 14.7 million because of extreme heat, and
11 million due to drought.<br/><strong>31%</strong> – increase in the
cost of homeowners insurance since 2019.<br/><strong>22%</strong> – rise
in inflation during the same time.<br/><strong>322%</strong> – expected
increase in Miami’s insurance premiums by 2055. Florida’s premiums have
already gone up by 47% in just five years due to intensifying
hurricanes.<br/><strong>73%</strong> – share of Americans that consider
climate risks when buying a home.<br/><strong>4,107</strong> –
neighborhoods currently classified as “climate resilient,” with low
climate risks and stable insurance rates. These neighborhoods are
expected to drive much of the population growth through 2055. However,
high-risk areas with rising insurance premiums are also projected to
grow until they reach a “tipping point” into population
decline.<br/><strong>21,750</strong> – “climate abandonment”
neighborhoods that are seeing premiums go up and populations go down.
These represent 26% of all neighborhoods.<span></span>

id="south-africa-defends-itself-against-trump-and-musk-attacks-on-land-policy">South
Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks
on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South
African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said
he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. </p>
<p>Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that “South Africa is
confiscating land” and “certain classes of people” were being treated
“very badly.” </p>
<p>“I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a
full investigation of this situation has been completed!” he said. </p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not
confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to
foster a better understanding over the matter. </p>
<p>The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to
South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The
lion’s share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa’s
HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on “no other significant funding”
from the United States. </p>
<p>The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for
the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections
by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark
racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after
the end of apartheid in 1994. </p>
<p>“The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation
instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures
public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the
constitution,” the presidency said. </p>
<p>The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South
Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black
people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. </p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person and a South African-born U.S.
citizen who has Trump’s ear and more than 200 million followers on the X
social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. </p>
<p>“Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?” he said in a post on
X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He
was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he
alleged. </p>
<p>Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk
constructively with the South African president. </p>
<p>“My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of
centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our
constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past,” he
said. </p>
<p>Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before
expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being
unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. </p>
<p>South Africa’s rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday
after Trump’s remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also
tumbled. </p>
<p>Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners,
said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand
an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important
investor than China and Europe. </p>
<p>But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious
challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish
economy and attract foreign investors, he said. </p>
<p>“The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory
in a country where today, Trump’s cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow,
he’s ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday,
he’s adding 25% tariffs because they’re too close to China,” he
said.</p>

staffers told to stay out of Washington headquarters after Musk said
Trump agreed to close it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International
Development were instructed to stay out of the agency’s Washington
headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them, after
billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with
him to shut the agency.</p>
<p>USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who
reported being locked out of the agency’s computer systems overnight.
Those still in the system received emails saying that “at the direction
of Agency leadership” the headquarters building “will be closed to
Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.”</p>
<p>The developments come after Musk, who’s leading an extraordinary
civilian review of the federal government with the Republican
president’s agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump
about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and “he agreed we
should shut it down.”</p>
<p>“It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,” Musk
said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. “What we have is just a
ball of worms. You’ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It’s
beyond repair.”</p>
<p>“We’re shutting it down,” he said.</p>
<p>Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid
and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and
security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms,
accusing it of promoting liberal causes.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security
chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified
material in restricted areas to Musk’s government-inspection teams, a
current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier
carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining
access to sensitive information including the Social Security and
Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a
senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk’s team accessing
sensitive information.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks
constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional
approval and decrying Musk’s accessing sensitive government-held
information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal
government agencies and programs.</p>
<p>USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been
one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in
an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its
programs.</p>
<p>“It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them
out,” Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Musk’s and Trump’s comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio
out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in
office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down
USAID.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented
freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID’s aid
programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid
organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the
agency’s leadership and staff in Washington..</p>
<p>Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump’s first
term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they
believe that agency outsiders with visitors’ badges asking questions of
employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk’s DOGE
team.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump
was allowing Musk to access people’s personal information and shut down
government funding.</p>
<p>“We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people
from harm,” the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.</p>

proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting
part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump’s move to
withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the
agency, a document released on Monday showed.</p>
<p>Opening the agency’s annual executive board meeting, WHO Director
General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency’s work and
recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit
and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change.</p>
<p>“We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member
states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,” he
said.</p>
<p>The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting,
during which member state representatives will discuss the agency’s
funding and work for the 2026-2027 period.</p>
<p>The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the
budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a
document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion
budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for
polio eradication and tackling emergencies.</p>
<p>“With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget
could not be ‘business as usual,’” the document reads. The U.S. is the
WHO’s biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall
funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps
after the U.S. move.</p>
<p>However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message
that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the
challenges, the document adds.</p>
<p>The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for
the previous period, 2024-2025.</p>
<p>Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago.
The process will take one year under U.S. law.</p>

has billed the one-day gathering as a “retreat” devoted to defense
policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion
without any official declaration or decisions.</p>
<p>The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the
United States, meaning Trump’s sweeping weekend move on tariffs is
certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon
face similar measures.</p>
<p>Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also
be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that
European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less
on the United States via the NATO security alliance.</p>
<p>Trump’s call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United
States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic
pressure to force Copenhagen’s hand - has also added strains to
trans-Atlantic ties.</p>
<p>The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities
they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they
might cooperate more through joint projects.</p>
<p>“Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense,”
Costa said in a letter to the leaders. “It needs to become more
resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security
and defense actor.”</p>
<p>Finding funding</p>
<p>The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to
diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public
finances for big spending hikes.</p>
<p>Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint
EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are
staunchly opposed.</p>
<p>One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants
for defense projects, according to some diplomats.</p>
<p>European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years,
particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war
to the EU’s borders.</p>
<p>But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more.
Trump has said NATO’s European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense
- a figure no member of the alliance including the United States
currently reaches.</p>
<p>Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense -
about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates.</p>
<p>That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also
masks wide divergences among EU countries.</p>
<p>Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders
in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according
to NATO estimates. But some of the EU’s biggest economies such as Italy
and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.</p>

to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with
U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington
focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s
ceasefire positions.</p>
<p>The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the
second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on
matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and
an end to the conflict that began in October 2023.</p>
<p>Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with
officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the
ceasefire negotiations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald
Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas,
countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with
Arab countries.</p>
<p>Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end
wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the
ceasefire agreement. </p>
<p>During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas
has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its
control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite
Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said
they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second
phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of
Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. </p>
<p>Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing
partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in
early March. </p>
<p>It’s not clear where Trump stands. </p>
<p>Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over
Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants’
shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the
capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both
living and dead. </p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more
than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has
killed. </p>
<p>Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. </p>
<p>An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people
on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to
Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military
said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint
while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab
countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in
which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in
Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in
Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in
the 1967 Middle East war. </p>
<p>The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu’s government
is opposed. </p>
<p>Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has
ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military
said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of
Jenin, to the town of Tamun. </p>
<p>The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war
in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There
has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and
Palestinian attacks on Israelis. </p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuter</p>

id="trump-to-speak-with-canadian-mexican-leaders-after-imposing-new-tariffs">Trump
to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the
leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods
from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of
retaliatory tariffs and other actions.</p>
<p>The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump
said the move would be “worth the price” to bolster U.S. interests.</p>
<p>Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his
first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two
countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy
in addition to already enacted tariffs. </p>
<p>Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt
illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the
United States. </p>
<p>In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American
consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs.</p>
<p>U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to
import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if
not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their
extra expenses themselves. </p>
<p>Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the
closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55
billion trade deficit with Canada last year. </p>
<p>“Why? There is no reason,” Trump contended. “We don’t need anything
they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have
more Lumber than we can ever use.” </p>
<p>“Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable
Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished
51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the
people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!” Trump said. </p>
<p>He said, “Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name,
continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE,
CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into
AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!” </p>
<p>With the new tariffs, Trump said, “Will there be some pain? Yes,
maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will
all be worth the price that must be paid.” </p>
<p>Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs
could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed
that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years
were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat
Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher
grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada
at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity
prices. </p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country
would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American
goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a
second one in three weeks. </p>
<p>Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced
retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor
purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S.
state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky,
three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented
by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. </p>
<p>Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s
“This Week” show, “We’re really disappointed” and “perplexed” by Trump’s
actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But
she acknowledged that “it’s really in the president’s hands” whether
that happens. </p>
<p>She said that “less than 1% of illegal immigrants” entering the U.S.
travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has
invested “in a lot of equipment” to curb unauthorized border crossings
and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to know what more we could do,” she said. “We’re not at
all interested in escalating” a trade war with the U.S., where she said
99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. “We’re eager to build on
that.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed
her economy minister to “implement Plan B,” which includes
yet-unspecified “tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s
interests,” without specifying what U.S. goods her government will
target.  </p>
<p>U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census
Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth
of Mexican products. </p>
<p>Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined
forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff
increases. </p>
<p>“We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the
Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as
any attempt to intervene in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote on X. “If
there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the
United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these
criminal groups.” </p>
<p>China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying
it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take
unspecified “countermeasures.” The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit
with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading
partners. </p>
<p>That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had
marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as
president. </p>
<p>China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move
“seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the U.S. to
“engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.” </p>
<p>Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European
Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would “respond
firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes
tariffs.”</p>

id="beyoncé-wins-album-of-the-year-at-the-2025-grammys-for-cowboy-carter">Beyoncé
wins album of the year at the 2025 Grammys for ‘Cowboy Carter’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Beyoncé won album of the year for “Cowboy Carter” at
Sunday’s Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top
award.</p>
<p>The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in
Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many
feel she has been snubbed by its top honors.</p>
<p>In winning album of the year with “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé has become
the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last
was Lauryn Hill with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” 26 years ago.
Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is
only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys.</p>
<p>Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the
trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires
that burned thousands of homes.</p>
<p>“It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to
dedicate this to Ms. Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the
performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole
Opry.</p>
<p>“We finally saw it happen, everyone,” host Trevor Noah said, nodding
to the long overdue achievement for one of music’s transcendent
artists.</p>
<p>Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track
“Not Like Us,” taking home two of the night’s most prestigious
awards.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna dedicate this one to the city,” Lamar said before
shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The
first was Childish Gambino’s “This Is America.”</p>
<p>The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry</p>
<p>The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy
Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, “Cry For Me” and
“Timeless” with Playboi Carti.</p>
<p>His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording
Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said
in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys
organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: “The Grammys
remain corrupt.”</p>
<p>It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell
Roan was named best new artist.</p>
<p>She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels
and the music industry, instructing them to “offer a living wage and
healthcare, especially to developing artists.” She described getting
signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during
COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to
treat artists like “valuable employees.”</p>
<p>“Labels, we got you,” she concluded her speech. “But do you got
us?”</p>
<p>Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme</p>
<p>In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift
presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the
first Black woman to ever win in the category.</p>
<p>“Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists,” she said
in her speech. “I’m still in shock. Thank you so much for this
honor.”</p>
<p>Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee.</p>
<p>A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan
brought a rocking version of her “Pink Pony Club” to the Grammy stage.
Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant
pink horse.</p>
<p>Los Angeles on the mind</p>
<p>In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put
the spotlight on the city’s resiliency.</p>
<p>Noah’s opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires,
promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also
celebrates “the city that brought us so much of that music.” The Grammys
have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by
the fires.</p>
<p>As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had
contributed $7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far.</p>
<p>On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA
born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas
performed her hit “Birds of a Feather.” It was one of a number of ways
the show seeks to salute the city. “We love you LA,” she told the crowd
at the end of the set.</p>
<p>The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy
Newman’s “I Love L.A.” by Dawes — whose members were directly affected
by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow,
Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Star studded performances and victories</p>
<p>The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for
“Alligator Bites Never Heal.”</p>
<p>The tears were immediate. “This category was introduced in 1989. Two
women have won, Lauryn Hill —” she said, correcting herself. “Three
women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.”</p>
<p>Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary
producer Quincy Jones. “In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but
I have to say he changed mine forever,” he said. “You probably wouldn’t
even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones.”</p>
<p>Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo,
accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the “Wicked” star sang Frank
Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob
Collier with “Let the Good Times Roll,” followed by Stevie Wonder and
Hancock busting out “Bluesette” and “We Are The World.” For the latter,
they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in
the LA-area fires.</p>
<p>Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of “Don’t Stop ’Til
You Get Enough,” channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an
effortless moonwalk.</p>
<p>The Beatles’ “Now and Then,” which used AI technology, took home best
rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father
John Lennon. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the best band of all time,”
he said of the Beatles.</p>
<p>First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan,
Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin
León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra
Ferrell.</p>
<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the
crowd in a short singalong of their hit “Under the Bridge,” reminding
the crowd to “support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their
lives,” said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award
to Carpenter for “Short n’ Sweet.”</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t expecting this,” she said. “This is, woo, my first
Grammy so I’m going to cry.” (She’s now won two, but the earlier award
was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.)
She also performed.</p>
<p>Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense
political climate</p>
<p>Shakira won Latin pop album for “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” and gave a
powerful, short speech. “I want to dedicate this award to all my
immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of “California
Dreamin’.” Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop
duo/group performance for “Die With A Smile.”</p>
<p>“Trans people are not invisible. … The queer community deserves to be
lifted up,” Gaga said in her speech.</p>
<p>Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award “DEI is not a
threat, it’s a gift,” she said in her speech, referencing diversity,
equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the
U.S. government and several major corporations.</p>

id="fbi-staff-ordered-to-reveal-their-roles-in-jan.-6-capitol-riot-probes-by-monday">FBI
staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by
Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed
list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases
related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of
President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of
firings at the law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>“I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of
questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,” Chad
Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division
at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees
to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6
investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations.
Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on
Monday</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior
FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami
and Washington, D.C., field offices.</p>
<p>Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by
Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee
who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a
criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas
group in connection with the Gaza war.</p>
<p>Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department
prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought
by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken
to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving
classified government documents.</p>
<p>A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Democrats and other critics have said Trump’s team is carrying out a
purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the
criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters.</p>
<p>On Trump’s first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the
sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and
pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law
enforcement officers.</p>
<p>Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff
announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request
“encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have
supported these investigative efforts.”</p>
<p>“I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert]
Kissane,” Driscoll noted.</p>
<p>Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails
seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James
Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office,
made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday
amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents
Association email seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>“Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as
good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being
targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI
policy,” Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and
Kissane for “fighting for this organization.”</p>
<p>Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in
Bove’s memo, “NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this
time.”</p>

<h2 id="late-president-jimmy-carter-wins-posthumous-grammy">Late
President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous
Grammy award. </p>
<p>Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the
Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to
his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and
storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for “Last Sundays in
Plains: A Centennial Celebration,” recordings from his final Sunday
School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia.
Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on
the record. </p>
<p>It’s Carter’s fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three
previous ones for spoken word album. </p>
<p>If the former president won before his death, he would’ve become the
oldest Grammy award winner in history. </p>
<p>Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his
behalf. “Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the
world is truly remarkable,” he said in an acceptance speech. “Thank you
to the academy.” </p>
<p>In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George
Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. </p>
<p>If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first
Grammy win in 38 years. </p>
<p>Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop
Perkins in 2011.</p>

Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous
waste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a
rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San
Gabriel Valley, she said. </p>
<p>Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires,
she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to
process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts
here, where we have children,” said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23
years and former local school board member. </p>
<p>“We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous
materials,” she said. “Parents are absolutely concerned.” </p>
<p>Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities
opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of Lario Park in
Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport
potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. </p>
<p>In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian
trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste
that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. </p>
<p>The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars
and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the
enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous
materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints,
pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and
lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when
burned. </p>
<p>“The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of
creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately
impacted by pollution,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said
in a statement. </p>
<p>The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to
higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other
areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment. </p>
<p>Experts acknowledge residents’ concerns, but say hazardous waste is
not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the
waste is not stored on site for years. </p>
<p>Residents have questions about waste site </p>
<p>At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local
mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was
the site chosen? Why weren’t we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic
waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our
communities? What testing will be done after it’s closed? </p>
<p>Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and
spilled into the hall. They shouted “Shut it down!” and chanted “Leave
it in Altadena!” </p>
<p>EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer
to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations,
including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose
the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was
available. </p>
<p>She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the
state. </p>
<p>“We did the exact same thing” for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa
fires, Fitzgerald said, and “we did not have any impacts to the
community during the entire process.” </p>
<p>But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they
torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an
Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage
consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. </p>
<p>EPA says protective measures being taken </p>
<p>The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water
trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. </p>
<p>The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and
uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste
will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can
travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the
county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less
than six months, and more areas are being considered. </p>
<p>With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater
contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a
UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and
soil. </p>
<p>“There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through,
and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,” Mohanty
said. “And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into
the soil in a short time.” </p>
<p>The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust
emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. </p>
<p>Residents should stay vigilant </p>
<p>Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and
remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal
officials. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind
our backs,” she said. </p>
<p>While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what
is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about
emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael
Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and
Environmental Health. </p>
<p>“The community has the right to know that information from the EPA
and the Army Corps,” Jones said. </p>
<p>Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable
for ensuring safety. </p>
<p>“Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to
fight to not have it here,” she said of the site. “But the fact is, it’s
here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our
students, the concerns of our families.”</p>

recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks
meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard. </p>
<p>Gerber announced Friday that it was recalling and discontinuing its
brand of “Sooth N Chew” teething sticks after receiving customer
complaints about choking. The company said one emergency room visit had
been reported. </p>
<p>The teething sticks are edible teethers marketed to parents and
guardians of children six months and older. They come in
strawberry-apple and banana flavors. </p>
<p>Gerber said it was working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
on the recall. </p>
<p>Customers who bought the teething sticks should return them to stores
where they were purchased for a refund, the company said. </p>
<p>Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health
care provider. For any additional support needed, Gerber is available
24/7 at 1-800-4-GERBER (1-800-443-7237). </p>
<p>The company says it is working with the U.S. FDA on this recall and
will cooperate with them fully.</p>

<h2 id="new-orleans-super-bowl-gets-beefed-up-security-measures">New
Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year’s Day attack struck at the
heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are
confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super
Bowl.</p>
<p>Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy
beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists
including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash
between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the
Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season’s NFL champion.</p>
<p>Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14
people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city’s
most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple
lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement
officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are
ready to play host.</p>
<p>“We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve
hosted previously,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. “We
know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.”</p>
<p>What will the security presence look like?</p>
<p>Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will
be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy
Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about
details.</p>
<p>Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New
Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight
restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal
Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city’s
transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and
guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in
charge with the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
<p>Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the
stadium, said the Homeland Security Department’s Eric DeLaune, who is
leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.</p>
<p>Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in
rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and
across the city’s historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune
said.</p>
<p>No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the
Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting
down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter
will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray
machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are
engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters
(400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000
seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.</p>
<p>“They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure
it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,”
DeLaune said.</p>
<p>How the New Year’s Day attack has changed security plans</p>
<p>Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon
Street’s vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the
Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove
his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed
into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.</p>
<p>The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle
traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at
the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super
Bowl, officials said.</p>
<p>Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers
to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard
system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.</p>
<p>The NFL and federal and city agencies have “put a fresh set of eyes”
on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police
Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William
Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.</p>
<p>“No specific or credible threats” have surfaced targeting the Super
Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an “enhanced
security zone” along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and
said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.</p>
<p>After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing
undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter,
Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and
ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street
zone during the Super Bowl weekend.</p>
<p>But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless
concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State
Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from
bars.</p>
<p>AI and mobile apps will play security role</p>
<p>The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based
artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging
threats in real time.</p>
<p>The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data
across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic
cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.  </p>
<p>“It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get
a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,” Crowley said.
“The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better
action.”</p>

<h2
id="of-67-victims-of-air-disaster-near-washington-recovered-and-identified-officials-say">55
of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified,
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the
67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.</p>
<p>Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news
conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims
and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare
to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning.</p>
<p>“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us
all going,” said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to
a hangar for further investigation.</p>
<p>They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site
just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac
River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones.</p>
<p>Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where
an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided
Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators
were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while
recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave
federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.</p>
<p>But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on
morning TV news programs.</p>
<p>“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The
position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the
pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on
CNN.</p>
<p>The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to
land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a
training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged
into the Potomac River after colliding.</p>
<p>The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the
2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group
of hunters returning from a guided trip.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief
Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and
Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the
helicopter.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that
preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the
airliner and the Army helicopter.</p>
<p>Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s
flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say
whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an
evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.</p>
<p>Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters,
plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB
officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the
Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in
the area.</p>
<p>The discrepancy has yet to be explained.</p>
<p>Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data
from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve
because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the
Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be
less reliable.</p>
<p>“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” NTSB member Todd Inman
said.</p>
<p>“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice
Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard
to gather this data.”</p>
<p>Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments
before the crash.</p>
<p>“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data
recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of
impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the
recording.”</p>
<p>Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though
investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.</p>
<p>Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since
the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.</p>
<p>“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman
said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want
to give them answers.”</p>
<p>More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a
given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed
to lift heavy wreckage.</p>
<p>On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration
was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.</p>
<p>Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of
the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller,
a supervisor and supervisor in training.</p>
<p>According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one
controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those
duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically
combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the
tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not
normal.”</p>
<p>“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem
for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald
Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart,
brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.”</p>
<p>With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in
Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a
child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person
on the ground.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around
Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army
helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.</p>
<p>“It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too
complicated to understand, is it???” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001,
when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City
borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash
killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.</p>
<p>Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe,
but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the
most experienced pilots.</p>

USAID staff ousted as Trump administration dismantles aid agency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration removed two top security
officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the
weekend after they tried to stop representatives from billionaire Elon
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from gaining access to
restricted parts of the building, three sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The action added to the dozens of staff at USAID being removed from
their positions, as President Donald Trump’s team moves to abolish the
agency’s independence and possibly bring it under the control of the
State Department.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 career staff in the agency’s Legislative and Public Affairs
bureau lost access overnight to their emails, at least five sources
said, bringing the total number of senior USAID career staff who have
been put on leave over the past week close to 100.</p>
<p>“DOGE did access the building yesterday,” a senior Senate Democratic
aide said, requesting anonymity to discuss the incident. USAID security
officers tried to turn away DOGE personnel without security
clearances.</p>
<p>“They (security personnel) were threatened with action by the federal
Marshals Service,” the aide said. Following the incident, the director
of USAID security John Voorhees and his deputy were removed from their
positions and put on leave, sources said.</p>
<p>The purge follows more than a week of changes inside USAID,
Washington’s primary agency funding billions of dollars’ worth of
life-saving aid globally. Trump ordered a freeze on almost all U.S.
foreign aid, saying his administration will review spending to ensure
money is distributed in line with his “America First” foreign
policy.</p>
<p>Members of the group from DOGE were allowed to access several secure
spaces, including the office of security and the agency’s executive
secretariat.</p>
<p>There was no record of what information DOGE officials were able to
obtain in those areas, but the offices they accessed included classified
files and personal information about Americans who work at USAID, the
sources said.</p>
<p>Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, said on social media platform X
that no classified material was accessed without proper security
clearances.</p>
<p>Matt Hopson, who was appointed as chief of staff by the Trump
administration, has resigned, five sources familiar with the matter
said. A congressional source said his resignation followed the incident
with DOGE officials. USAID did not respond to a request about
Hopson.</p>
<p>CNN was first to report the incident between USAID and DOGE
officials.</p>
<p>Legal battle looms</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats said the changes appeared to violate U.S.
laws establishing USAID and funding it as a separate agency. Two senior
Senate Democratic aides said lawmakers and staff had been meeting on
Sunday and would meet again on Monday to consider further steps,
including legal action.</p>
<p>Senior Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
including its chair Jeanne Shaheen, on Sunday sent a letter to U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeking an explanation over the incident.
Shaheen said that she was working to gather Democrats and Republicans to
ask for answers.</p>
<p>The global freeze on most of U.S. foreign aid is already sending
shockwaves around the world. Field hospitals in Thai refugee camps,
landmine clearance in war zones, and drugs to treat millions suffering
from diseases such as HIV are among the programs at risk of
elimination.</p>
<p>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Brian Mast on Sunday said
that he would support moving USAID under the State Department and that
there needs to be “more command and control.’</p>
<p>Asked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” if congressional approval was needed
or whether Trump could act unilaterally, Mast did not answer. The
“purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies” and
freezing aid were “all very important and necessary steps to make sure
that we secure America,” he said.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID did not respond to requests for
comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, billionaire Trump ally Musk on Sunday continued to slam
USAID in his posts and reposts on his X social network. Trump has
assigned Musk to lead a federal cost-cutting panel with broad oversight
powers. Officials from DOGE have made frequent visits to USAID
headquarters in Washington, according to sources familiar with the
matter.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Musk accused USAID of being “a criminal organization”
without providing any evidence and added “Time for it to die”.</p>
<p>Peter Marocco was appointed as head of the Office of Foreign
Assistance at the State Department and is leading the agency’s sweeping
changes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Marocco
previously served in Trump’s first administration in the Department of
Defense. The State Department did not respond to questions about
Marocco.</p>
<p>USAID’s website has been down since Saturday afternoon, a sign that
the end is near for the agency, whose funding goes to programs on
everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean
water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption
work.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>At a Washington event marking Uzbekistan’s 33rd Armed Forces Day,
held at Uzbekistan’s Embassy, Uzbek and U.S. officials — both civilian
and military — recognized each other for fostering a strong relationship
and maintaining close cooperation in defense and security, particularly
in areas such as Afghanistan and regional stability.</p>
<p>Most of the American planes and helicopters flown to Uzbekistan by
Afghan pilots who fled the Taliban in August 2021 were later donated to
the country. Seven of the assets the Pentagon deemed suitable, including
Black Hawk helicopters, have now been returned to the United States,
officials confirmed.</p>

id="in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather">In
US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow
Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted
handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler’s Knob in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Phil was welcomed with chants of “Phil, Phil, Phil,” and pulled from
a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted:
“Only I know — you can’t trust A.I.”</p>
<p>The woodchuck’s weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back
more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in
European folklore, but it took Bill Murray’s 1993 “Groundhog Day” movie
to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of
revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States
and beyond.</p>
<p>When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to
usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more
weeks of winter.</p>
<p>The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music
that ranged from the Ramones to “Pennsylvania Polka” as they awaited
sunrise and Phil’s emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected
officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at
the scene.</p>
<p>Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended
the event for 33 years. “I like the cold, you know, and this is probably
the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,” Lovitch said
in Punxsutawney. “And it’s just a really good time.”</p>
<p>Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early
spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less
than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is
subjective.</p>
<p>Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there
are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler’s Knob: the
faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to
confirm their skepticism.</p>
<p>Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through “Groundhog-ese” with
the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club’s
leader. It’s not as if he speaks in English words. “He’ll like wink,
he’ll purr, he’ll chatter, he’ll — you know — nod,” Dunkel said.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6
kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction
was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports
mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.</p>
<p>Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the “Groundhog Day”
movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to
make the trip from Ohio to witness the event.</p>
<p>“We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we’re here,” Post said.
“We’re doing it.”</p>
<p>A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on
an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split
time between Gobbler’s Knob and Phil’s longtime home at the town
library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful
speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the
proceedings.</p>
<p>“It’s a holiday where you don’t really owe anyone anything,” said
A.J. Dereume, who among the club’s 15-member inner circle serves as
Phil’s handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. “You’re
grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that’s just fun to
believe in.”</p>
<p>Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first
time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were
ready for the subfreezing temperatures. “It’s once in a lifetime — we’re
probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,” said
Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was
made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the
crowd.</p>
<p>Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring,
Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the
big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily
visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The
club’s lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing
weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an “elixir of life”
that keeps him immortal. “There’s only one Phil, and it’s not something
that can be handed down,” Dunkel said. “Just like Santa Claus and the
Easter Bunny, there’s only one.”</p>
<p>Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in
many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been
Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian
provinces.</p>

id="beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sundays-grammys">Beyonce
competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday’s Grammys</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on
Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while
acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the
industry. </p>
<p>Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year
with her country record “Cowboy Carter.” The superstar singer has never
won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any
other musician. </p>
<p>Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift
for “The Tortured Poets Department” and Billie Eilish for “Hit Me Hard
and Soft.” </p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET
(0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part
awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the
recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those
who lost homes in the disaster. </p>
<p>“It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I’m starting to think
they’re going to be able to do it,” said Paul Grein, awards editor at
music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, “people can
take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through
that.” </p>
<p>Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter,
Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night’s scheduled performers.
The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music
producer who died in November. </p>
<p>At last year’s Grammys, Beyonce’s husband and rapper Jay-Z argued
that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including
his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters,
producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys
than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own
metrics, that doesn’t work,” Jay-Z said on stage. </p>
<p>“Cowboy Carter” was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and
homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music
and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1
on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last
spring. </p>
<p>The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country
Music Awards in their nominations in September. </p>
<p>The “Cowboy Carter” nomination is Beyonce’s fifth entry in the album
of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times,
including last year for “Midnights.” </p>
<p>Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by
Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven
nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of
the night’s awards. </p>
<p>Beyonce’s other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for
single “Texas Hold ’Em.” </p>
<p>Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are
Eilish for “Birds of a Feather,” Carpenter for “Please Please Please”
and Roan for “Good Luck, Babe!” </p>
<p>In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter’s “Espresso” and
Swift’s duet with Post Malone, “Fortnight.”</p>

id="artists-help-fellow-creators-who-lost-works-archives-in-l.a.-fires">Artists
help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be
the last time he’d step inside his safe haven. </p>
<p>The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in
the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were
prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. </p>
<p>“I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get
damaged, and I’ll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it
up,” said the rapper. </p>
<p>But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that
thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash,
destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and
Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county,
they are known hubs for many of the city’s creative community, housing
filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. </p>
<p>“L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that
were destroyed,” said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping
artists recover. “So many members of our community lost everything. They
lost all their artworks and their archives - that’s irreplaceable, a
lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.” </p>
<p>“A lot of my collectors lost their homes,” said figurative and
conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three
years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize
as a result of the wildfire. “Before the fire, I was in talks with
certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they’re not in a good
place to talk. I’m hoping that there’s support so that the art scene can
still thrive. But it’s going to be tough.” </p>
<p>Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business
opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional
archives, adding to their emotional burden. </p>
<p>Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had
planned to digitize for an upcoming book. </p>
<p>“Everything’s gone,” Obi said. “All of my stuff that is related to
Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode
of it.” </p>
<p>Grief and Hope </p>
<p>Kathryn Andrews never imagined she’d experience another wildfire in
her lifetime. </p>
<p>The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades
neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she’s had
to escape a wildfire. </p>
<p>She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which
burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. </p>
<p>“I’ve already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a
different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached
to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture,
thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live
in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,” she
said. </p>
<p>Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims
to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and
was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals
and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V.
Hendrickson. </p>
<p>“Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever
the most emergent need is,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a
Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their
new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday,
Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said
the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for
artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort
will continue fundraising until mid-March. </p>
<p>Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing
peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and
renter’s issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their
creative community. </p>
<p>“These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in
their work, including the five of us, towards building community and
building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and
beyond,” said Pittman. </p>
<p>For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists
throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and
housing. </p>
<p>Long road ahead </p>
<p>For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant
losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as “a
pocket of heaven.” </p>
<p>“I didn’t want to leave,” said Wong, who safely evacuated with her
husband and 2-year-old daughter. “We were just so in love with this
house, and it wasn’t just my house. It was also my studio space.” </p>
<p>Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts.
Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern
California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies,
professional equipment for creatives and more. </p>
<p>“I’m applying to everything,” said Obi, who needs to replace his
instruments and recording equipment. </p>
<p>Wong said she’s received much support from family, friends and
colleagues. </p>
<p>“I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back
into shooting,” she said. “I got to get all my gear back, too. It’s
going to be a long road, but it’ll be OK.” </p>
<p>Arts scene rebirth </p>
<p>Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he
believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed
infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. </p>
<p>“Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it’s
going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and
everything else,” said Dunleavy. “I’ve been so impressed with the amount
of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to
help with this. … I hope that continues into the coming years.” </p>
<p>Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists
and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects
throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. </p>
<p>“Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in
Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to
absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in
Los Angeles … and urge people to shoot productions here,” she said. </p>
<p>Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los
Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling
donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with
displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. </p>
<p>Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this
work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of
nonprofit work for the community. </p>
<p>“All of our wheels are turning now that we’ve seen the power that
just self-organizing can have.”</p>

<h2 id="trumps-tariffs-are-a-warning">Trump’s Tariffs Are a Warning</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjEzMDUzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTcwMTExNX0.gi2v93PbaOvqwiIHIvfQTueBFmFeeHif9CaHF1MbqrI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Saturday evening, President Donald Trump signed orders placing 25%
tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a lower, 10%
tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas, uranium, and other energy sources.
</p>
<p>
Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on all goods imported from China.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, giving Trump — who revels in
proposing tariffs but has shown some reluctance to impose them for real
— another 48 hours to maneuver. But if the new tariffs do actually bite,
then they will affect nearly half of America’s imports and reshape some
of the world’s most important energy and trading relationships.
</p>
<p>
Every day, millions of barrels of oil and cubic feet of natural gas flow
across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico borders. The three countries have
developed an integrated and harmonized network of pipelines, storage
tanks, and refineries that has helped turn the United States into the
world’s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will almost inevitably disrupt that relationship. They may
also upset the millions of dollars’ worth of electricity that shuttles
from Canada to the United States every day across their shared power
grids.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will prove economically painful, although just how damaging
is hard to know in advance. They could shrink the United States’ GDP by
0.4%, while increasing taxes by $830 per household, according to
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> by the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank.
Another estimate from
<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Budget Lab at Yale</u></a> says that the tariffs could push up the
personal consumption expenditures price index — the Fed’s chosen
inflation gauge — by 0.75%, reducing the average household’s purchasing
power by $1,200 over the course of a year.

These costs could worsen as Mexico, Canada, and China raise their own
tariffs or trade barriers in retaliation. Late on Saturday, Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would impose its own 25%
tariffs on CA$155 billion of goods imported from the United States.
</p>
<p>
The economic hit to the U.S. economy could also be much larger than
estimated if some manufacturers respond to higher costs not by hiking
prices, but rather by delaying or shutting down production.
</p>
<p>
We’ve been reporting on the economic impact of these tariffs at Heatmap
over the past week, documenting their potential impacts for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>oil
refineries</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/canada-tariffs-electricity" target="_self"><u>the
electricity grid</u></a>. But now that the details are here, a few
things stand out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>First, the tariffs on China are qualitatively different from the
tariffs on our North American neighbors — especially Canada.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Chinese tariffs are not new. Trump engaged China in a trade war during
his first term and ultimately reached a handshake agreement, although he
has since said that China did not buy enough American agricultural
products to keep up its end of the bargain. Some of the tariffs Trump
placed on Chinese imports last time — including eye-watering levies on
solar panels — remain in effect; the new 10% tariff will be added to
those figures.
</p>
<p>
What did <em><em>not </em></em>happen last time was a serious,
out-and-out trade war with Canada and Mexico, America’s neighbors and
biggest trading partners. Although Trump entertained the possibility of
Mexican tariffs during the campaign, he did not propose tariffs on
Canadian imports until after his November election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Second, the tariffs are
</strong><em><strong><em>quantitatively</em></strong></em><strong>
different, too.</strong> The president has not yet explained why he has
placed higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico, who are our allies, than on
China, which is our economic frenemy at best and our geostrategic
adversary at worst. During the campaign, Trump sometimes proposed a
“universal tariff” of 10% to 20% on all American imported goods,
regardless of their country of origin. That proposed universal tariff —
which was seen by some analysts as an extreme and unlikely proposal —
was at a<em><em> lower </em></em>rate than what he is now levying on
North American imports.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third, this trade war has apparently been concocted and planned
much more haphazardly than the one during Trump’s first term.</strong>
Last time, the U.S. was careful to exempt electronics — iPhones,
laptops, Xboxes — from its levies, as well as other consumer products.
These tariffs do not do so, at least not yet. Nor do they exempt certain
minerals that are essential to manufacturing electric vehicle batteries
or other high-end electronics. (<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>has reported
that as recently as Friday, Tesla
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/tesla-fights-tariffs-on-ev-graphite-putting-musk-at-odds-with-trump" target="_blank"><u>was
lobbying</u></a> for an exemption for graphite, a mineral crucial to
making EV anodes.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finally, what is so striking about these tariffs is how they
will be good for almost nobody.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt the American oil industry. As I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-canada-oil-tariffs" target="_self"><u>wrote
earlier this week</u></a>, U.S. energy companies have spent tens of
billions of dollars on special equipment that can refine the sludgy,
sulfurous crude oil extracted in Canada; Canadian companies, in turn,
have sold us that crude oil at a discount and built infrastructure so
that it can be used by the United States.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt oil refineries. The U.S. refines
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62624#:~:text=U.S.%20refining%20capacity%20increased%20this,with%20the%20start%20of%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
18 million barrels of oil</u></a> a day, but it extracts — even today,
around
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
all-time high</u></a> — only
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63824#:~:text=An%20average%20of%2013.4%20million,has%20maintained%20each%20year%20since." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>13.5
million barrels</u></a> a day. Most of the difference between what it
refines and what it extracts is made up by heavy crude from Canada and
Mexico, which blends well with the lighter petroleum produced by U.S.
fracking wells. By raising the cost of Canadian and Mexican fuel
imports, the cost of all refined products will rise.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who buys gasoline in the Midwest and
Mountain West, where Canadian oil plays a much larger role in local
markets. They will hurt diesel and jet fuel prices in those regions too.
</p>
<p>
But the damage will not be limited to the fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who uses electricity across the parts of
the country, especially the Northeast, that import large amounts of
electricity from Canada’s roaring hydroelectric plants.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt home builders and construction companies because
the United States gets its best building-grade lumber from Canada. That
lumber — already made more expensive
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/why-climate-change-pushing-lumber-prices/621288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
a climate change-intensified supply crisis</u></a> — will now face
additional taxes at the border.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs will hurt anyone who wants to buy or rent a home in the
United States because the lack of lumber will worsen the housing
shortage and general affordability crisis.
</p>
<p>
They will hurt automakers, who in the past three decades have
constructed sophisticated supply chains spanning North America — a
logistical dance that allows a single vehicle’s components and parts to
cross the U.S., Canadian, and Mexico borders many times on their way to
becoming a final product. They will hurt autoworkers, who depend on that
supply chain. They will even hurt car dealerships, who will respond to
higher prices by selling less inventory.
</p>
<p>
If the dollar rises to accommodate the new tariff level, as some White
House officials have argued, then the tariffs will hurt <em><em>all
</em></em>U.S. domestic manufacturers because their products will become
more expensive, and therefore less competitive on the global market.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying, to be clear, that these tariffs are an economic
catastrophe. We don’t actually know their economic cost yet — perhaps it
will be minimal. But even then, they will still be a stupid waste of
money that will help nobody, and which will make the U.S. economy
neither more complex nor more secure.
</p>
<p>
The tariffs are a warning. As recently as last week, Goldman Sachs
analysts
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pkrugman.bsky.social/post/3lh5rc7we2c2i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
the risk of tariffs</u></a> at only a 20% chance of actually happening.
They ignored what Trump had said<em> </em>he would do because it struck
them as too implausible, too unwise, too patently harmful. Perhaps in
the next two days they will be proven right. But Trump has begun to
blather about many unwise and harmful ideas — invading Panama (where
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is headed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/rubio-panama-canal-trump.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>right
now</u></a>), annexing Greenland, making Canada (somehow) the 51st
state. Many seem even more implausible than these tariffs, and yet
Donald Trump says that he wants to do them, too. How much longer can
Republican lawmakers and business leaders pretend that he doesn’t mean
what he says? The chance of calamity has only just begun.

says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – the world’s
leading HIV initiative – was covered by a waiver for life-saving
humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid.</p>
<p>Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump
ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see
if they align with his “America First” foreign policy. The U.S. is the
world’s largest aid donor.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for
emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical
services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of
detail in Trump’s order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups
confused as to whether their work can continue.</p>
<p>So, Saturday the State Department’s Bureau of Global Health Security
and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was
covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were
allowed.</p>
<p>These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including
testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including
tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain
for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child
transmission services.</p>
<p>“Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may
not be resumed without express approval,” it said.</p>
<p>More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds
of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are
directly supported by PEPFAR.</p>
<p>Under Trump’s foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time
since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according
to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week
a total of $545 million.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID
of its independence and put it under State Department control, two
sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a
significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.</p>
