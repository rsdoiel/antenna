      <h1>New Orleans braces for Trump’s immigration crackdown: ‘We have rights’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>As many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on the city imminently – despite falling crime</p>
<p>New Orleanians are bracing for a major deployment of US border patrol officers to the city, as Donald Trump forges on with his mass deportation agenda and sweeping federal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration crackdown</a> in Democrat-led cities.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://nopdnews.com/post/may-2025/nopd-reports-continued-significant-decrease-in-vio/">falling crime</a>, as many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on New Orleans imminently to begin laying the groundwork for “Operation Swamp Sweep”, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-crackdown-new-orleans-55119a4cf4e6da418e38287cb20c0ef4">the Associated Press reported</a> is due to launch in south-east Louisiana and Mississippi on 1 December with the stated aim of arresting 5,000 people.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas’s 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> likely discriminated on the basis of race.</p>
<p>The order, signed by Justice Samuel Alito, will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map, which is favorable to Republicans, to be used in the midterm elections.</p>

      <h1>Chomsky had deeper ties with Epstein than previously known, documents reveal</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>The philosopher and the sex trafficker were in contact long after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, documents reveal</p>
<p>The prominent linguist and philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.</p>
<p>Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president">had previously claimed</a> to have with the latter.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The Maga star won on the Epstein files and could have founded a Republican resistance movement but is instead the latest dissenter to head for the exit</p>
<p>It has been a head-spinning 48 hours in Washington. Liberal TV host Rachel Maddow showed up at the funeral of conservative vice-president Dick Cheney. Donald <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/trump-mamdani-white-house-new-york">Trump embraced Zohran Mamdani</a>, a democratic socialist set to be the first Muslim mayor of New York, like a brother.</p>
<p>And then Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump acolyte-turned-nemesis who bested him over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, stunned the political establishment again. In what should have been her hour of triumph, the Maga star abruptly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns">announced that she was quitting</a> the House of Representatives.</p>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>Fox News and other conservative networks have mostly avoided covering the president’s ties to the sex trafficker</p>
<p>When House Democrats released emails which showed Jeffrey Epstein claiming Donald Trump “knew about the girls”, rightwing news channels in the US reacted the same way: with silence.</p>
<p>Viewers of Fox News and other conservative networks would have had no idea that the president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/jeffrey-epstein-new-emails-donald-trump">allegedly spent hours</a> at Epstein’s home with one of his victims. Rightwing media largely kept quiet on all of it, apart from <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/flustered-hannity-struggles-to-contain-guest-talking-trump-dementia-on-air/">a notable slip</a> when a progressive guest on Sean Hannity’s show repeatedly told his audience: “Trump’s all over the Epstein files.”</p>

      <h1>‘Horribly wrong’: US veterans condemn Trump’s politicization of military</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>Experts infuriated by president accusing Democrats of ‘sedition’ for urging soldiers to refuse illegal orders</p>
<p>Veterans have condemned the politicization of the military after Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">accused Democratic</a> lawmakers of “sedition, punishable by death” after a small group of them released a video in which they urged US soldiers not to follow any “unlawful” orders.</p>
<p>The extraordinary exchange was sparked after Democratic lawmakers with military or national security backgrounds – the Congressional representatives Maggie Goodlander, Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and the senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin – posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811">video</a> on Facebook addressed to US service members.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A pension-pot World Cup looms and with Trump in the White House and a crown prince at his back, it is now a safe space</p>
<p>It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi">state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman</a> and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.</p>
<p>Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.</p>

<p>The British driver’s march to the title looks increasingly likely with pole at what has been a bogey circuit for McLaren.</p>
<p>Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.</p>

      <p>TJX, the parent company of off-price retailers T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, posted excellent earnings this week, while Target cut its sales forecast. “Off-price” means TJX sells excess inventory at a discount, which may be more attractive to increasingly stressed shoppers hunting for deals. Also in this episode: Political affiliation colors consumer sentiment, USDA cuts end a major revenue stream for small-scale farmers, and supply chains are unusually slow this holiday season.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The president hosted the mayor-elect at the White House – and seemed enamoured of his fellow New Yorker</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Oval Office meeting between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> – the mayor-elect of New York City, the US president’s beloved home town – was hardly the combustible tête-à-tête many had predicted. For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together.</p>
<p>Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “ <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157">100% Communist Lunatic</a>” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In turn, Mamdani had assailed Trump as a “despot” and pledged to be the president’s “ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trumps-worst-nightmare-mamdani-targets-the-president-in-his-general-election-bid-00504123">worst nightmare</a>”.

He continued: “I’m not going to get into my specific security arrangements, but it would be irresponsible for me not to consider that [Trump’s] words result in increased threats to myself, even to my staff, to my family.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled release of October’s consumer price index, citing the government shutdown</p>
<p>The US federal government will not publish official data on inflation for October, depriving policymakers at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> of key information as they consider whether to cut interest rates.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the release of the closely watched consumer price index (CPI) for October, citing the government shutdown – the longest in history, before it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">ended earlier this month</a> – and stating it could not “retroactively collect” the data required for the report.</p>

      <h1>New Mexico now offers free childcare for all. Here’s how parents and teachers made it happen</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>From marches and petitions to a constitutional amendment, a years-long campaign led to New Mexico becoming the first state in the US to offer universal childcare</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/people-in-the-us-have-you-gotten-involved-in-community-organizing-this-year">People in the US: Have you gotten involved in activism or community organizing this year?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay. Although she taught, cooked, cleaned and did the books for a small childcare center, she was earning minimum wage. A classmate at the local community college had suggested Ibarra attend the rally, and stick around afterward for a meal with Olé, a grassroots non-profit committed to organizing working-class families.</p>

      <h1>The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1</p>
<p>The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.</p>

<p>The health of Rodney Taylor, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/liberia">Liberian</a>-born man who is a double amputee and is missing three fingers on one hand, has continued to worsen after being picked up by ICE and detained at Georgia’s Stewart immigration detention center and his case has now garnered support from a US senator.</p>
<p>Taylor, who has been detained for almost a year, told the Guardian he has now been diagnosed with bone spurs in his back, causing severe pain, while the silicone lining of one of his prosthetic legs has deteriorated, causing chafing and boils.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts say files certain to contain revelations but warn disclosures could still leave critical questions unanswered</p>
<p>They are the files that America – and the world – has long waited to see: a huge cache of documents at the Department of Justice related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/judge-calls-jeffrey-epstein-most-infamous-pedophile-in-american-history-as-he-releases-transcripts/">whom a judge</a> once dubbed the “most infamous pedophile in American history”.</p>
<p>After a law passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday, those documents must now must be released to the American public and a waiting army of journalists. Just like previous Epstein caches they are certain to include damning communications between Epstein and many rich and powerful people in his social circle.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has alleged that two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> men plotted a murderous coup d’etat on the island of Gonâve, the largest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti">Haiti</a>, “for the purpose of carrying out their rape fantasies”.</p>
<p>The two men, 21-year-old Gavin Rivers Weisenburg and 20-year-old Tanner Christopher Thomas, have been accused of plotting to take the island by force, utilizing the homeless population of Washington DC, then killing all the men on the island and “using the women and children as sex slaves”, according to an announcement by the US attorney’s office of the eastern district of Texas on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Plus Vanity Fair’s plucky decision to feature only men in its Hollywood Issue and the reporter fired after RFK Jr ‘sexting scandal’</p>
<p>We’ve all said things that didn’t come out right, and it’s my instinct – stand by for some counter-intuition! – that Donald Trump’s “quiet, piggy” admonishment of a female reporter on Air Force One this week was a very weird attempt at affection, or possibly flirtation. As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">expressed outrage</a> after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.</p>
<p><strong>What did the lawmakers say in the video?</strong> “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”</p>
<p><strong>What did the report say?</strong> A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.</p>
<p><strong>Where did it come from?</strong> The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/">Property of the People</a>, a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.</p>

      <h1>How ICE raids are disrupting D.C.'s economy</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>After months of ICE raids on the nation’s capital, some construction workers are afraid to go into Washington, D.C. for work, fearing arrest and deportation. Meanwhile, the contractors who need them are struggling to adapt. We'll check in on some of the businesses that are being most affected. But first: why markets ended yesterday on a sour note, and why the housing affordability crisis is accelerating fastest in rural areas.</p>

      <h1>Japan borrows heavily to stimulate its economy</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan's cabinet has approved a stimulus package worth more than $130 billion. It's the first major policy initiative of the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and aims to help households and companies with measures like energy subsidies and tax cuts. Then, the global climate change conference COP30 is drawing to a close in Brazil, and so far, there’s been no agreement on key issues like the fossil fuel phaseout.</p>

<p>The embattled former police chief of Vallejo, a San Francisco Bay Area city that has attracted <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/23/how-a-deadly-police-force-ruled-a-city">national attention</a> over police violence, has said that he endured a steady procession of racist remarks from colleagues and online harassment and threats that ultimately led him to resign.</p>
<p>By the time Chief Shawny Williams tendered his resignation in 2022, he said he had received a slew of threats – at his office, at his home, and in his email inbox. Most demanded he step down. But even after resigning, the threats still came by mail to his home and a second property he owned outside the state.</p>

</ul>
<p>Little went right for Josh Allen in a frustrating game Thursday night against the Houston Texans. And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.</p>
<p>Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.</p>

      <p>Karoline Leavitt says president ‘calls out fake news when he sees it’ after remark to reporter draws severe condemnation</p>
<p>The White House issued a full-throated defense of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s reference to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” on Thursday, claiming without evidence that the president “calls out fake news when he sees it and gets frustrated with reporters who spread false information”.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, made the remarks during a White House briefing, saying Trump was re-elected because of his bluntness and that members of the media should appreciate his willingness to answer their questions.</p>

<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has been changed to reflect the belief of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health and human services secretary, that there is a link between vaccines and autism, a view flatly contradicted by experts and scientifically validated studies.</p>
<p>Public health and autism specialists roundly condemned the alteration to the CDC’s “vaccine safety” webpage, after it was changed to read: “The statement ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim.”</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>The September jobs report finally arrived after a six-week delay, showing employers added 119,000 jobs — well above expectations. The BLS also recorded an unusually strong 80% employer response rate, the highest since 2019. Improved accuracy came as a consequence of the deferred report. Also in this episode: Food service gained 36,000 jobs, America’s brand image hit a new low, and a scholarship celebrated 20 years of supporting Latina students.</p>

      <p>Big-name drivers and cutting out the middle man a vital part of the strategy with just over 100 days to go before the 2026 season opener</p>
<p>Twelve months ago at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Cadillac were finally given the green light as Formula One’s newest entry for 2026. Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.</p>
<p>At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.</p>

<p>Hunt said in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s The Will Cain Show on Tuesday that she “most definitely” backs Turning Point’s counter-programming effort, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/charlie-erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-tpusa">Erika Kirk</a>, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to his <a href="https://time.com/5852446/bad-bunny-black-lives-matter/">criticism of Donald Trump</a> and US immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>Senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts has said that the next independent Department of Justice “should investigate” the private donations that have funded the construction of the new White House ballroom.</p>

<p>It's certainly not the first time U.S. President Donald Trump has insulted a female reporter, but calling Bloomberg's Catherine Lucey 'piggy' on Air Force One, then berating ABC News' Mary Bruce a few days later has raised questions about just how much journalists are expected to tolerate as they do their jobs.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After a month and a half delay due to the government shutdown, we are finally getting some official economic data. It is old (from September), but it's here. The economy gained 119,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate went up for the third month in a row. What's that mean for job seekers? Plus, declining consumer sentiment doesn't translate to declining consumer spending, Walmart's quarterly results beat expectations, and international student enrollment has dipped.</p>

      <h1>‘I lose my liberty in that moment’: Charlotte shuts down as citizens and noncitizens alike face ICE arrests</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>As federal agents descend in North Carolina, businesses close as even an after-school program is targeted</p>
<p>On Central Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, Manolo’s Bakery has become a focal point for resistance to the expanded immigration raids since border patrol officers descended on the city over the weekend. The owner closed the bakery to prevent his staff from being targeted. Most of the other shops on Charlotte’s busy immigrant-centric street followed suit.</p>
<p>Dozens of people have taken up camp in the parking lot to wave signs of support for immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) has been active in the city for months as part of Donald Trump’s mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">deportation agenda</a>, but things went up a level when the border patrol arrived. Agents swiftly began buzzing through the place to make an armed show of their presence, followed at times by Charlotteans honking their horns in warning.</p>

      <h1>AI to the rescue (for now)</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Nvidia reported earnings yesterday after markets closed, and it did not disappoint. Nvidia makes 90% of all chips used in AI. Tech stocks, including Nvidia, have been carrying a lot of weight in markets, and investors had started getting a little nervous about whether the AI boom was a bubble — but Nvidia's results have been pretty reassuring. Also: stale data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Japan's tensions with China.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: US and Russian officials draft plan to end Ukraine war based on capitulation from Kyiv</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>The plan, which is likely to be viewed as ‘surrender’ by Kyiv, is facing pushback from the EU. Plus, Trump signs bill to compel release of more Epstein documents</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine">quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine</a> that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.</p>
<p><strong>Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?</strong> That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.</p>
<p><strong>What has the EU said?</strong> Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15">follow our live blog here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What will the justice department actually release?</strong> All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.</p>

</ul>
<p>Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.</p>
<p>He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain</p>
<p>Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.</p>
<p>Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Wall Street was cheered last night by better-than-expected results from the chip giant Nvidia. But the AI boom continues to fuel fears of a market bubble. In the past few weeks, a growing number of the world’s leading figures in finance have suggested that AI stocks are unrealistically inflated in value. Plus, Meta says it's shutting down accounts for younger teenagers in Australia ahead of the country's social media ban for youths under 16.</p>

<p>Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367">10 million people to lose their health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.</p>

Both teams have won the NWSL Championship once before: the Spirit in 2021 and Gotham two years later. Washington are the likely favourites, but Gotham’s talent cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>As we look forward to Saturday night in San Jose, here are a few key battles that could decide the game.</p>

      <p>Experts fear plan, one of many attempts Trump’s made to dismantle wildlife protection, will speed up extinction crisis</p>
<p>The Trump administration presented a new plan to roll back regulations in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on Wednesday, a move experts fear will accelerate the extinction crisis if adopted.</p>

<p>Twelve months on, that lead has narrowed dramatically, according to opinion polls – and a challenger is attempting to build a “coalition of the pissed off” to overturn it altogether.</p>

<p>Senior White House officials have discussed internally their preference for Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros Discovery in recent weeks, and one official has discussed potential programming changes at CNN with Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount.</p>
<p>The discussions, according to people familiar with the matter, come as Paramount portrays itself as the best bid for Warner Bros Discovery, after the company announced last month it was open to offers, because it would have an easier time getting through regulatory review.</p>

      <h1>The difference between Grokipedia and Wikipedia</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Grokipedia, the AI-powered encyclopedia launched by Elon Musk's xAI last month, promises to be an ideological alternative to Wikipedia. But the tool doesn't just have a different political flavor, argues Ryan McGrady, senior fellow at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>He recently wrote, for Tech Policy Press, that Grokipedia takes a more top-down approach to knowledge, one that harks back to less democratized eras.</p>

      <p>Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick accused of funneling money to family healthcare business for 2021 congressional campaign</p>
<p>Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat who represents a Florida district in Congress, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/south-florida-congresswoman-charged-stealing-5-million-fema-funds-and-making-illegal">indicted by a federal grand jury</a> for allegedly funneling more than $5m worth of federal disaster funds from her company into her 2021 congressional campaign.</p>
<p>The indictment states that Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, stole $5m in Fema overpayments that their family healthcare company received, moving the money through multiple accounts to hide its origins. The indictment alleges that the majority of the money was used for Cherfilus-McCormick’s congressional campaign, as well as for the personal benefit of the defendants.</p>

      <p>
      <p>As the US president has flailed around looking for someone to shout at, it’s the media, his familiar old foe, which has drawn the sharpest attacks</p>

<p>“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,” Donald Trump claimed in 2016, “and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Coming two weeks before the Iowa caucus, it was an unusual message from a politician, but the last nine years have served to underscore the point.</p>
<p>His “Make America great again” base, and the bulk of the Republican party, stood with him through (deep breath): two impeachments, children in cages, “very fine people on both sides”, 34 felony convictions, an insurrection, “shithole countries”, attempting to overturn an election, hush money payments to an adult film actor, “they’re rapists”, a brutal immigration crackdown, Four Seasons Total Landscaping, “grab ‘em by the pussy”, billions of dollars made by the Trump family, cosying up to dictators, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-stares-into-the-sun-as-aide-screams-dont-look/#:~:text=Today%20President%20Trump%20stepped%20out,stared%20dumbly%20into%20the%20sun.">“don’t look!”</a>, mass pardons for his allies and friends, an unfinished wall, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-liberation-day-tariff-walk-back">“liberation day”</a>, presenting himself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king">as a king</a>, forcing <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/76/233676-050-34726587/American-businessman-Donald-Trump-Jr-2018.jpg?w=300">Donald Trump Jr</a> into the public consciousness, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/19/trump-emissions-policy-could-cause-climate-deaths">and more</a>.</p>
<p>Trump has responded to the insubordination in the ways he knows best: pettiness and cruelty.</p>

      <p>Sixteen submerged canoes discovered along Lake Mendota’s shore at a kind of prehistoric parking lot</p>
<p>Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a sort of prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday that archaeologists have mapped the location of 16 canoes submerged in the lake bed of Lake Mendota in Madison. Tamara Thomsen, the state’s maritime archaeologist, said the site lies near a network of what were once Indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.</p>

      <p>Officials are reportedly taking their time on US president’s long-promised chips plan to avoid a rupture with China</p>
<p>US officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</p>
<p>Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in the government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported.</p>

<p>The intensively discussed files related to the disgraced former financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein passed a significant milestone on Tuesday when Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of releasing them.</p>
<p>After months of deliberate delays and manoeuvres, the House of Representatives voted by 427 to one in favor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, legislation which would, if enacted, require the justice department to release all unclassified materials on Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The Senate has unanimously agreed to swiftly pass the bill, which would then head to the White House for Donald Trump’s signature.</p>

</ul>
<p>Major League Soccer announced on Wednesday that it is re-opening its investigation into Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The Union said in a statement to the Guardian that they have placed Tanner on administrative leave. The move comes a day after the Guardian published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/18/philadelphia-union-ernst-tanner-mls-investigation">an investigation into Tanner’s conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Tanner had previously been under investigation by MLS after the league received a complaint from the MLS Players Association in late January. In it, the MLSPA outlined a wide range of alleged issues surrounding Tanner, which included the use of racist, sexist and homophobic language and instances of inappropriate physical contact with a staff member.</p>
<p>Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”</p>
<p>Directed a homophobic slur at an MLS referee in 2023</p>
<p>Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”</p>
<p>Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.</p>
<p>Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.</p>

      <p>In a word: uncertainty. Retail chains like Target are pulling back on hiring temporary workers ahead of this year’s holiday shopping season as tariffs take their toll, consumer sentiment slumps, and little government data leaves them with little guidance. We’ll hear more. But first: there’s a lot riding on Nvidia results, and investors are split on predictions for the Fed’s next rate decision.</p>

<p>The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the morning after a near-unanimous vote in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a>.</p>
<p>By unanimous consent, the Senate agreed to pass the measure as soon as it arrived in the chamber from the House on Tuesday, which had overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier that day in a 427-1 tally. Once the legislation is forwarded to the Senate, it will be automatically approved and cleared for Trump’s signature. The president, who dropped his opposition after it was clear it would pass, has said he would sign it.</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>In August, Donald Trump started a campaign of aggression against Venezuela. The US president first launched airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of the South American country – a move largely condemned as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-strikes-against-boats-in-caribbean-disregard-international-law-french-minister-says">extrajudicial killings</a> – then deployed US naval assets in the Caribbean. The Guardian's Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, explains why the claims the targeted boats were carrying drugs destined for the US are dubious and what Trump's actions could mean for the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro</p>

      <p>Some 24 million people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. But subsidies and tax credits that have made these plans more affordable for the past few years are expiring, and the cost of health insurance is likely going to double, on average, for those losing subsidies. How do you plan for that? Plus, a Cloudflare outage took down sites yesterday, and tensions between China and Japan escalated.</p>

<p>An owl found partially encased in concrete after it got inside a cement mixer in south-western Utah is expected to fly free again after it was painstakingly cleaned by animal sanctuary workers who described the bird as a “fighter”.</p>
<p>The great horned owl was found at the Black Desert Resort in the south-western part of the state and arrived at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, earlier this month with its face, chest and right wing covered in dried concrete. After making sure the bird could breathe, sanctuary workers spent days cracking apart the concrete using forceps and cleaning its feathers using toothbrushes, dish soap and their fingers.</p>

      <h1>Senate agrees to pass Epstein files bill after near-unanimous House vote | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>The bill’s support in the House and Senate is a rare moment of bipartisan agreement. Plus, Trump shrugs off Khashoggi murder during Saudi prince’s visit</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed"><strong>Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Senate moved swiftly yesterday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">to approve legislation</a> that would force the release of investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, hours after a near-unanimous vote in the House, almost wrapping up a bipartisan effort Donald Trump had fought for months.</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> The Epstein case returned dramatically to the public eye in July, when the justice department and FBI <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms">released a memo</a> saying they had nothing further to disclose about the investigation. That contradicted statements that the administration would release more information about Epstein in office.</p>
<p><strong>Why has Trump been unable to escape this</strong> <strong>case?</strong> The Epstein scandal is a core issue for a swathe of Trump’s rightwing base, some of whom believe in conspiracy theories that surround Epstein and his coterie of powerful friends. Unlike many other issues, the Epstein files have prompted rebellions from Trump’s supporters.</p>

<p>The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.</p>

      <h1>This school trains the workforce behind China's automated factories</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>China recently came out with its latest five-year plan for growth, which will guide the world’s second largest economy through 2030. In it, top Communist Party leaders have pushed to boost the country's strength in manufacturing to the next level by upgrading older factories with advanced technologies for automation.</p>
<p>The challenge, according to the Chinese ministry of education, is that the sector has tens of millions of open jobs because there aren't enough skilled workers in the labor force to fill them.</p>
<p>One school is trying to bridge that gap. Marketplace China correspondent Jennifer Pak visited it in Nanjing city.</p>

      <p>Ten years after his breakout debut, Tobias Jesso Jr. returns with a sparse yet feeble sophomore record that feels less like a proper follow-up and more like a collection of unused demos for other artists.</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>We now know 42 of the 48 of the teams that will play next year, but for a host of teams the race goes on via playoffs</p>
<p>All nine of the automatic places have been filled by the nine group winners, with the four best runners-up – DR Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Nigeria – competing in November’s playoffs in Morocco. Nigeria beat Gabon 4-1 in the first semi-final, while Cameroon fell to a last-gasp 1-0 defeat by DR Congo in the second tie. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">DR Congo</a></strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">upset Nigeria</a> after a gripping penalty shootout in the final, and go through to represent Africa in the intercontinental playoffs in March.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt</strong> Mohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 in Casablanca in October and made up for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/sadio-mane-penalty-africa-day-of-world-cup-qualifying-joy-and-pain-senegal-egypt">missing out on Qatar 2022</a> by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South America <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/13/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-conte-verde-uruguay">after a storm delayed them</a>.</p>

      <p>The White House’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications is adding extra pressure to health care systems in rural and low-income areas. Historically, the visa has been a critical pipeline for skilled health workers in hard-to-staff settings. Affected hospitals are already feeling the added strain.

      <h1>Trump administration takes major step toward dismantling the Education Department</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department. It represents a major step forward for the administration’s dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since President Donald Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March. Six planned agreements to be signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that would put the Department of Labor over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools.</p>

<p>The US House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that will force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> allies backed down from their opposition amid a scandal that has dogged the president since his return to the White House.</p>
<p>Though Trump has for months dismissed the uproar over the government’s handling of the Epstein case as a “Democrat hoax”, he signaled his support for the House bill over the weekend, and said he would sign the measure if it reaches his desk. Here is how the House voted.</p>

</ul>
<p>On Tuesday, the Guardian published an investigation into allegations against Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.</p>
<p>The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by the MLS Players’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.</p>
<p>Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.</p>
<p>Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”</p>
<p>Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”</p>
<p>Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.</p>
<p>Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.</p>

<p>From a box above the field at PayPal Park in San Jose, Ernst Tanner looked on. It was 10 June 2023, and his Union team were losing a physical match 2-1 to the San Jose Earthquakes. Jamiro Monteiro, a player Tanner had brought to the Union in 2019 before trading him to San Jose, was being substituted. Monteiro, clearly exhausted, trudged to the Earthquakes’ bench as referee Nima Saghafi extended his arm and ushered him along, briefly making contact.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Saghafi had touched the midfielder. In the first half, with Monteiro on the ground after being sent flying by a tackle, Saghafi placed his hand on Monteiro’s back, a small gesture meant to show concern.</p>

      <p>Delivery company struggling to convince US chain Kroger, its most important customer, of the virtues of automation</p>
<p>That’s quite a stock market journey: from 180p <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/20/ocado-slash-shares-float-price">at listing 15 years ago</a> to the mighty heights of £29 during the locked-down Covid year of 2020 and now – oh dear – all the way back down to 180p. Welcome to Ocado, which looked like the future of grocery retailing once upon a time but now seems to be struggling to convince its most important customer of the virtues of robots and automation.</p>
<p>There is no positive gloss to put on news that Kroger, the US supermarket chain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/18/ocado-shares-drop-after-us-partner-announces-warehouse-closures-kroger">is closing three of its eight warehouses</a> that use Ocado’s technology. Kroger was the client that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/us-deal-boosts-ocados-stock-market-value-above-5bn">put a rocket under the UK group’s share price</a> in the first place in 2018 by signing a partnership deal. If Ocado could prove the worth of its kit in the world’s largest consumer market, went the bulls’ argument, valuation doubts would disappear.</p>

      <p>Critics accuse the US president of trying to ‘shut women journalists up’ with ‘demeaning language’</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who has a history of making extremely personal attacks on female journalists, referred to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” during a clash onboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>
<p>While the remark did not initially get much attention, it picked up some traction on Tuesday and has drawn backlash from fellow journalists, including some who have previously been attacked by Trump themselves.</p>

      <h1>Aid for farmers, but not from tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is starting a second round of aid — about $16 billion — for farmers affected by natural disasters. The aid is aimed at growers of fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts. As for aid from President Donald Trump's tariffs? The government's still busy crunching the numbers. Plus, we'll discuss what direction the U.S. economy is headed and hear how AI can help companies soften the blow from tariffs.</p>

<p>The archdiocese of New Orleans has begun a three-week confirmation trial that will determine whether a federal bankruptcy judge signs off on a $230m settlement meant to compensate 650 clergy abuse survivors and resolve one of the US’s longest-running and costliest church bankruptcies.</p>
<p>US bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill will decide whether the plan – five and a half years in the making – is fair to the survivors and dozens of other creditors who have waited through repeated delays, contentious negotiations and a protracted legal fight over a 2021 state law giving survivors of decades-old child sexual abuse the right to sue.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After being expelled from his homeland in 1972, the academic has grappled with questions of political belonging – a major theme of his son’s mayoral campaign</p>
<p>The night before Mahmood Mamdani was expelled from Uganda in 1972, a senior professor from the university where he had been employed as a lowly teaching assistant wandered into his family home, looking for spoils. The rest of the family had already left – for the UK, the US and Tanzania – but 26-year-old Mamdani had decided to remain until the final day of the three-month period that Idi Amin, the Ugandan president, had designated for all Asians to leave the country. Passing over the furniture and other remnants of decades of family life, the professor hit upon a carton of Johnnie Walker Red, which Mamdani invited him to take home.</p>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani swept the election on a campaign all about affordability. One pillar of that platform was the idea of city-owned grocery stores. The thinking: Prices at these city-owned stores would be lower because they’d operate in city-owned spaces, so they wouldn’t have to pay rent or property taxes. Other cities have tried this. How'd the experiment go? But first: the world's largest official creditor and rising utility costs.</p>

<p>Last summer, a wildlife photographer saw, or believed he saw, a mountain lion in South Burlington, Vermont. While it’s possible, it is also remarkable: the apex predator was rendered extinct in northern New England in 1881 and the nearest confirmed breeding population is in North Dakota, 2,000 miles away.</p>
<p>But there could be in years hence more definitive sightings if Mighty Earth, a US-headquartered rewilding organization, convinces state and local authorities, along with Vermonters in general, that returning the top-level predator – known in various regions as the cougar, puma, panther and, in the north-east, catamount – to the region.</p>

      <h1>Google's CEO on the AI boom and potential bubble</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The artificial intelligence revolution is firmly underway, with tech giants investing billions in research and battling to secure key assets. It's led to a surging stock market, but also panic about the potential impact on jobs and society. Google is one of the companies investing heavily in the new technology. Today, we check in with CEO Sundar Pichai. Plus, the U.K. plans to ban the resale of event tickets for profit.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Violence has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/west-bank-surge-settler-violence-israel-palestine">increased across the occupied West Bank</a> as Palestinian farmers try to harvest their olive trees before the end of the season, in the face of a campaign of harassment by groups of armed and aggressive Israeli settlers.</p>
<p><strong>How many attacks were there last month?</strong> The UN logged more than 260 attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in the West Bank in October alone – the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the Gaza peace plan?</strong> Yesterday, the UN security council <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan">endorsed proposals</a> put forward by Donald Trump for a lasting peace in Gaza, including the deployment of an international stabilization force and a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state. China and Russia abstained.</p>

      <p>
      <p>When I was a college basketball player, some believed we were treated differently from other Black and Brown people. An event last weekend suggests otherwise</p>
<p>It was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.</p>
<p>I listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s focus on race backfires as voters punish economic failings</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race over the economy is costing the US president</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living, propelled by the sharp burst of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation">inflation</a> that peaked at 9% a year in July 2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the economy. The other theme was race.</p>
<p>The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’ economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/trump-tariffs-food">trying to recover</a> his economic narrative. But it may be too late.</p>

      <h1>The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron Lakers</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Shipped out of Dallas and dropped into Hollywood, Dončić has responded with a leaner body, a louder voice and a growing command of the Lakers’ post-LeBron future</p>
<p>It’s been nine and a half months since the trade that rocked the sports world <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">was broken via a Shams Charania tweet</a>. It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/11/dallas-mavericks-fire-nico-harrison-luka-doncic-trade">was let go by the team last week</a>, in a move Mavericks fans have been <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-02-08/hundreds-of-dallas-mavericks-fans-protest-luka-doncic-trade-to-lakers">loudly clamoring for</a> since news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood. And, as it turns out, the future is now.</p>
<p>While Dončić’s breakup with the Mavericks was both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/27/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-fallout-human-element">very public and very messy</a> (the Mavs were not shy about vocalizing their reasoning for the move, and painting the 26-year-old in an unflattering light in the process), the silver linings showed themselves quickly. Dončić might not have considered himself suited for the Los Angeles spotlight, but with his flair for the dramatic and a feel for the sport’s theater, playing for such a high-profile franchise has proved an unexpectedly good fit. And it couldn’t have worked out better for the Lakers: the team had been staring at an uncertain future, with the retirement of 40-year-old LeBron James looming, and Davis’s injury history creating a cloud of doubt around his ability to be the No 1 option in the eventual aftermath. Enter Luka stage right: a ticket to franchise salvation, equipped with the newfound motivation that can only be borne from being publicly and mercilessly dragged through the mud.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The so-called Judgment Day will generate millions of dollars and attract huge ratings, but leave boxing a little more broken</p>
<p>The unsurprising confirmation of “a colossal global showdown” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/12/anthony-joshua-jake-paul-december-miami-fight-netflix">between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua</a> arrived on Monday morning with a dull thud. That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.</p>
<p>Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide">call for Republicans</a> to back the release of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> files, an abrupt reversal, is a rare instance of the president being unable to tame his Maga base and being instead forced to accede to it.</p>
<p>Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files. Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea late last month, some tariffs have been suspended or lowered, and China said it will restart purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural goods. To hear about the mood among Chinese buyers and U.S. exporters, Marketplace's Jennifer Park recently attended a trade show in Shanghai. But first: an ethics violation by a former Fed and the impacts of delayed government data.</p>

      <h1>US will label supposed Venezuelan drug cartel ‘headed by Maduro’ as terrorist organization</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>Experts believe decision is designed to pressure Venezuela’s leader into stepping down with threat of military force</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-drugs-regime-change">Is US preparing to attack Venezuela and how has Maduro regime responded?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The US has said it will designate a putative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuelan</a> drug cartel allegedly led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> as a foreign terrorist organization, as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages over its crusade against Venezuela’s authoritarian leader.</p>
<p>The move to target the already proscribed group, the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), was announced by Marco Rubio on Sunday. “Headed by the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” the US secretary of state tweeted, generating excitement among hardline adversaries of Maduro who interpreted the announcement as proof Washington was preparing to intensify its push to force the South American dictator from power.</p>

What might those numbers be able to tell us (whenever they do come out) about some of the impacts of the president’s tariffs? Plus, China has a glut of EVs, and that oversupply is starting to spill over into the rest of the world.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Trump tells Republicans to vote to release Epstein files, in reversal of previous stance</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The US president says he backs lawmakers’ efforts to release the files before an expected House vote this week. Plus: is there a dark side to gratitude?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed"><strong>Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide">reversing his previous resistance to such a move</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why the sudden U-turn?</strong> The House was expected to vote to release the files anyway, as early as tomorrow. There has been fervent suspicion within Trump’s usually loyal Maga base that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite with whom the financier associated – including Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Has Trump made up with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been calling for the files to be released?</strong> No, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/17/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-democrats-world-cup-us-politics-live-news-updates">doubled down on his attacks</a> against the Republican lawmaker, despite his reversal on resisting the release of the Epstein files. Greene, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks">she hopes they can make it up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does Israel’s limited data tell us about the rate of detainee casualties?</strong> Israeli authorities only provided comprehensive data for the first eight months of the war. During this period, official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> As COP30 in Brazil enters its second week, one of the key agreements protecting the Amazon rainforest is under threat from powerful Brazilian agri-business interests. Currently, a pact bans the sale of soy beans — Brazil’s largest agricultural export — grown on Amazon land deforested after 2008. Then, shares in Japanese retail and travel-related companies fell after China urged citizens not to visit the country over remarks made by Japan's prime minister about Taiwan.</p>

      <h1>Bridging the uncanny valley of lab-grown meat</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>About a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from our food systems, and livestock production is a big part of that. Experts largely agree that one of the biggest actions individuals can take to lower emissions is to eat less meat.</p>
<p>But that's a hard sell for a lot of consumers. Americans have actually been eating more meat in recent years, and sales of plant-based meat alternatives have dropped.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies out there trying to innovate climate-friendly meat and alternatives for the future.</p>
<p>For our podcast &quot;How We Survive,&quot; Marketplace's Amy Scott visits a lab at Columbia University where researchers are figuring out how to make a more convincing and enjoyable fake meat.</p>

      <h1>Déjà boo: Sam Darnold didn’t think he’d see ghosts on the field again. Then he faced the Rams</h1>

      <p>The Seahawks quarterback has looked like an MVP this season. But his old failings returned in Los Angeles on Sunday</p>
<p>The biggest game of Week 11 was undoubtedly the matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks. Both teams came in with 7-2 records, and were seemingly evenly matched on both sides of the ball, with dynamic offenses and stingy defenses. In the end, it was a defensive battle that the Rams won, 21-19, by the skin of their teeth.</p>
<p>Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who had played <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/14/nfl-midseason-ish-awards-darnolds-rise-to-mvp-and-a-surprising-browns-rookie">at a near-MVP level this season</a> for the most part, did absolutely nothing to help his team – and plenty to hurt them. Darnold matched his career high with four interceptions, completing 29 of 44 passes for 279 yards, no touchdowns, those picks, and a passer rating of 45.5.</p>

<p>Josh Allen has become the first NFL player to have two games with three touchdowns passing and three rushing. He achieved the feat as he led the Buffalo Bills (7-3) to victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4). Allen’s last TD was a rugged nine-yard run with 2:35 left that put the game away. The Bills benched struggling receiver Keon Coleman in a bid to spark their passing game, and each of Allen’s three touchdown passes went for 25 yards or more. He finished 19 of 30 for 317 yards, and the Bills overcame his two first-half interceptions. The game featured nine lead changes.</p>

(date: 2025-11-16)
      <p>
      <p>Do small business owners think that Visa and Mastercard won’t just recoup their fees elsewhere?</p>
<p>Want to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.</p>
<p>I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who carries cash anymore? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over something that’s clearly a thing of the past?</p>

      <p>Long after his conviction for sexual abuse, people in royalty, academia, business, journalism and politics sought his ear</p>

<p>Yet none appeared to challenge Epstein over his horrific crimes. If silence is complicity, the casual disdain of the elite circles he moved in spoke volumes.</p>

<p>At first light in Massachusetts bay, a North Atlantic right whale threads the shallows with her calf tucked into her slipstream. She surfaces, and the V-shaped breath – two brief feathers of vapor – vanishes in the cold air.</p>
<p>The calf is roughly three months old, about the length of a small truck, still learning the rhythm: rise, breathe, tuck back into mother’s wake. They are doing what every mammal mother and baby do: moving toward food and a safer place.</p>

      <p>Leona Tate has built a center at the former school she and her two six-year-old friends braved angry crowds to attend – the same day as Ruby Bridges’ better-known experience</p>
<p>Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks. Others were holding picket signs against school integration.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget it,” Etienne said. “I saw this one lady was pregnant and had a garbage can top in her hand. I’m wondering, at six years old, what could I have done at six years old to these people to make them act the way they were acting? I really thought that if they could get to me, they’d want to kill me. I didn’t know why. What had I done? I was just going to school.”</p>

      <p>A few days ago, Donald Trump called a 30-year-old White House staffer into the Oval Office and offered him a new job. So, why is this a story? Well, let's talk about Paul Ingrassia...</p>

      <p>Ex-FTC chair was among first to go after practice of folding local firms into larger ones leading to higher prices</p>
<p>Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries.</p>
<p>Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll-ups”, acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality.</p>

      <h1>Taylor Swift’s silence on the Trump administration using her music speaks volumes | Alim Kheraj</h1>

(date: 2025-11-15)
      <p>
      <p>Official Trump social media accounts have been using The Life of a Showgirl snippets to promote his agenda. Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whitehouse/video/7568317055292738830">first</a>, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569701713712631095?lang=en">One</a>, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569982996640501023?lang=en">other</a>, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/09/white-stripes-trump-lawsuit-seven-nation-army">The White Stripes</a> and the estate of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89w28w13zxo">Isaac Hayes</a> have both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/08/olivia-rodrigo-trump-video">Olivia Rodrigo condemned</a> the administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).</p>

<p>The texts, released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday, show that as early as June 2018, the pair were devising responses to the gathering storm of public outrage about Epstein’s criminal history, his favorable treatment by the justice system, and his friendships with powerful figures in business, politics and academia.</p>

<li>
<p>Any compensation not regarded as problematic</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Celtic are to accelerate talks with Wilfried Nancy over the weekend as the Columbus Crew manager edges closer to replacing Brendan Rodgers in Glasgow. Celtic are understood to have informed the Major League Soccer side on Friday of their plans, with any compensation required to coax the Frenchman not regarded as problematic. Nancy is believed to be keen on the switch.</p>
<p>Celtic hope to have Nancy in place by the time they visit St Mirren next weekend, which would bring an end to Martin O’Neill’s caretaker spell.

      <h1>Does the Fed now have a "dueling mandate"?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Even though we haven’t gotten recent economic data because of the government shutdown, there’s still plenty of speculation that the next Fed meeting will be a contentious one. We hear from Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, about how the slowing job market and creeping inflation may force the guardians of interest rates into uncomfortable compromises. Plus, a look at why the Trump administration is lowering some tariffs on imported food items from Latin America. And, a chat with McKinsey’s Michael Chui about how companies are utilizing AI and what that means for the workforce.</p>

      <p>Text messages released by US House show convicted sex offender coaching Maga influencer on political messaging. Plus, readers’ favourite photo booth moments 100 years after its invention</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon">a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon</a> during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.</p>
<p><strong>What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?</strong> Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with</strong> <strong>rest of the Epstein files?</strong> Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it?

<p>Around 1:30 AM Friday, a car swerved off Central Avenue in the Sutherland neighbourhood and blew through the front entrance of a Home Hardware store. By 8:00 a.m., the owner had the place ready to open for business as usual.</p>

<p>The development would be just the latest in a series of moves by Trump acolytes at the Department of Justice who are transforming the voting section of the agency from an office focused on protecting Americans’ voting rights to one that is in lockstep with an election denial movement that incessantly demands investigations and drastic reductions in access to the polls based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s lies about elections.</p>

<p>The head of an antisemitism watchdog has come out against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other groups for their “divisive, hyperbolic and aggressive response” to Zohran Mamdani’s election, warning that a combative stance towards the New York City mayor-elect is a gift to the far right.</p>
<p>“The instrumentalizers of antisemitism are cheering on the divisions being created in New York City, because that’s their goal: divide people, divide Jews from each other,” said Jonathan Jacoby, the director of the Nexus Project, which works to combat antisemitism and its political abuse.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Donald Trump is set to cut import taxes on products like coffee, bananas, and beef as part of trade agreements with four Latin American countries, aimed at easing food prices. A tariff of 10% will stay on most goods from Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador. But staples like coffee and bananas, which the U.S. can’t produce enough of, will be exempt.</p>

      <h1>From conscience to platforming Trump: inside the slow death of ‘woke’ ESPN</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>The broadcaster was once attacked by critics for being too progressive. But that stance appears to have changed for good in Trump’s second term</p>
<p>“What happened to the Redskins, by the way?” Donald Trump asked in <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/11/12/mcafee-defends-trump-interview-amid-backlash-over-veterans-day-appearance/">an interview on the Pat McAfee Show</a> that notably did not stick to sports. His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.</p>
<p>Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline">a government shut down</a> that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This week we learned the Japanese investment firm Softbank sold all of its stake in the juggernaut chipmaker Nvidia. We'll get into why on today's “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.” Plus, Apple is reportedly pushing back the release of its thinnest iPhone, the Air, and Wikipedia is asking AI companies, once again, to pay for scraping its data.</p>
<p>But first, back to that big move by Softbank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son. It cashed out its stake in Nvidia in October, the same month that the chipmaker hit a <span class="math inline">\(5 trillion valuation. The \)</span>5.8 billion it netted will be redirected to OpenAI, part of a promised $30 billion to be invested in the maker of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, about what all this means.</p>

<p>Cynthia Erivo came to the rescue of The Wicked: For Good co-star Ariana Grande when a man rushed Grande, forcibly putting an arm around her, while on the yellow carpet for the Singapore premiere of the film, prompting security to take him away and a Singapore court to fine him $2,000.</p>

      <p>Between 1934 and 1936, artist Dorothy Waugh was commissioned to create 17 posters for the National Park Service, a groundbreaking opportunity for a female designer at the time.

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>With the season more than halfway done, we look at the outstanding figures from the 2025 campaign so far</p>
<p><strong>Sam Darnold, QB, Seahawks.</strong> With apologies to Jonathan Taylor, we know how this story goes. MVP doesn’t stand for Most Valuable Player anymore. It stands for Most Valuable Quarterback on a 12-win team with a nice storyline. That gives us three frontrunners: Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye and Darnold.</p>

      <p>Midfielder is preparing for NWSL semi-final on her latest loan and hopes road will lead her to Gunners’ first team</p>
<p>The headline on Arsenal’s website in early August 2023 was short and sweet. “Teenage trio to join Watford on dual agreement,” it read. That trio included Michelle Agyemang and Katie Reid, two players whose names were known to the keenest of fans then and who have since become part of mainstream conversation for hugely positive reasons. More recently they have hit the headlines for a more devastating reason, having both sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</p>
<p>In any footballer’s career a bit of good fortune is needed, alongside a manager being brave enough to take a chance on you. The knee injury that led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/leah-williamson-to-miss-start-of-arsenals-wsl-season-due-to-knee-injury#:~:text=Williamson%20ruptured%20an%20anterior%20cruciate,injuries%20are%20not%20directly%20linked.">Leah Williamson missing the start</a> of the Women’s Super League season created the space for Reid to be given an opportunity in the first team, while an AlessiaRusso ankle knock led to Agyemang’s first England call-up in April. Both subsequently shone, making the forced interruptions to their respective professional journeys <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/11/katie-reid-arsenal-womens-football-acl-injuries">especially cruel</a>.</p>

      <h1>Detained in US for speech, a UK commentator speaks out: ‘It’s a tragedy of justice’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Sami Hamdi was detained after a pro-Israel group released a video purportedly showing him praising the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel</p>
<p>A British political commentator who was detained by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> authorities in the US over his pro-Palestinian advocacy said shortly after returning to the UK on Thursday that his detention was “less an attack on me and more an attack on Americans and the rights of Americans themselves”.</p>
<p>Sami Hamdi arrived in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> on Thursday , three weeks after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco international airport while on a speaking tour in the US. He agreed to leave the country after being guaranteed the right to apply for a new US visa, which he says he plans to do.</p>

<p>Democrats appear more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting in next year’s congressional elections following the party’s victories in recent state and local contests, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which showed Republican President Donald Trump’s approval steady at 40%.</p>
<p>The six-day poll, which closed on Wednesday, showed 44% of registered voters who called themselves Democrats said they were “very enthusiastic” about voting in the November 3, 2026, elections, compared with 26% of Republicans who said the same. Some 79% of Democrats said they would regret it if they didn’t vote in the election, compared to 68% of Republicans.</p>

      <p>A wildlife photographer out on a whale watching trip in waters off Seattle captured dramatic video and photos of a pod of killer whales hunting a seal that survived only by clambering onto the stern of her boat. Charvet Drucker was on a rented 20-foot (6-meter) boat near her home on an island in the Salish Sea about 40 miles northwest of Seattle when she spotted a pod of at least eight killer whales, also known as orcas. Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod</p>

      <p>Attempts to persuade two female members of Congress to withdraw backing for petition appear to have failed – key US politics stories from Thursday 13 November at a glance</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p>The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.</p>

<p>The justice department on Thursday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-governor-gavin-newsom-californias-race-based-redistricting-plan">joined a lawsuit</a> brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump. The <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-13-United-States-complaint-in-intervention.pdf">justice department’s intervention</a> in the case sets up a high-profile showdown between the Trump administration and Newsom, one of the president’s chief antagonists and a possible 2028 contender.</p>

<p>Analysis by the Guardian found Epstein sent an email asking “what is your schedule?” on 23 July 2010 to an associate.

In an extraordinary turn of events, Kevin Stitt, the state’s Republican governor, accepted the Oklahoma pardon and parole board’s recommendation that Wood’s sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. Wood was convicted of felony murder in the stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, a 19-year-old migrant farm worker from Montana, during a botched robbery in 2001</p>

      <h1>Carlos Alcaraz beats Lorenzo Musetti to put Alex de Minaur in last four: ATP Finals tennis – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>Already through to the semi-finals, Carlos Alcaraz was far too good for Lorenzo Musetti, a 6-4 6-1 win ensuring he ends the year as world no 1</p>
<p><strong>Of course my wife ordered the shopping to arrive, then went to a work dinner.</strong> But it’s in, you’ll be relieved to learn, and they’re still knocking up.</p>
<p><strong>Alcaraz, meantime, looks focused.</strong> He’ll not be taking it easy tonight, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Seven people detained at California’s largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center have sued the US government, alleging they have been denied essential medications, frequently go hungry and are housed in a “decrepit” facility.</p>
<p>The federal class-action complaint filed against ICE on Wednesday challenges the “inhumane conditions” at the California City detention center, which opened in late August inside a shuttered state prison. The suit alleges “life-threatening” medical neglect, with the plaintiffs saying they have been denied cancer treatment, basic disability accommodations and regular insulin for diabetes.</p>

      <p>Britain was always going to prefer homegrown technology for the SMR reactors at Wylfe. The US would have done the same</p>

<p>Now there’s an atomic split over the first significant decision. The UK has allocated Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/13/us-disappointed-that-rolls-royce-will-build-uks-first-small-modular-reactors">to host three small modular reactors (SMRs)</a> to be built by the British developer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup">Rolls-Royce</a> SMR.

      <h1>Timeline of US government shutdown that left workers and services in chaos</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>Week by week, key moments from the 43-day shutdown that disrupted flights, food benefits and federal work</p>
<p>When Senate Democrats decided in September to use the government funding bill to put up a fight over expiring healthcare subsides, it set the stage for a 43-day federal government shutdown marked by turmoil for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, a battle over food benefits, thousands of cancelled flights, and a rare Democratic stand against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s second-term agenda that progressives had been demanding since the election.</p>
<p>Each week brought new disruptions and frustrations, until a group of seven moderate Democrats and one independent struck a deal to reopen the government in exchange for a promised – but not guaranteed – vote on the healthcare subsidies by mid-December.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffery Epstein</a> files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p>The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.</p>

But the shutdown deal also included spending bills funding military construction, the legislative branch, the Agriculture Department, and the VA. We went through the lesser-known provisions so you don't have to. Also: the state of Canada's energy exports and potential limits to the power of proxy advisory firms.</p>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>For centuries, the US government tried to erase Indigenous identity, with boarding schools, adoptions and a chilling mission: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”</p>
<p>In 1978, a law was passed to protect Native American families. But it didn’t fix the system. Today, Native children are still being removed at shocking rates. In South Dakota, they’re 13% of the child population but 74% of the children in the foster system.</p>

      <h1>Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, newly released emails suggest | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>One email, released by Democrats on House oversight committee, says Trump ‘spent hours’ with one trafficking victim. Plus, Al Gore wonders if ‘bullying’ Trump prompted Bill Gates to backtrack on climate</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Newly released emails <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/jeffrey-epstein-new-emails-donald-trump">suggest Donald Trump knew about the conduct</a> of the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including one memo in which Epstein said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls” he trafficked, and another that said Trump had “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.</p>
<p><strong>What do the emails say?</strong> One message from Epstein to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in April 2011, mentions Trump by name, saying: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.” The redacted name was Virginia Giuffre, who had described being trafficked, though she did not accuse Trump of abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Who voted against their caucus?</strong> Six Democrats voted for the bill: Adam Gray of California, Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine. Two Republicans voted against it: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida.</p>

      <p>
      <p>By now, you know that the House passed legislation last night to reopen the government. But you might not know about a provision that would completely change the way hemp is regulated. It was tucked into the new farm bill, which was also approved last night, and funds the Agriculture Department through September. We'll hear more. Plus, are government institutions shifting resources away from the working class? Professor Clara Mattei argues that's the case.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> India’s government has approved a $5 billion credit line to support its struggling exporters, as Indian workers across sectors like textiles, jewelry, and seafood face major potential job losses. Then, attendees of COP30 are hoping for a U.N.-backed deal to impose a levy on emissions for large ships. Research also presented at the climate summit warns that global carbon emissions from coal, oil, and gas are set to reach a record high in 2025.</p>

      <p>Residents are organizing in response to raids across the city amid Trump’s wide-ranging ‘operation midway blitz’</p>
<p>Anaís Robles didn’t expect to get teargassed. The co-owner of Colibrí Cafe, the coffee shop that opened this year in Chicago’s East Side neighborhood, saw commotion outside in mid October and ran to see what happened.</p>
<p>Robles saw federal agents donning masks and decided to step back, she was half a block away when the tear gas canisters hit. “People were just in the streets, so to clear out the area, they teargas all of us, and like, multiple teargas [cannisters],” she said.</p>

      <h1>The other clásico: Barcelona and Real Madrid’s rivalry thrives on the basketball court too</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>The showdown channels centuries of Spanish tension and pride – and may soon collide with the NBA’s ambitions to expand into Europe</p>
<p>Scores of fans filed past the silhouettes of cranes and construction work surrounding Barcelona’s Camp Nou last Friday night. But they weren’t there for the world famous soccer stadium. Instead, the sea of Barça jerseys was heading for the club’s basketball arena, the Palau Blaugrana. There was an expectant but apprehensive buzz in the air – the night marked a big occasion: Real Madrid were in town.</p>
<p>It’s widely accepted that the biggest rivalry in basketball is between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#Records_by_franchise">between them</a> they have won almost half of all championships in NBA history. The Lakers-Celtics showdowns of the 1980s went beyond basketball and embodied different Americas: West Coast glitz versus East Coast grit; flashy fastbreak basketball versus fundamentals; and, frankly, though perhaps sometimes oversimplistically, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/29/basketball-magic-johnson-larry-bird">Black versus white</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>Tech firms are racing to develop robot assistants that can take over our dreaded household chores. But teaching machines to perform these deceptively simple tasks is tedious. They need to observe the actions thousands, sometimes millions of times. And there's a cottage industry springing up to provide this training.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Ayanna Howard, roboticist and dean of Ohio State University’s college of engineering, to learn more.</p>

<p>While society's obsession with female bodies is nothing new, a wave of celebrities who embraced their larger bodies are shedding pounds — often with the help of weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro — and it's touched a cultural nerve. While some have bemoaned the supposed betrayal, others point out the hypocrisy of shaming women for losing weight.</p>

<p>Doctors at one of Montreal's largest family medicine clinics, located in Ahuntsic, say they are worried Bill 2 will make it harder to do their jobs. Since the reform was originally tabled by the Quebec government last spring, the clinic's medical director said he has lost nine family doctors.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After 42-day standoff, government is back open – and minority party won no concessions from party in power</p>
<p>More than 42 days ago, beleaguered congressional Democrats employed a tactic they were not known for using – refusing to fund the government unless their demands, in this case, an extension of tax credits that lowered costs for Affordable Care Act health plans, were met.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Wednesday evening, and the federal government is back open, the Democrats’ resistance breached by the combined forces of Congress’s Republican majorities and a splinter group of Democratic senators who provided just enough votes to get a funding bill past the chamber’s filibuster.</p>

      <p>Bill passes House with with 222 in favor and 209 against. Here’s how Republicans and Democrats voted</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives voted to pass the funding bill to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote">end the longest government shutdown</a> in US history. Trump signed the bill into law on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The legislation comes in the wake of a Senate-brokered compromise in which a handful of Democrats voted toforego the extension of expiring healthcare subsidies, which have been at the heart of the long impasse. The bill extends government funding at current levels through January. Three year-long provisions, which fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations, are also included.</p>

<p>The longest US government shutdown in history ended on Wednesday after more than 42 days, following the House of Representative’s passage of a bill negotiated by Republicans and a splinter group of Democrat-aligned senators.</p>
<p>The compromise sets the stage for government operations to return to normal through January, while leaving unresolved the issue of expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare health plans, which most Democrats demanded be extended in any deal to reopen the government.</p>

<p>Paul had originally been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis on 14 November at the Kaseya Center, but the event was cancelled after Davis was removed from the card <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/boxing/article/gervonta-davis-faces-new-domestic-violence-allegations-in-civil-lawsuit-filed-just-weeks-before-jake-paul-bout-234321093.html">amid domestic violence allegations.</a> Davis’s former partner, Courtney Rossel, filed a civil lawsuit in Miami-Dade County accusing the lightweight champion of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Miami Gardens police confirmed they are investigating the alleged incident, which Rossel says occurred at the strip club where she works. She was granted a restraining order shortly afterwards.</p>

      <h1>Nothing to see here: Trump press chief in full denial mode over Epstein</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Karoline Leavitt defied the laws of moral physics to insist that the true wrongdoers were Biden and the Democrats</p>
<p>Donald Trump was described as “that dog that hasn’t barked” in email by Jeffrey Epstein. Don’t tell Kristi Noem, who has a way of dealing with troublesome hounds.</p>
<p>The US president would love nothing more than to let sleeping dogs lie, but that hope was dashed on Wednesday when Democrats released emails suggesting that Trump was aware of Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors and had spent hours with one victim.</p>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Trump says release of Epstein emails is a distraction from Democrats’ performance during shutdown; White House says they ‘prove absolutely nothing’</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In a new batch of emails <a href="https://x.com/OversightDems/status/1988600468990484626?s=20">released by Democrats</a> on the House oversight committee, Jeffrey Epstein wrote that Donald Trump knew about the late financier and sex-offender’s conduct. In the three emails released, Epstein apparently told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell that Trump <strong>“spent hours”</strong> at his house with one of Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>In two other emails to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that <strong>“of course he knew about the girls”</strong>, referring to the now-president. According to the exchanges, Epstein also solicited Wolff’s advice about how he should handle Trump discussing their friendship in an interview with CNN. “I think you should let him hang himself,” Wolff writes. “If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.”</p>

      <p>Saikat Chakrabarti wants to turn Trump’s gilded ballroom into a museum on authoritarianism</p>
<p>Rooting out corruption in government is at the center of Saikat Chakrabarti’s campaign for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a>. And if elected next year, the 39-year-old former Silicon Valley engineer – now running to succeed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> in her long-held San Francisco seat – says he would put it on display for every American to see.</p>
<p>As part of his anti-corruption agenda, Chakrabarti says he would introduce legislation to turn Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom">gilded White House ballroom</a> into the “Smithsonian Museum on Corruption and Authoritarianism”. Looking ahead to a post-Trump Washington, Chakrabarti envisions filling the 90,000 sq ft structure, to be built in place of the now-demolished East Wing, with exhibits dedicated to the “modern dangers posed by the current wannabe dictator, the ongoing threat of authoritarianism, assaults on the rule of law and the pervasive corruption of the billionaire class”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump and Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte have floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage as a potential way to make homebuying more affordable. The president has said that longer mortgages would lower borrowers’ monthly payments, which is true — but at what cost? And later, 47 economists filed an amicus brief in Trump's tariffs case before the Supreme Court. We'll unpack what they said.</p>

<p>Military families living on an air force base in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a> have been ordered to dismantle their Christmas decorations under a strictly enforced regulation that tells them when and where they are allowed to celebrate.</p>
<p>Residents of Tyndall air force base received a tersely-worded memo from their landlords, private housing contractor Balfour Beatty Communities, informing them that a de facto patrol of the installation had uncovered infractions of their lease agreements in the form of early holiday inflatables, lights and other festive adornments.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal for Ontario has ruled that the province's regulated online gaming websites can legally allow gamblers in the province to play with people outside of Canada.

<p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/venezuelans-el-salvador-trump-torture-report">250 Venezuelans deported from the US to El Salvador</a> by the Trump administration have suffered systemic and prolonged torture and abuse including sexual assault in detention, according to a new report.</p>
<p><strong>What rights violations do they report</strong> <strong>?</strong> Being subjected to “constant beatings”, as well as other forms of ill treatment, including some cases of sexual violence, according to the report. They also report lengthy incommunicado detention and being provided with inadequate food.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about who the</strong> <strong>detainees are?</strong> Despite the administration accusing the deportees of being members of Tren de Aragua, an organized crime gang, the report found that just 3% had been convicted in the US of a violent crime.</p>
<p><strong>How many more sites are planned?</strong> About 3,500 new sites are proposed or under development, placing the health of a further 135 million people at risk.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Binod Shah, a refugee from Bhutan, went to church, got married and started an auto shop in Twin Falls, Idaho. But an arrest record got him caught in the ICE dragnet</p>
<p>Stephanie Shah kept her eyes on the winding road as rain streaked across the windshield. Her husband, Binod Shah, sat in silence beside her, staring out the window. It was late evening in Washington state on 23 March, and they had been driving all day, trading shifts, barely speaking, while their nine-month-old son dozed beneath a blanket in the backseat. The sky hung low and gray, and evergreens, soaked and still, stood witness along the road. Inside the car, a Nepali-Christian folk song played quietly on repeat. At some point, Binod reached over and rested his hand on Stephanie’s leg. It wasn’t reassurance. It felt more like a final touch.</p>
<p>When the baby started to cry, Stephanie pulled over and together they changed his diaper, working without words. Then Binod leaned down, kissed his son’s forehead, and began to cry.</p>

      <p>Kentucky trio oppose provision restricting hemp-derived products, with House to vote on Wednesday on funding bill</p>
<p>A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.</p>

      <p>After 43 days, the government shutdown could end today. But there are still lingering questions: When will food stamps be distributed to beneficiaries? When will government workers receive paychecks? As for all of the economic data we missed while government agencies were closed? It won’t be released immediately once the government reopens — far from it. Then, the shuttering of the IRS' Direct File program and climate talks in Brazil.</p>

      <p>Once at the heart of record migration, the Texas border town now faces new fears over Trump’s sweeping deportation drive</p>
<p>Along southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a>, the Rio Grande forms the US-Mexico border, an arrangement established after the end of the Mexican-American war. Eagle Pass, which had been known as El Paso del Águila, became the first US settlement on the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Swimming across the river has remained treacherous ever since. But migrants never stopped risking their lives to set foot on US soil –and in 2023,those numbers reach record highs as Eagle Pass, the seat of Maverick county, became the epicenter of growing backlash over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">the Biden administration</a>’s immigration policies.</p>

      <h1>Are there enough workers to build geothermal energy networks?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>Combatting climate change will likely require a multi-pronged approach to renewable energy generation. After all, it's not sunny or windy everywhere all the time. Geothermal energy, which harnesses the natural heat generated by the earth, can significantly shrink the carbon footprint of heating and cooling buildings. Those systems are currently just a small part of the HVAC market. But the Department of Energy wants to accelerate production by 10% a year. Rae Solomon at KUNC in Northern Colorado reports on how one geothermal project in the municipality of Hayden is progressing.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump said he had an 'obligation' to sue the BBC for misrepresenting his comments before the January 6 attacks on the US Capitol in 2021. The US president reiterated his threat of launching a $1bn legal action during an interview on Fox News, saying the British broadcaster had 'defrauded the public'. The BBC has been plunged into its biggest crisis in decades after its two most senior staff, the director general, Tim Davie, and the head of news, Deborah Turness, resigned after criticism over standards and accusations of bias at the BBC, including over how it edited a speech by Trump</p>

It cites “inhumane prison conditions, including prolonged incommunicado detention, inadequate food” and other shortcomings.</p>

      <p>Smallville actor, released from prison two years ago, tells how she helped coerce women for cult leader Keith Raniere</p>
<p>The Smallville actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/05/allison-mack-smallville-nxivm-sex-trafficking">Allison Mack</a> says she was once riveted by the influence she wielded through her role in the Nxivm sex cult – though it eventually sent her to federal prison, and she now realizes it was “abusive”.</p>
<p>“I was excited by the power that I felt having these young, beautiful women look to me and listen to me,” Mack, 43, maintains in a new podcast series titled <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/allison-after-nxivm-from-uncover/id1364665348">Allison After Nxivm</a>, which contains her first public remarks since her release from prison about two years ago. “And – yes – the sexuality of it was exciting.”</p>

<p>Millions of Americans grappling with food insecurity will face more uncertainty this week after the US supreme court enabled the Trump administration to continue withholding funds for food stamps.</p>
<p>In an administrative stay issued on Tuesday, the highest court upheld the administration’s request to extend a pause on a federal judge’s ruling that would have required $4bn in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Snap, the food aid relied on by 42 million people, to be distributed. The funding freeze has been given two additional days, and will now remain in place until midnight on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Japanese technology investor SoftBank intensified the debate about valuations in the artificial intelligence world on Tuesday by revealing it had sold its stake in the chipmaker Nvidia.</p>
<p>In its latest quarterly results, SoftBank showed it had sold its shares in Nvidia for $5.8bn (£4.4bn) in October, as it doubles down on its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/30/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-25bn-in-openai-chatgpt">bets on OpenAI</a>, the group behind the ChatGPT chatbot. It also reported that second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5tn yen (£12.2bn), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.</p>

      <h1>Carlos Alcaraz battles back to beat Taylor Fritz: ATP Finals tennis – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Taylor Fritz did all he could, but it still wasn’t enough to beat Carlos Alcaraz, who recovered after losing the first set to win an epic in three</p>
<p><strong>*Alcaraz 1-1 Fritz</strong> The last thing Fritz will want is for Alcraraz to rush through an easy hold and he makes 0-15, then attacks a second serve with a backhand down the line, as we suggested he should, for 0-30. And, though Alcaraz halves his arrears, Faritz runs around his forehand to clout down the line, raising two break points; the first disappears with an overhit forehand, the second with a service winner. Up advantage, though, Alcaraz errs, and this is already ridiculously enjoyable, Fritz taking control of the next rally by landing a forehand on to the baseline and seeing it home with backhands down the line to earn a third break point. And this time he looks ready to take it, racing to net when a drop sits up … but Alcaraz reads him and puts away the volley! The anticipation there was spooky, and there’s something about watching him play that’s almost wrong, stuff that shouldn’t be possible happening with such regularity it feels unreal, or staged. And that’s exactly the next point, a no-look drop, discharged with Fritz expecting a booming cross-court shot, followed up with a perfectly disguised and perfect lob; from there, Alcaraz sees out the hold, and these two games have been of absurdly high standard.</p>
<p><strong>Alcaraz 0-1 Fritz* (denotes server)</strong> A forehand clouted wide gives Alcaraz 0-15 … but that’s nothing a service winner can’t solve. At 30-15, though, a tame forehand into the net puts him under immediate pressure … but that’s nothing an ace can’t serve. He quickly makes 40-30, too, but a backhand winner sizzles past him cross, and another netted forehand means Alcaraz has advantage. Fritz looks nervous, reflecting how well he knows he’s playing: this is is his time. He saves break point with a forehand winner, but is soon down advantage again, totally dominated in the next rally. Also again, though, he restores deuce, and this time an ace raises game point … only to be followed by a double. On the one hand, this isn’t the game Fritz had in mind when he opted to serve but, on the other, if he can see out the tension and hold, it’ll fortify him with confidence. Meantime, though, an ace earns another advantage, but again, he can’t see it out; what a start to the match this is. AND HAVE A LOOK! Again up advantage and this tome at the net with a simple putaway there for him, Fritz picks out Alcaraz who hoists a lob, then deals with the tweener sent at him in riposte via volley. That was another terrific exchange, was, restoring deuce, but Fritz again makes his ad, this time punishing down an ace to secure a nine-minute hold. MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC for its editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day his supporters overran the Capitol — in the broadcaster's flagship Panorama documentary program. The British broadcaster admitted to an 'error of judgment,' prompting two of its senior leaders to resign. Andrew Chang breaks down how all this happened, and why the network may have to pay a steep price to defend its reputation.</p>

      <h1>Israeli embassy writes to US senators defending detention of Palestinian American teen</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>The document describes Israel’s case against Mohammed Ibrahim but omits key details about his treatment</p>
<p>The Israeli embassy in Washington has been circulating a letter on Capitol Hill defending its nine-month detention of a 16-year-old US citizen in military prison as pressure mounts from senators and civil society groups who have called for his release.</p>
<p>The document, obtained by the Guardian, describes Israel’s allegations against Mohammed Ibrahim and the medical treatment he has allegedly received in prison. It does not mention his dramatic weight loss or the fact that his family has had virtually no contact with him since his arrest in February.</p>

      <h1>US flight cancellations and delays to get worse even if shutdown ends</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>As of Tuesday, more than 1,100 flights had been canceled, and more than 540 had been delayed</p>
<p>Air travelers should expect worsening cancellations and delays this week even if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">US government shutdown</a> ends, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rolled out deeper cuts to flights at 40 of the nation’s major airports Tuesday, officials said.</p>
<p>The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at the airports in question, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown">canceling</a> more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday – and again to 10% on Friday.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/trump-bbc-legal-action">welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures</a> after a campaign against the UK’s public broadcaster peaked over the criticism that a 2024 documentary used a misleading edit of a Trump speech on the day of the January 6 insurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Why did the BBC’s director general and News CEO resign?</strong> They did so after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage.</p>
<p><strong>What did the documentary show?</strong> Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, splicing him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video">telling supporters to walk to the US capitol</a> and then to “fight like hell”.</p>
<p><strong>So Trump didn’t tell people to “fight”?</strong> No, he absolutely did, many times. According to the January 6 select committee <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Report_of_the_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_the_January_6th_Attack_on_the_United_States_Capitol">report</a>, “he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/why-bbc-resignations-trump-speech-edit">exhorting the crowd to fight</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Trump doing this?</strong> The development “is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes,” writes the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-threat-media-attacks">Guardian US media correspondent, Jeremy Barr</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are the spyware companies?</strong> Paragon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite; and NSO Group, which the Biden administration had in 2021 accused of engaging in business “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”. Paragon made a deal the Trump administration in September to provide services to immigration agents.</p>

      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino chooses caution with time running out before the World Cup</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Weston McKennie remains at Juventus due to a manager change, and the US remain vulnerable to outside elements</p>
<p>When Weston McKennie signed for Juventus in 2020, it had only been 30 days since Andrea Pirlo was made the Italian club’s manager. A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – or <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/mitarbeiterhistorie/verein/506">his seventh, if you count the interim head coaches</a>. It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value. Rather than the usual routine of a manager trying to push McKennie out of the club, only to realize that there’s a reason <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/kader/verein/506/saison_id/2025/plus/1">only three players in the squad</a> have been at the club longer, Spalletti has given McKennie starts in all three matches he’s overseen. The 27-year-old has played all but five available minutes in that span.</p>

<p>Cruz-Estrada, part of a team of 20 Oregon-based firefighters, had spent a week hiking through dense terrain, battling smoke and clearing fallen trees and other debris to prevent the Bear Gulch fire, a 9,000-acre <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/inside-the-fight-to-slow-down-was-roller-coaster-bear-gulch-fire/">blaze</a>, from growing.

<p>Every other Wednesday at the Royal Canadian Legion in a rural south Ottawa community, Canadian Armed Forces veterans meet over coffee to discuss their experiences in the military.

      <h1>The old technique that could power future nuclear reactors</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Some AI companies are turning to nuclear power to meet demand for electricity. But traditional nuclear plants can take decades to bring online.</p>
<p>Now some tech companies are partnering with startups trying to build small, modular nuclear reactors, designed with speed in mind. One such company, Kairos, has a deal with Google to build a fleet of modular reactors. To do so, it’s relying on a technique first developed in the mid-20th century: molten-salt cooling.</p>

      <h1>Mark Cuban made the Mavericks relevant. But is his legacy rotten? | Lee Escobedo</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>The businessman shaped Dallas into an NBA force after years in the wilderness. But problems with the team only worsened when he sold up</p>
<p>The year 2000 cracked open like a glow stick, flooding Dallas with new money – and a new Mavericks owner, who had made his money selling his streaming site just before the dot-com crash. Like the 1990s Mavs, Mark Cuban wasn’t polished – and he sure as hell wasn’t subtle. He was brash and argumentative, clashed with refs, and clapped too hard whenever Dirk Nowitzki buried a three. The internet age, in the form of Cuban, crashed courtside when he bought the team for $285m. Gone was the era of distant owners watching occasional games from the executive boxes: the fan was in control of the team now. Cuban had hacked reality.</p>
<p>Cuban’s thesis was simple: never play by their rules. The Mavs were his start-up. He improved nutrition, upgraded hotels for road games, bought a team plane, filled lockers with PlayStations, and fought the NBA’s lawyers with the defiance of a rapper clapping off hundos in a strip club. This went against the NBA’s old boys’ club. For all his dot-com cache, Cuban was punk in practice.</p>

      <h1>Canada's Unknown Soldier in 2025: Where science collides with sacred symbolism</h1>

<p>Canada's Unknown Soldier — a casualty of the First World War — was brought home to be interred in Ottawa 25 years ago, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission forbids any attempt at identification. Advances in DNA technology mean that in future wars, the chances that soldiers won't be identified are slim. Does the concept of an Unknown Soldier still have meaning to a new, on-demand generation, or will it become a relic of a bygone era?</p>

<p>Turning Point USA, the influential rightwing college group founded by Charlie Kirk, has brought Kirk’s message to a campus with a long history of leftwing activism two months after his death.</p>
<p>An event at the University of California, Berkeley, on Monday evening marked the chaotic last stop of the American Comeback tour, which Kirk had just begun at the time of his death at Utah Valley University. In the aftermath of Kirk’s fatal shooting, the events have come to serve as memorials, with prominent conservative speakers, including JD Vance, highlighting the staggering impact the controversial rightwing influencer’s death has had on American politics.</p>

      <h1>Senate approves funding deal to end longest US government shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>Bill, which passed 60-40 but does not include key health concession demanded by Democrats, now heads to House</p>
<p>The Senate on Monday approved afunding package that is expected to bring to a close the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/government-shutdown-longest-history">longest government shutdown</a> in US history, after a coalition of Democrats broke from their party and voted with Republicans, in a move that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/chuck-schumer-resign-calls-shutdown-vote-democrats">has enraged</a> many in their caucus.</p>
<p>The vote passed in a 60-40 tally, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/10/government-shutdown-senate-vote">seven Democrats and one independent</a> joining all Republicans to approve a compromise deal that would fund most federal agencies through January. The agreement, which next goes to the House of Representatives, does not directly address the expiring tax credits for healthcare premiums, the issue at the center of the 40-day stalemate between Democrats and Republicans, though the Senate majority leader John Thune has promised a Senate vote later this year on the subsidies.</p>

      <p>Despite expectations surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, inflation doesn’t seem to be speeding up — though it’s hard to say for sure without all that reliable federal data. You can thank cooling services inflation (where most consumer spending goes) and a softer labor market, which has reduced some companies’ ability to raise prices.

      <p>Country is one of world’s most repressive and corrupt, raising concerns over rights abuses of those deported</p>
<p>The United States has sent $7.5m to the government of Equatorial Guinea, one of the world’s most repressive and corrupt regimes, to accept noncitizen deportees from the US to the West African nation, according to a leading congressional Democrat, current and former state department officials and public government data.</p>
<p>The money sent to Equatorial Guinea is the first taken from a fund apportioned by Congress to address international refugee crises – and sometimes to facilitate the resettlement of refugees in the US – that has instead been repurposed under the Trump administration to hasten their deportation.</p>

      <p>Some lawmakers and progressive groups blame minority leader after eight senators defect</p>
<p>Democrats are seething after news emerged on Sunday that eight members of their Senate caucus had collaborated with Republicans on crafting a compromise to end the longest government shutdown in US history, without winning any healthcare concessions that they had sought.</p>
<p>But one name is coming in for more opprobrium than any other: Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who had led the Democrats’ weeks-long stand against reopening the government without an extension of tax credits that lower premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.</p>

<p>Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz appeared in federal court on Monday on charges accusing him and teammate Emmanuel Clase of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/09/emmanuel-clase-luis-ortiz-gambling-allegations-baseball">taking bribes to help associates</a> win prop bets placed on pitches they threw.</p>
<p>A judge in in Boston granted Ortiz his release but with several conditions, including that he surrender his passport, restrict his travel to the US northeast and post a $500,000 bond. He must also avoid contact with anyone who could be viewed as a victim, witness or co-defendant in the case.</p>
<p>Ortiz, dressed in a pale green track suit, did not say anything in court. His lawyers declined to speak to reporters afterward.</p>

<p>The eight Democratic and Independent senators who broke ranks with the party to advance a bill that would end the government shutdown – the longest in US history – have defended their decisions amid furor from their party and base.</p>
<p>“What happened tonight is not the closing of a chapter. It’s the opening of an opportunity. What the chapter does close is the damaging shutdown that is only getting worse, that is only going to impact more and more people,”said <strong>Angus King</strong>, the Independent lawmaker from Maine who caucuses with Democrats.</p>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>The scandal has provided Trump another avenue to attack the media, and to relitigate his involvement in January 6</p>
<p>The editing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> speech on 6 January 2021 has embroiled the BBC in controversy, led to the resignations of its top leaders and given fuel to claims of media bias at the storied British broadcaster.</p>
<p>A dossier from a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee flagged the edit, among other instances of purported bias in the outlet’s coverage, which was leaked to the Telegraph. As a public sector organization, the BBC is required to be impartial, though it often faces claims of bias, particularly from the right.</p>

<p>“The past few seasons have been nothing short of disappointing, and we have not met our expectations for this franchise,” Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch said Monday in a joint statement. “We understand the frustrations of our fans, and we will work to deliver a significantly improved product.”</p>

<p>On Halloween, neighbors in the downtown <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas">Las Vegas</a> area of Huntridge gave out bags of nonperishable meal bags along with the usual trick-or-treat candy. The bag contained ingredients to make a quick chickpea curry: cans of garbanzo beans, coconut milk, crushed tomatoes, chicken, Thai seasoning and jasmine rice. Child-friendly bags held shelf-stable milk, cereals, cheese and crackers, cups of mac and cheese and meat sticks. A fancied-up ramen bag came with tinned BBQ pork, stir-fry vegetables and crunchy chow mein noodles. There were six different dinners in all.</p>
<p>The neighbors knew that shelf-stable food wouldn’t replace Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/snap-workers-trump-administration-funding">Snap</a>) benefits, commonly known as food stamps, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/01/food-banks-stock-resources-snap-lapse">food bank</a> supplies.</p>

      <p>The mayor-elect’s address pulled from Socialist titans, Astoria’s uncles and his rival’s father. Julian Gerson explains how the two collaborated on the ‘love letter to New York’</p>
<p>In his victory speech after winning the New York mayoral election last week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> came out swinging.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-victory-speech-transcript">The speech</a> included,among other dramatic flourishes, a reference to the socialist titan Eugene Debs, shoutouts to the city’s “Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses”, tributes to Jawaharlal Nehru and Fiorello La Guardia, sprinkles of Arabic – and it was all delivered with the cadence and command of a hip-hop emcee. Many who were listening could not help but wonder: how the hell did he pull that off?</p>

      <p>
      <p>The broadcaster didn’t make a very good job of its untruth – possibly because it hasn’t had as much practice</p>
<p>You have to admire the chutzpah. The cheek of it. Donald Trump describing the BBC as “corrupt” while threatening to take legal action. Karoline Leavitt, The Donald’s White House mouthpiece, calling the BBC “100% fake news”. The man has never been known for his self-awareness so it’s safe to say the irony has almost certainly passed him by. If you’re being charitable, let’s just say that maybe it takes fake news to spot fake news.</p>
<p>The US president is a master of the lie. Makes Boris Johnson look something of an amateur. Boris always followed a lie with a giveaway smirk. He couldn’t help himself. It was an integral part of his self-destruction. As if, buried deep down in his subconscious, there was a part of him that wanted to be found out.</p>

      <p>Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other amid a swirling blizzard, with one of their goals dubbed an 'icicle kick' from the Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.</p>
<p>Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of -8C (17.6F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines on the pitch and goalkeepers using shovels to mark out their boxes.</p>

<p>The Senate on Sunday evening took a key procedural vote on legislation that would end the longest government shutdown in US history. The bill resulted from days of talks between Democratic and Republican senators, and extends funding through next January, but does not include an extension of the subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans that Democrats put at the heart of their demands.</p>
<p>The deal is controversial, with most Democrats, including the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, opposing it. Here is a breakdown of how every senator voted:</p>

      <p>Commercial real estate has been struggling in the years since the pandemic. Office attendance has risen, though not as much in smaller cities. And while big banks might not be voicing concerns over this, lending for commercial real estate is a major deal for regional and community banks. We discuss. Also on today's program: markets react to a potential end in sight for the shutdown, and big movies around the holidays could drive ticket sales.</p>

<p>What was it supposed to look like? Amid all the talk around Liverpool and their disappointing form at the start of this season, that is perhaps the hardest question of all to answer. What were they trying to do? If it had worked, how would this team have played?</p>
<p>The champions spent £424m (about <span class="math inline">\(550m) on new signings in the summer, but if all had gone well, they would have spent an additional £40m (\)</span>53m) to land the Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guéhi. The England international would, at the very least, have given an extra option at the back (the injury to Giovanni Leoni has diminished their defensive options further), allowing Arne Slot to rest Ibrahima Konaté, whose poor form continued in t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/09/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">he 3-0 defeat to Manchester City</a> on Sunday.

<p>After weeks of false starts and failed votes, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">US Senate</a> secured the 60 votes needed late Sunday night <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill">to pass a compromise</a> continuing resolution that would reopen the federal government after seven Democrats and an independent sided with Republicans to support the measure to send it back to the House for another vote. The Democratic caucus has aimed anger at the defectors, who nonetheless branded their decision as being the best available option.</p>
<p>They were Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and independent Angus King of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats. Republican senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rand-paul">Rand Paul</a> of Kentucky was the sole member of his party to vote against the bill, which he has done for weeks.</p>

      <h1>Senate advances funding bill to end longest-ever US government shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>The amended package will still have to be passed by the House and sent to Trump for his signature, a process that could take days</p>
<p>The Senate on Sunday made significant progress towards ending the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">longest US government shutdown in history</a>, narrowly advancing a compromise bill to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.</p>
<p>But the measure, which resulted from days of talks between a handful of Democratic and Republican senators, leaves out the healthcare subsidies that Democrats had demanded for weeks. Most Democratic senators rejected it, as did many of the party’s lawmakers in the House of Representatives, which will have to vote to approve it before the government can reopen.</p>

<p>Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other, a snow-globe spectacle amid a swirling blizzard featuring what online media outlets dubbed an “icicle kick” from Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.</p>
<p>Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time win in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of minus 8 degrees Celsius (46.4F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines, and goalkeepers used shovels to carve out their boxes.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the US president said that the BBC must retract the Panorama documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit for “no less” than $1bn (£760m), according to US media outlets who cited the letter. The BBC has confirmed it had received a letter and said it will respond in due course.</p>

      <p>
      <p>There’s movement in Washington toward ending the government shutdown. The Senate held a procedural vote yesterday. Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted yes with Republicans, which finally broke the logjam and will allow final votes on a bill to reopen the government. It's progress, but there's still potential for derailment. Plus, New Mexico is offering free universal child care starting this month. We'll hear what that means for one family.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Senate advances funding bill to end longest US government shutdown in history</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)

      <p>Amended package must be passed by the house and signed by the president. Plus, Volodymyr Zelenskyy on why he’s not afraid of Donald Trump</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Senate has made significant progress towards ending the longest US government shutdown in history, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill">narrowly advancing a compromise bill</a> to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.</p>
<p><strong>What did the Democrats say about the bill?</strong> “This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [resolution] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader.</p>
<p><strong>What has the IDF said in response?</strong> In a written statement, the IDF said it “remains committed to the rule of law and continues to operate in accordance with its legal and ethical obligations, despite the unprecedented operational complexity posed by Hamas’s systematic embedding within civilian infrastructure and its use of civilian sites for military purposes”.</p>

      <p>Employees providing assistance to recipients expressed fears on how lack of aid will affect those who need it most</p>
<p>When Stacy Smith, a government worker, showed up to work last Monday – the first working day after food benefits lapsed, amid the ongoing federal shutdown – she found a long line outside her office door. Elderly and disabled individuals desperately wanted answers.</p>
<p>Some had gone to buy groceries, not realizing that their usual benefits were unavailable.</p>

      <h1>From floored to flawed: Does anyone want to win the Super Bowl this season?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>The NFL is built on parity. But this season the NFC only has a few contenders while even the best teams in the AFC have worrying flaws</p>
<p>No league sells parity like the NFL: it’s the entire brand. But through 10 weeks of this season, this isn’t a league that is equally balanced between the good, the bad and the mediocre. It’s one where most of the league is simply <em>fine.</em></p>
<p>In the NFC, at least, there is some clarity. The Rams and Seahawks (both 7-2) look like the most complete teams in football, and secured blowout wins on Sunday. The 6-2 Eagles, despite their struggles, still have one of the most talented rosters in the league, likewise with the Packers (5-2-1). Even the Lions (6-3), who have been inconsistent along both lines of scrimmage and have been dealing with tension on their coaching staff, have proven they can hammer good teams. For all five, you can still easily put together a Super Bowl path.</p>

      <h1>Medicaid chief’s claim $1bn is spent on healthcare for ‘illegal immigrants’ is false, say experts</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>Mehmet Oz made claim about audits, but experts say he misidentified routine administrative errors</p>
<p>The administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, recently claimed that an audit revealed “more than $1bn of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants”, but experts say the audits were unrelated to immigration, and that rhetoric like this could make immigrant families – regardless of legal status – afraid to seek necessary medical care.</p>
<p>Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, noted that he had not “seen what this audit is”, but “based on the reporting, it appears that it is related to administrative errors in state claiming for matching funds, which is a relatively common occurrence, and which CMS monitors closely as they should”.</p>

      <h1>US president Donald Trump booed while attending Washington Commanders NFL game – video</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>Donald Trump became the first sitting US president in nearly 50 years to attend a regular-season NFL game when he dropped in on the Detroit Lions’ win over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/washington-commanders">Washington Commanders</a> on Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3m5a7te2sva2q">There were boos</a> from large sections of fans, as well as scattered cheers, at the Commanders’ Northwest Stadium when Trump was shown on the screens late in the first half – and again when the president was introduced by the stadium announcer at half-time. The Washington DC area has strong Democratic support, while Trump’s cuts to the government have affected many workers in the vicinity of the Commanders’ stadium. Sunday was not the first time Trump has received a hostile reception from a Washington sports crowd: he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/27/donald-trump-booed-world-series-lock-him-up-chants-baseball">greeted with ‘lock him up’ chants</a> at the Washington Nationals’ home stadium during the 2019 World Series.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">US Senate</a> on Sunday took a key vote on a bill that would end the record-setting federal government shutdown without extending the healthcare subsidies that Democrats have demanded.</p>
<p>Senators began voting on Sunday night to advance House-passed stopgap funding legislation that the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said would be amended to combine another short-term spending measure with a package of three full-year appropriations bills.</p>

<p>The growth in global demand for “green” office buildings has slowed after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/31/harrison-ford-donald-trump-climate-crisis">Donald Trump’s assault on environmental protection policies</a> caused a slump in interest in the US, according to a survey of construction industry professionals.</p>
<p>Building occupiers and investors across North America and South America expressed significantly lower growth in demand for green commercial buildings, a shift that “seems to be in response to a change in US policy focus”, according to a survey of members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Reported demand across the rest of the world also fell, albeit not as sharply.</p>

<p>Donald Trump became the first sitting US president in nearly 50 years to attend a regular-season NFL game when he dropped in on the Detroit Lions’ win over the Washington Commanders on Sunday.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acyn.bsky.social/post/3m5a7te2sva2q">There were boos</a> from large sections of fans, as well as scattered cheers, at the Commanders’ Northwest Stadium when Trump was shown on the screens late in the first half – and again when the president was introduced by the stadium announcer at halftime. The Washington DC area has strong Democratic support, while Trump’s cuts to the government have affected many workers in the vicinity of the Commanders’ stadium. Sunday was not the first time Trump has received a hostile reception from a Washington sports crowd: he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/27/donald-trump-booed-world-series-lock-him-up-chants-baseball">greeted with ‘lock him up’ chants</a> at the Washington Nationals’ home stadium during the 2019 World Series.</p>

<p>Tua Tagovailoa threw for 173 yards and two touchdowns, De’Von Achane added a pair of rushing scores and the Miami Dolphins beat the Buffalo Bills to end a seven-game losing streak against their AFC East rivals. The Bills (6-3) had not lost to Miami (3-7) since Week 3 of the 2022 season but came out flat on Sunday.</p>
<p>Achane finished with 225 scrimmage yards and fourth-quarter touchdowns of 59 and 35 yards. Tagovailoa completed 15 of 21 passes with two interceptions to give him a league-leading 12 picks this season. It was also the most dominant performance of the season for Miami’s defense, which had three takeaways and three sacks. Josh Allen threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, with an interception and fumble, but was replaced by Mitchell Trubisky after Achane’s second TD put the Dolphins up by 17 with three minutes left.</p>

The US president has apparently let it be known to the ownership group of the Washington Commanders that he wants the team’s new stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2030, to take his name. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” a senior White House official <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46892115/trump-wants-commanders-stadium-named-him">told ESPN</a>.</p>

      <p>Over 2,500 flights cancelled as transportation secretary says flight reductions could reach 20% if shutdown persists</p>
<p>Flight cancellations and delays are set to grow as airline passengers across the United States spent the weekend grappling with those <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown">issues</a> at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/list-airports-flight-cuts-faa">major airports</a> nationwide after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated a 4% reduction in air traffic in response to the ongoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">federal government shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>If the shutdown continues, the FAA has instructed airlines to cut 6% of flights on Tuesday – and to do the same to 10% by 14 November. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/american-airlines-warns-problems-faa-flight-cuts-increase-2025-11-07/">warned</a> that flight reductions could reach 20% if the shutdown persists, and on Sunday he predicted a “substantial” number of people in the US would be unable to celebrate the upcoming holidays with their families if the shutdown wasn’t resolved.</p>

      <p>A dangerous faith in AI is sweeping American healthcare – with consequences for the basis of society itself</p>
<p>The computer interrupted while Pamela was still speaking. I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers. Midway through her description of how she had been feeling, the doctor clicked his mouse and a block of text began to bloom across the computer monitor.</p>
<p>The clinic had adopted an artificial-intelligence scribe, and it was transcribing and summarizing the conversation in real time. It was also highlighting keywords, suggesting diagnostic possibilities and providing billing codes. The doctor, apparently satisfied that his computer had captured an adequate description of Pamela’s chief complaint and symptoms, turned away from us and began reviewing the text on the screen as Pamela kept speaking.</p>

It was late summer and the founderof <a href="https://www.peta.org.uk/">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (Peta) was flying from Minneapolis in the US to the company HQ in Norfolk, Virginia when her plane encountered strong wind shear. The pilot attempted an emergency landing, but failed; back up they went.</p>
<p>On the third attempt, with “a teaspoon of fuel” in the tank, he finally got the plane down safely. During those moments, Newkirk, now 76, scribbled a will on a napkin. She has tweaked it over the years, but it still reads like a horror movie prop list: her liver is to be sent to France to be made into foie gras, her skin to Hermès to create a handbag and her lips to whichever US president is in power, to shame them for granting a “patronising” pardon to a turkey each Thanksgiving. As wills go, it’s straight out of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/peta">Peta</a> playbook: an audacious stunt of the kind that has made them the world’s most well-known, successful and in some quarters reviled animal rights organisation. “I know I’ll never be made a dame,” Newkirk says, laughing. “I’m too controversial.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>White House is manipulating voting system, from redistricting to rule changes, to affect midterms</p>
<p>A year out from the 2026 midterms, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> feeling the blows from a string of losses in this week’s elections, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his allies are mounting a multipronged attack on almost every aspect of voting in the United States and raising what experts say are troubling questions about the future of one of the world’s oldest democracies.</p>
<p>While Democratic leaders continue to invest their hopes in a “ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/03/democrats-blue-wave-2026-midterms-00489291">blue wave</a>” to overturn Republican majorities in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> next year, Trump and some prominent supporters have sought to discredit the possibility that Republicans could lose in a fair fight and are using that premise to justify demands for a drastically different kind of electoral system.</p>

      <h1>How Mamdani is defying immigrant expectations by embracing his identity: ‘His boldness resonates’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-09)
      <p>
      <p>New York City mayor-elect refused to ‘be in the shadows’ in the face of Islamophobic attacks during his campaign</p>
<p>Across the country, Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants has shaken neighbourhoods, torn apart families and engendered a sense of panic among communities. But in New York, on Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani, the first Muslim mayor of New York, and an immigrant from Uganda, chose to underline his identity. “New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he told an ecstatic crowd at Paramount theater in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The son of a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, he was born in Kampala, raised in New York, and identifies as a democratic socialist. Almost every aspect of Mamdani’s identity had been an issue of contention during the election. Earlier this week, the Center for Study of Organized Hate published a report highlighting the surge in Islamophobic comments online between July and October, most of which labelled Mamdani as an extremist or terrorist.</p>

      <h1>America’s men’s grand slam drought is not Taylor Fritz’s burden to carry</h1>

(date: 2025-11-09)
      <p>
      <p>Back at the ATP finals one year after reaching the last hurdle, Fritz remains a top-five talent. It’s a reminder that a certain major-title drought is not his burden to bear</p>
<p>I would like to have some words with ESPN broadcaster Chris Fowler about what he said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/novak-djokovic-taylor-fritz-us-open-quarter-final-match-report">after Novak Djokovic beat Taylor Fritz</a>, for the 11th straight time, in the US Open quarter-finals. Look – Fritz is American, Fowler is American – and sports often lend themselves to nationalism. A little bit of disappointment was appropriate. Instead, Fowler invoked the continued drought of American men at the majors: none of them had lifted a trophy since Andy Roddick in 2003, and Fritz had been the last one standing in the tournament.</p>
<p>We all love a narrative, myself included. But come <em>on.</em> Even if Fritz had beaten Djokovic for the first time, force of nature Carlos Alcaraz was waiting in the next round, who Fritz has yet to beat in an official match. And if he’d somehow survived that, it would have been defending champion Jannik Sinner in the final, against whom Fritz had lost 10 of the last 11 sets. Alcaraz and Sinner had also split the last seven major titles (and Alcaraz went on to thrash a fatigued Djokovic in the next round). Fritz said in press after the loss that he actually liked his draw, because it presented the opportunity to beat the three best players in the world in succession. Fritz is more than within his right to aspire to the accomplishment; an athlete is meant to believe in themselves. But going into that Djokovic quarter-final who else in their right mind had the drought of American champions on the brain?</p>

<p>US senators are working through the weekend for the first time since the government shutdown began more than a month ago, but hopes for a bipartisan agreement on how to end the standoff, and keep healthcare affordable for millions of Americans, appeared to recede as Republican senators floated a proposal toxic to Democrats: scrapping the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare.</p>
<p>The impact on Americans from the longest shutdown of the federal government in history deepened on Saturday, as federal workers went unpaid, airlines were forced to cancel flights and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits have been delayed for 42 million Americans.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is pressing the NFL’s Washington Commanders to name their planned $3.7bn stadium after him, a bid he is pursuing through back-channel conversations with ownership and by leaning on the government bodies that must approve the project, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p>A senior White House official said Trump has conveyed his wishes directly to a member of investor Josh Harris’s ownership group. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” the official <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46892115/trump-wants-commanders-stadium-named-him">told ESPN</a>. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt added in an email: “That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”</p>

      <p>Democrat Sam Rasoul, a Muslim, won re-election to the state legislature despite accusations of antisemitism</p>
<p>Sam Rasoul, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrat</a> who is currently the longest-serving Muslim state lawmaker in the US and who faced accusations of antisemitism over language condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza as genocide, scored a resounding victory in Tuesday’s election that he believes shows voters are craving honesty from politicians.</p>
<p>Rasoul, an American Palestinian state legislator since 2014, strengthened his majority as he was re-elected to an area of Virginia where the city of Roanoke leans Democrat and the surrounding areas are deeply conservative. In an election seen as a referendum on Trump’s policies, which have disproportionately affected Virginia, Rasoul increased his vote share from four years ago by more than 5% as Democrats trounced Republicans from the legislature to the governor’s mansion.</p>

(date: 2025-11-08)
      <p>
      <p>Though Latino voters gave sweeping support to Democrats in Tuesday’s elections, they’re not a permanent coalition</p>
<p>Latino voters delivered sweeping support to Democratic candidates across multiple states in Tuesday’s off-year elections, reversing what many Republicans had come to believe was a lasting political realignment after Donald Trump’s historic gains with the community in the 2024 election .</p>
<p>The rapid reversal represents one of the most volatile electoral swings in recent memory and threatens to upend Republican redistricting strategies that banked on sustained support from Latinos, the fastest-growing voting bloc in the country. It also suggests that Trump’s appeal to Latino voters was highly personal rather than an embrace of the Republican party itself – a miscalculation that could reshape the landscape heading into the 2026 midterms.</p>

      <p>New York’s mayor-elect has taken on powerful institutions. With the World Cup taking place in his city, he should challenge Fifa next</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">winning the election</a> for mayor of New York City, an exuberant Zohran Mamdani took to the stage at his victory speech and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-victory-speech-transcript">said</a>, “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.” He was alluding to Donald Trump, but the sentiment also applies to Fifa, the world’s governing body for soccer.</p>
<p>In September, Mamdani’s team kicked off a “Game Over Greed” <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/gameovergreed">campaign</a> targeting Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for 2026 men’s World Cup tickets, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/zohran-mamdani-interview-fifa-petition-dynamic-pricing-football-weekly">calling</a> it an “affront to the game.” His petition demanded that Fifa cease its rapacious dynamic pricing scheme, place a price cap on tickets that are resold on Fifa’s ticketing platform, and reserve a tranche of tickets for local residents. Mamdani, a longtime Arsenal fan, told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2025/sep/11/manchester-united-city-derby-moldova-misery-zoran-mamdani-football-weekly-podcast">Guardian’s Football Weekly</a> podcast, “I have long been quite troubled by how the supposed stewards of the game have opted for profit time and time again at the expense of the people that love this game.”</p>

<p>The industry-funded group, called Americans for Ingredient Transparency (AFIT), suggests it is part of a grassroots Make America Healthy Again (Maha) movement, but opponents say it is waging a campaign on behalf of big food companies that Maha figures typically criticize – ConAgra, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Hormel and Nestlé, among other food giants.</p>

<p>It has been a year of soul-searching, hand-wringing, and self-flagellation for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> after a ballot-box rejection so thorough that some had come to believe that the party had lost not only the White House and Congress but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183075/did-democrats-lose-on-the-economy-or-the-culture-wars-three-strategists-weigh-in">the culture itself</a>.</p>
<p>Shell-shocked, Democrats entered Donald Trump’s second term in a political stupor – unsure of who they were or what they stood for.

      <p>After the ex-host of the ReidOut was forced out in February, she launched her own streaming show on YouTube</p>
<p>Joy Reid hosted the 7pm hour on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/msnbc">MSNBC</a> for nearly five years, providing a daily dose of progressive energy and verve that led into the network’s primetime programming. Then, in late February, Reid was suddenly forced out, and her show, The ReidOut, was cancelled as part of a broader programming shakeup at the network. Reid has since launched her own streaming show, The Joy Reid Show, and has a few things to say about the mainstream media she was once part of.</p>

<p>As the US government shutdown stretches on after becoming the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/government-shutdown-longest-history">longest in history</a>, influencers and content creators have stepped into improvised public-service roles by chronicling life without paychecks.</p>

<p>It came a game earlier, when two of the team’s second-tier players, Kike Hernández, who is from Puerto Rico, and Miguel Rojas, from Venezuela, pulled off a thrilling, game-winning sequence that simultaneously upended the many negative stereotypes Donald Trump has been touting about Latinos since he first ran for president a decade ago.</p>

<p>The United States has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from US sanctions for using Russian oil and gas, a White House official said on Friday, after Viktor Orbán pressed his case for a reprieve during a friendly meeting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in Washington.</p>

<p>Republicans rejected a proposal made on Friday by the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, which would end the longest government shutdown in US history by offering Republicans a deal to reauthorize funding in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.</p>
<p>“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes healthcare affordability,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Leader Thune just needs to add a clean, one-year extension of the ACA tax credits to the CR so that we can immediately address rising healthcare costs.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) is facing fierce questions after a video that appeared to show a man falling unconscious during an arrest while clutching a small child went viral, and officials accused the man of faking a medical emergency to stop the arrest of his wife.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-q83KCOZw">footage</a>, obtained by the Boston Globe, shows a frantic commotion inside a vehicle in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on Thursday. A desperate woman in the passenger seat tries to awaken the man in the driver’s seat, with a crying child in the middle.

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Consumer sentiment — as in, how everyday people feel about the economy — fell to a low not seen since 2022, according to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers. The decline was consistent across demographics, except among the wealthiest Americans (as measured by volume of stock market holdings). In other words, economic mood just became another k-shaped indicator.

      <p>Nobel prize winner shaped medicine, crimefighting and genealogy, but later years marred by racist remarks</p>
<p>James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.</p>
<p>The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.</p>

      <p>Aryna Sabalenka came through a gripping three-set battle with Amanda Anisimova and will face Elena Rybakina, who fought back to defeat Jessica Pegula in the first semi-final</p>
<p><strong>First set: Pegula 2-2* Rybakina (*denotes next server)</strong> Rybakina had started the stronger but lost her way in that last service game. Can Pegula back up the break? An early double fault doesn’t help matters, and Rybakina outlasts her in a rally to earn break point. From the middle of the court, Rybakina lands an inside-out forehand on the line, and we’re back on serve.</p>

<p>Students, faculty and staff at more than 100 campuses across the US rallied against the Trump administration’s assault on higher education on Friday – the first in a planned series of nationwide, coordinated protests that organizers hope will culminate in large-scale students’ and workers’ strikes next May Day and a nationwide general strike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/22/autoworkers-uaw-shawn-fain-may-2028-national-strike">in May 2028</a>.</p>
<p>The day of action was organized under the banner of Students Rise Up, a network of students including both local groups and national organizations such as Sunrise Movement and Campus Climate Network.

      <h1>NCAA bans six men’s basketball players for manipulating performances in betting scheme</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>Six NCAA players banned for prop-bet scheme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation found altered play, leaked info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follows earlier bans at Fresno St and SJSU</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men’s college basketball players for allegations of sports betting on Friday in three separate cases at New Orleans, Mississippi Valley and Arizona State.</p>
<p>The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an investigation that concluded Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short, Jamond Vincent, Donovan Sanders, Alvin Stredic and Chatton ‘BJ’ Freeman manipulated their performances to lose games, not cover betting lines, ensure certain prop bets were reached or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season.</p>
<p>In September, the NCAA also banned three college basketball players for betting on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State.</p>
<p>The violations at New Orleans against Hunter, Short and Vincent came to light after the NCAA received a tip about game manipulation. The NCAA said a student-athlete overheard the three players discuss a third party placing a bet on their game against McNeese State on 28 December 2024. New Orleans lost 86-61.</p>
<p>That same student-athlete reported that during a timeout near the end of the game, Short instructed him not to score any more points. New Orleans suspended all three student-athletes for the remainder of the season while it investigated the allegations.</p>
<p>The NCAA investigation showed that the three players manipulated their performances in seven games from December through January to lose by more points than the spread for that game.</p>
<p>The violations against Freeman were uncovered when the NCAA reviewed text messages involving Mykell Robinson, who played at Fresno State. Records on Robinson’s phone indicated that on four separate occasions between November and December 2024, Freeman knowingly provided information to Robinson, who was betting on Freeman through daily fantasy sports accounts.</p>
<p>Freeman also knowingly provided information on at least two occasions to his then-girlfriend, who was also betting on Freeman.</p>
<p>The NCAA said last month that it had been investigating at least 30 current or former players for gambling issues.</p>

      <h1>An Arizona town is dreading plans to turn its prison into an ICE facility: ‘It’s morally objectionable’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>In Marana, residents crowded into a town hall recently to learn the fate of a building that’s been closed for two years</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona">Arizona</a> town where farmers have long wrested a living off the arid land, reports that a former prison complex may be turned into an immigration detention center have sparked a fierce backlash, with residents seeing the potential transition as the latest undesirable symbol of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s massive escalation of immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The facility in Marana, a town of about <a href="https://www.maranaaz.gov/Departments/Economic-Development-and-Tourism/Demographics">63,700</a> people located north of Tucson, sprawls across a flat expanse of desert studded with scrubby bushes and hardy trees. It was shuttered almost two years ago, and the Management and Training Corporation, the private company that owns it, informed the town manager of company plans to operate a detention center in the prison.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that Stefanik has been working behind the scenes to secure endorsements from key Republican figures and local officials.

<p>The era of teen news media is seemingly withering, and that’s a big deal for teens — and adults. Earlier this week, Teen Vogue’s publisher, Condé Nast, announced that it would be folding the 22-year-old brand under the Vogue.com umbrella, calling it “a transition that’s part of a broader push to expand the Vogue ecosystem.”</p>

<p>Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, has spent nearly seven months in jail since he was arrested outside the Milwaukee county courthouse. He pleaded guilty in September to illegally re-entering the country after he reached a deal with prosecutors to not fight deportation.

      <h1>Trump pardons Tennessee Republican convicted of federal public corruption charges</h1>

      <p>Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff were accused of running scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has pardoned the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee">Tennessee</a> state house speaker and a one-time aide of public corruption charges after the White House said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a>’s justice department “significantly over-prosecuted” both for a minor issue.</p>
<p>Glen Casada, a former Republican state representative, was sentenced in September to three years in prison, and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, was also convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The case centered on their actions after both had been driven from their leadership roles and were accused of running a scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers.</p>

<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says it used professional marksmen to complete a cull of a large flock of ostriches in southern B.C. where avian flu was detected last December, ending a months-long legal battle between the agency and the birds' owners.</p>

It is one of a number of examples where the use of social media by White House officials has been viewed critically by judges overseeing cases.</p>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Starting today, the Federal Aviation Administration is requiring airlines to reduce flights at 40 airports because of the strain that air traffic controllers are under during what's turned into the longest federal government shutdown ever. Fewer flights mean reduced supply, just as demand is about to ramp up for the holidays. And there’s gonna be consequences for both airlines and consumers — including likely price increases. Plus, what constitutes a &quot;workplace emergency&quot; these days?</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Judge orders Trump administration to stop ‘needless suffering’ and fully fund food stamps</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Policy means ‘people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened’, says judge. Plus, Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Musk</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Rhode Island <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump">ordered the Trump administration</a> yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>What is the impact?</strong> After the administration said on Monday it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">only half</a> fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help">“One in eight people in our country right now</a> don’t have enough to eat.”</p>
<p><strong>What’s the shutdown latest?</strong> It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37">hold the line</a> to extract significant concessions.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> <strong>details do we know</strong> <strong>?</strong> The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>What impact could the move</strong> <strong>have?</strong> The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.</p>

      <h1>‘We’re sick of the OnlyFans model’: Stella Barey’s porn site lets gen Z sex workers have a life</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>The 28-year-old’s platform, Hidden, offers a Tumblr-like sensibility in an industry roiled by slop and lets adult content creators earn without burning out</p>
<p>Stella Barey has an hour for lunch. At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.</p>
<p>When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.</p>

<p>But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.</p>

      <p>After nearly 40 years in the Congress, the former House speaker is stepping down, reigniting interest in the race</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi’s announcement that, after nearly four decades in Congress, she will not seek re-election has reignited interest in the race for her long-held San Francisco seat.</p>
<p>The retirement of the former speaker of the House was long-anticipated, and two Democrats had already declared their intent to run. Saikat Chakrabarti, a former tech executive who previously served as the chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Scott Wiener, a state senator, kicked off their campaigns this year.</p>

<p>Comcast, the US telecoms company that own Sky and NBCUniversal, hopes to snap up ITV’s media and entertainment operations, which include its free-to-air TV channels in the UK and ITVX streaming platform.</p>

      <h1>Former Canada coach convicted of sexual assault not included on public sanctions lists</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>Bob Birarda, jailed in 2022 for assaulting players, is not listed by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer. The country’s new Safe Sport director says the omission exposes a major gap — and is calling for a global registry of banned coaches.</p>
<p>Two years after receiving an 18-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting players under his care, a former Canada women’s national team coach is yet to appear on any public sanctions list published by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer, the regional governing body for soccer in British Columbia, where the crimes took place.</p>
<p>The revelation has prompted the executive director of the Canadian organization newly appointed to manage reports of abuse and misconduct to call for an international registry of offenders to track individuals who have been banned from sports for misconduct.</p>

<p>The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.</p>
<p>The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.</p>

      <h1>WTA Finals tennis: Jessica Pegula beats Jasmine Paolini, Aryna Sabalenka v Coco Gauff – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Jessica Pegula hammered Jasmine Paolini before Aryna Sabalenka dismissed Coco Gauff, the two winners moving on to the semi-finals</p>
<p><strong>Paolini nets to go down 0-15 but soon makes 30-15, and a backhand swiped wide gives her game point.</strong> And though a decent return incites her to go wide, a decent first serve serve secures the hold. “It’s always good to get the first game under your belt,” revelates Tim Henman.</p>
<p><strong>Ready … play.</strong></p>

      <h1>Quantum computing: What's all the hype about?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Quantum computing is still in an experimental phase, but tech companies say it could eventually have an enormous impact on the global economy. How long is that going to take? On today’s show, science journalist Dan Garisto joins Kimberly to break down the basics of quantum computing and why it could take many years for the technology to move out of the lab and into the real world.</p>

<p>The longest government shutdown in history is now in its 37th day, though lawmakers, currently in talks, could be coming closer to a deal to end the standoff.</p>
<p>Some Democratic legislators, though, saw Tuesday’s big electoral wins as evidence they should hold the line and extract as much as possible from Republicans, most critically extending health insurance subsidies that, without intervention, will drastically increase costs for millions of Americans.</p>

      <p>Elyria-Swansea, a largely Latino neighborhood in Denver, has plenty of industrial sources for air pollution: a dog food factory, an oil refinery, a highway. Now, an AI data center is being constructed and threatens to contribute to the area's poor air quality. How are community residents responding?

      <p>US government shutdown blamed for cuts from Friday, two weeks before busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period</p>

</ul>
<p>New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341">government shutdown</a>, according to a list distributed to the airlines.</p>
<p>The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.</p>
<p>This article was amended on 6 November 2025. A previous version said the US government was in its 35th day of shutdown. The correct current number is 37 days.</p>

<p>Gio Reyna and Joe Scally will make their US men’s national team returns in the upcoming international window, while Christian Pulisic is among several regulars set to miss out. But while the Milan midfielder has just recovered from an injury suffered during his most recent time with the national team, Weston McKennie’s absence is a bit more surprising.</p>
<p>Reyna and Scally, both of Borussia Mönchengladbach, are among a 25-player squad named by manager Mauricio Pochettino for two friendlies: against Paraguay on 15 November at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, and against Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on 18 November.</p>

      <p>Nancy Pelosi, a California Democratic representative and the first woman to serve as speaker, has announced she will retire from Congress, two years after stepping down from House leadership. She made the announcement in a video that reflects on her successful political career. The decision marks the close of a 20-term congressional career in which Pelosi rose to the apex of American politics. A force on Capitol Hill for decades, she was a central figure in the major legislative accomplishments of Barack Obama and Joe Biden’s presidencies</p>

      <h1>Europeans recognize Zohran Mamdani’s supposedly radical policies as ‘normal’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Critics of New York City’s mayor-elect have said his pledges of free bus service and universal childcare are unrealistic, but in Europe it’s a given</p>
<p>After New York City’s race for mayor catapulted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> from state assembly member into one of the world’s most prominent progressive voices, intense debate swirled over the ideas at the heart of his campaign.</p>
<p>His critics and opponents painted pledges such as free bus service, universal childcare and rent freezes as unworkable, unrealistic and exorbitantly expensive.</p>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>Yesterday, Supreme Court justices heard arguments and asked questions about whether an emergency powers law could be used by a president to overhaul international trade and bring in lots of money through import taxes — all without getting Congress to go along. The justices were skeptical, to say the least. We'll discuss. Plus, we'll hear how suspended SNAP benefits are playing out at one food bank in Central California.</p>

      <p>Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage</p>
<p>California voters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result">overwhelmingly approved</a> a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/02/us-redistrcting-congressional-map">all-out sprint to rejigger</a> district lines ahead of next year’s midterms.</p>
<p>California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/01/texas-republicans-congressional-redistricting-trump">passed a map</a> that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. The new California map neuters that effort by adding the same number of Democratic seats.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/bill-gates-climate-crisis-pivot">new memo</a> on the climate crisis from Bill Gates relies on “straw man” arguments about the threat to humanity and “false dichotomies” between spending on climate or aid for the poor, some climate scientists say.</p>
<p>Published last week, the tech billionaire’s 17-page missive called for a “strategic pivot” away from focusing on slashing emissions and towards preventing poverty and suffering. It was quickly picked up by some on the right, including Donald Trump, who hailed it as a much-needed backpedaling on climate efforts.</p>

Then, China has announced it's easing tariffs and export controls on U.S. firms following last week's seemingly productive meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.

<p>Supporters of abortion rights have spent much of the last year trying to fight Donald Trump’s attempts to undermine access to the procedure. Now, Democrats’ commanding victories in the 2025 elections have breathed new life into the fight.</p>
<p>Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill’s respective gubernatorial victories in Virginia and New Jersey will shield abortion rights in two states that have become havens for people fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, voters decided to retain three liberal supreme court justices, maintaining Democratic control of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/state-supreme-court-abortion-ballot">bench that could decide the future of abortion rights</a> in the deeply purple state.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say">still a chance for the world to avoid</a> the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.</p>
<p><strong>How do things stand?</strong> For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time">1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels</a> set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.</p>
<p><strong>What has Brazil’s president said</strong> <strong>?</strong> “This [summit] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/brazil-cop-30-truth-world-leaders-climate-crisis-president-lula">wrote for the Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the case about?</strong> Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the court sides against the president?</strong> It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.</p>

<p>The US is ending temporary deportation protection for South Sudanese nationals, which for more than a decade allowed people from the east African country to stay in the US after escaping conflict.</p>

The agency said South Sudanese nationals with status through the programme had 60 days to leave the US or face deportation.</p>

<p>In a short while, we’ll hear from <strong>Donald Trump</strong> when he hosts a breakfast with Republican senators at the White House. As we noted earlier, the president had choice words about Mamdani’s victory in New York, and other Democratic wins across the country – including the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Gerardo ‘Jerry’ Estrada, 30, was hit head-on by weaving car with sirens on that had drifted from correct side of street</p>
<p>The Los Angeles police department has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-04/lapd-skateboarder-fatal-crash">released disturbing dashcam footage</a> of its officers weaving in and out of traffic before fatally striking a skateboarder.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAX9mJPx6tA">video</a> of the 19 September collision shows an LAPD cruiser, with its sirens on at around 7.15pm, at times driving on the wrong side of the road to get past cars. While the driver and another officer appeared to be engaged in a casual conversation, they drifted from the correct side of the street into a center lane, at which point the skateboarder appeared in view.</p>

<p>A federal investigator said a UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly before it crashed and exploded into a huge fireball in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday night, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.</p>
<p>At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents arrived at the site and began searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/louisville-plane-crash-airport-kentucky-latest">crash shortly after takeoff</a> at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.</p>

      <h1>Trump voters for Mamdani and a new left coalition: the biggest surprises from New York’s election</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>Political analyst Michael Lange, a born and raised New Yorker who predicted Zohran Mamdani would win, discusses election night’s trends and surprises</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-new-york-nyc-donald-trump-mayor-election-california-new-jersey-virginia-latest-news-results">US politics live – latest updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Two days before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> mayoral election, Michael Lange made a <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-177872464">big electoral prediction</a> – not just of who would win overall, or in each borough or neighborhood, but block by block. Lange, a political analyst born and raised in New York City, has spent over a decade in progressive politics and has become something of a local celebrity this year for his deep dives into city data and polling.</p>
<p>He published his highly detailed prediction map – which correctly forecast that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> would win although failed to predict <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>’s strong performance – on his Substack, <a href="https://www.michaellange.nyc/">the Narrative War</a>. Lange has a flair for witty coinages. He highlighted, for instance, the divide between the “commie corridor”, stretching from Park Slope to Bushwick to Astoria, where he predicted (accurately) that Mamdani would win by huge margins, and the “capitalist corridor” on Manhattan’s Upper East and Upper West Sides. There, “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/ng-interactive/2025/sep/10/bari-weiss-cbs">Free Press</a> and Wall Street Journal outrank the New York Times” in readership and most voters leaned toward Cuomo, who ran as a conservative-courting independent.</p>

At 30-all, Alexandrova returns with a stonking forehand winner: break point. Rybakina’s whippy backhand makes it deuce … and she saves another break point to hold.</p>
<p><strong>*Alexandrova 3-2 Rybakina (* denotes server):</strong> Rybakina attacks Alexandrova’s second serve, coming inside to hit a deep forehand return that makes it 15-30. The former steps into a backhand winner to make it 30-40, but Alexandrova resists, closing the game with an ace.</p>

<p>Republicans in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging a high-stakes redistricting measure that could help flip up to five congressional seats for Democrats.</p>
<p>The suit, filed by David Tangipa, a Republican assembly member, 18 California voters and the state Republican party in the US district court for the central district of California, argues that the new maps are unconstitutional because they were drawn to increase the voting power of a particular racial group. It asks the court to block the new maps from taking effect, at least temporarily.</p>

      <p>
      <p>From military-level force in cities to tens of thousands of federal workers fired by the Trump administration, effects have been felt at every level</p>
<p>Last year, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> campaign promises and policy proposals became increasingly clear, the Guardian published a series called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-stakes">The Stakes</a> to outline the impact the administration would likely have on the country. The stories were broken down by subject matter – spanning civil rights, health, immigration and cities.</p>
<p>Much of what was covered in the series has played out on American streets and inside homes since Trump was inaugurated in January. From military-level force used in urban centers, to tens of thousands of federal workers fired by the administration, the effects have been felt at every level.</p>

      <h1>New York parties for Zohran Mamdani: ‘The first time we’ve had hope in so long’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>In the bodegas, bars and clubs of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, the mood was joyous – it was an emotional night</p>
<p>Inside an election watch party hosted by the Democratic Socialists of America at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple in Fort Greene, under the din of pet-nat wines being cracked open, there was a sense of nervous anticipation. “I’m not sure if this is an accurate recreation of Solomon’s Temple,” said one supporter in a Zohran Mamdani T-shirt. “This is like a who’s who of everyone I’ve slept with,” said another.</p>
<p>The suspense didn’t last long. Just after 9.30pm, someone jumped on the mic to announce that news outlets had called it: a record number of New Yorkers had cast ballots in this electric – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/zohran-mamdani-attacks-racism-islamophobia-">often ugly</a> – race between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">ultimately choosing</a> the 34-year-old democratic socialist of seemingly boundless energy who had shocked party establishment in the primary by winning on a clear-eyed affordability agenda. The DJ immediately started playing I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas. And, indeed, tonight was a good, good night for those in the room, who erupted in tears, hugs and twerking.</p>

      <p>Federal judge concerned that justice department sought to ‘indict first and investigate later’ in case of ex-FBI director</p>
<p>A federal judge on Wednesday ordered prosecutors in the criminal case of the former FBI director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey">James Comey</a> to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, saying he was concerned that the justice department’s position had been to “indict first and investigate later”.</p>
<p>Magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of the day on Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized during the investigation. The order followed arguments in which Comey’s attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago.</p>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>

      <p>
      <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments today on whether President Donald Trump can use emergency powers to levy tariffs. The law in question doesn’t mention tariffs, but the president also has wide latitude in setting the foreign-policy agenda. Let's dig into both sides' arguments. Plus, China's government is hosting a big trade show, and auto sales fall into a pot hole with EV subsidies gone.</p>

      <p>New York traded away two of their best players in an extraordinary few hours. But they could finally have made a decision that makes sense</p>
<p>It’s rare to see a franchise accept what everyone else already knows – that what they’ve built isn’t working. The Jets didn’t just tweak their roster at the deadline; they detonated it. In a dizzying few hours, they dealt cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Shein is making headlines for more than its new brick-and-mortar store in Paris’s famed BHV department store. But the launch has been overshadowed by French authorities’ investigation into disturbing, illegal products sold on the platform, as well as on Temu, AliExpress, and Wish. Today, we'll learn more. And some people in Thailand are relying on informal money lenders to cover the bills as consumer debt levels soar. We'll examine the deeper costs.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">elected as the 111th mayor of New York City</a>, defeating the former governor Andrew Cuomo and the Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.</p>
<p><strong>How did the New York vote go?</strong> Mamdani received more votes than all the other candidates combined. With 97% of votes counted, he was on 50.4% of the total, while Cuomo was on 41.6% and Sliwa on 7.1%.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean for the city?</strong> Mamdani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/wednesday-briefing-improbable-victory-for-citys-first-muslim-mayor-offers-new-playbook-for-fight-against-trump">wants to</a> freeze rent for 2 million people, to raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour, increase taxes on the highest earners, make bus transit free, offer universal childcare and increase affordable housing provision, among other things. The question now is how much of that platform he can deliver.</p>

<p>US government investigations into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-universities">universities</a> over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/antisemitism">antisemitism</a> allegations surged following the 7 October 2023 attacks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>’s subsequent war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, with more investigations open in the last two months of that year than in the two decades prior, according to a report published on Monday that was shared exclusively with the Guardian.</p>
<p>The data, compiled by the Middle East Studies Association and the American Association of University Professors and relying on publicly available records, offers a detailed account of how landmark civil rights legislation – and particularly Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act – has become a primary tool to restrict speech on campus.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A broken wrist and time away from the sport helped Kate Courtney find new purpose – and the freedom that led to another world title</p>
<p>In early September, Kate Courtney lined up at the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships for the 12th time in her career, but the first time targeting the marathon distance. A figure at the front of the pack in the shorter cross country and short track distances, Courtney would surprise everyone by winning the 77-mile race, claiming the second rainbow jersey of her nearly decade-long career.</p>
<p>“The competition at the sharp end is so high and the course was brutal, so I was productively intimidated,” said the 30-year-old Courtney, “I didn’t think much about the pressure of winning, which let me just focus on myself.”</p>

      <p>Zohran Mamdani supporters said they were 'elated' and 'hopeful' after the Democratic candidate was elected as the new mayor of New York City. Mamdani's socialist campaign promising to freeze rent and make buses free seduced New Yorkers who voted for him en masse, securing victory for him with more than 50% of the vote.

      <p>In today’s newsletter: With more than 50% of the vote, Mamdani tells supporters: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light”</p>
<p>Good morning. A few hours ago, Zohran Mamdani was declared <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city">the winner of the New York City mayoral election</a> with more than 50% of the vote on the biggest turnout since the 1960s. A rank outsider when the race started, he will become the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. And as an avowed socialist who has emerged as a national symbol of opposition to Donald Trump, he has given progressive Democrats something they believe is worth fighting for.</p>
<p>It was a good night all over for Democrats, who won governorships <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger">in Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/new-jersey-election-result-mikie-sherrill-wins-governor-race">New Jersey</a> and saw voters in California support <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result">a redistricting plan</a> designed to counter Republican efforts to redraw the map to their advantage in red states. But Republicans believe Mamdani is a gift for them, too: in frequently racist attacks on his candidacy, they have tarred him as a “Jihadist”, a communist and claimed he represents a new extremity on the left.</p>

      <p>Jamie Raskin in a letter questioned why justice department abruptly ended investigation into Epstein co-conspirators</p>
<p>A top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrat</a> has demanded to know why the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> “inexplicably killed” a criminal investigation into the late convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s alleged co-conspirators as he accused the justice department of a “shameful and gigantic cover-up”.</p>
<p>Jamie Raskin, a House judiciary committee ranking member and congressman from Maryland, claimed the decision to end the investigation in July had shielded an alleged network of “powerful individuals accused of enabling and engaging in the massive billion-dollar sex trafficking operation” while ignoring the accounts of women exploited by Epstein.</p>

<p>Weeks before one of America’s best-known businessmen, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, was sworn in as president on an overcast day in Washington DC, a different politician with a similarly familiar name took her oath of office elsewhere in the Capitol.</p>

<p>Dick Cheney, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies">who has died aged 84</a>, came to be seen as a moderate in his later years for his staunch opposition to Donald Trump, but he also stands accused of paving the way for Trumpism by undermining the independence of the intelligence agencies and US adherence to international law.</p>
<p>As George W Bush’s second-in-command in the “war on terror” declared after the 9/11 attacks, Cheney made himself one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, and was a key protagonist in the push to invade Iraq, as well as the use of torture on suspected al-Qaida members detained without charge in the CIA’s offshore “black sites”.</p>

      <h1>WTA Finals tennis: Sabalenka fends off Pegula; Gauff beats ailing Paolini – as it happened</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Aryna Sabalenka dug deep to beat Jessica Pegula 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 while Coco Gauff cleaned up her service game to win 6-3, 6-2 against Jasmine Paolini</p>
<p><strong>Gauff 3-1 Paolini* (* denotes server):</strong> Gauff nets two backhands in a row as the Italian plays her first ball with a bit more power than in the first three games. But Guaff uses the court to make Paolini chase the ball at the baseline and gets to deuce after a weak second serve from the Italian. The two trade advantages for a while and at the fifth deuce, Gauff nets a backhand return. Paolini finally sees out the 8min 58sec game after Gauff sends one long.</p>
<p><strong>*Gauff 3-0 Paolini (* denotes server):</strong> A long rally ends with the Italian powerfully slicing a winner and following it up with another crosscourt forehand that Gauff strains to reach. But she sends three returns long in back-to-back break points, putting her arms up in the air in frustration. Gauff gets the advantage and turns the game around to take the set after another poor return from Paolini, this one going into the stands.</p>

<p>Californians headed to the polls on Tuesday to decide on Proposition 50, a ballot measure of national significance that could play a major role in determining which party controls the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House of Representatives</a> after the 2026 midterms.</p>
<p>If voters approve the proposal, the state will halt the work of its independent redistricting commission and allow the legislature to redraw congressional districts to carve out five additional Democratic congressional seats.

Also: potential changes to public service loan forgiveness and a speech by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.</p>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Leaders from Bush to Barrasso paid tribute to the former vice-president, whose career drew praise and controversy</p>
<p>US political leaders offered their condolences in reaction to the news that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dick-cheney">Dick Cheney</a> had died, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-bush">George W Bush</a> describing his former vice-president as “a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges”.</p>
<p>Bush wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/MikeEmanuelFox/status/1985703848648876450">statement</a> that he would remember Cheney “for the decent honorable man that he was” and that history would remember him “as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence and seriousness of purpose to every position he held”.</p>

      <h1>Judge considers Democratic challenge to Trump troop deployment in Memphis</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>City government declines to raise objection in court but state leaders and ACLU seek to block deployment of troops</p>
<p>A state court in Nashville on Monday heard a legal challenge by some Democratic elected officials to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s deployment of the national guard into the streets of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/memphis">Memphis</a>, notable in part because of who has not raised an objection: the city of Memphis itself.</p>
<p>Shelby county’s mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats. Other state and local leaders joined the suit, including one Memphis city council member. The ACLU later filed briefs in support of the suit seeking an injunction to block the deployment of troops.</p>

      <h1>Could a win on California’s Prop 50 aid Gavin Newsom’s presidential hopes?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>The ballot measure win would be a significant political gain for the Golden state governor eyeing the White House</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom, the California governor, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/california-prop-50-democrats-trump">on the verge</a> of a political victory that, just a few months ago, didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In August, a group of Texas Democrats fled their state to block Republicans from approving a rare mid-decade gerrymander to redraw congressional districts at Donald Trump’s urging. Altering the maps in the GOP’s favor would make it even harder for Democrats to take back control of Congress in the midterm elections next year. The Texas Democrats hoped their standoff would be a national call to action.</p>

      <p>Right-back discusses Emma Hayes’s tactical messages, new blood in the national team and how Champions League win changed her</p>
<p>Emily Fox made her 68th appearance for the United States in the first of two recent friendlies against Portugal and the Arsenal right-back has been a steady hand for Emma Hayes.</p>
<p>Hayes has her eye on the 2027 World Cup after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/10/usa-brazil-olympic-womens-football-final-result-emma-hayes">winning Olympic gold</a> 15 months ago, and has used 2025 to evolve and evaluate the pool of players. Over the course of 10 wins and three defeats in that timeframe, Fox has been a dynamic force difficult to dislodge from the right flank of a new project. Her speed and skill are essential to the team’s defence and intrinsic to their attack.</p>

      <h1>How shifting tariff policy hits one Pennsylvania business</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Oral arguments over the Trump administration's &quot;reciprocal tariffs&quot; are set for tomorrow, in a test over limits to a president's power to act without Congress. Whichever way the high court decides, however, the co-founder of True Places, a Pennsylvania-based folding camp chair company, thinks that likely won't be the end of the tariff rollercoaster. Plus, Norway's massive sovereign wealth fund has voted against Elon Musk’s pay package from Tesla. Why?</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s intense pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge key foes with crimes based on dubious evidence and his ongoing investigations of other political enemies is hurting the rule of law in the US and violating departmental policies, which scholars and ex-prosecutors say may help scuttle some charges.</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">suspending</a> Snap altogether.</p>
<p><strong>What impact will it have?</strong> There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions">spoke to people</a> affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.</p>
<p><strong>Can Trump even do that?</strong> The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo">legal contention</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What do New York polls say?</strong> A recent survey from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html">AtlasIntel</a> showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court takes on a major case on Wednesday when it decides if President Donald Trump has the authority to use a law usually cited in emergencies for the imposition of tariffs on other countries. While they may not be as blunt as the law Trump has cited, there are a handful of other laws the president can cite to utilize tariffs for leverage and revenue.</p>

<p>Victor Conte, the architect of a scheme to provide undetectable performance-enhancing drugs to professional athletes including the baseball stars Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi and the Olympic track champion Marion Jones decades ago, has died. He was 75.</p>
<p>The federal government’s investigation into a company Conte founded, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (Balco), yielded the convictions of Jones, the elite sprint cyclist Tammy Thomas and the former NFL defensive lineman Dana Stubblefield, along with coaches, distributors, a trainer, a chemist and a lawyer.</p>

      <h1>The trouble with US veterans benefits isn’t ‘rampant’ fraud – it’s bureaucratic roadblocks, advocates say</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting</p>
<p>In October, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post">Washington Post</a> reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.</p>
<p>“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/">reported</a>.</p>

      <h1>Democrats fight to rebuild in key state races on election day</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>With polls showing signs of recovery after a popularity slump, Tuesday’s results will test whether the party can regain voters’ trust</p>
<p>One year after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.</p>
<p>With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.</p>

      <h1>Andrew Wiggins: how a shy NBA player negotiated growing up a star in the social media era</h1>

(date: 2025-11-04)
      <p>
      <p>In an extract from his new book on the rise of Canadian basketball, Oren Weisfeld examines the pressures of being a teenage star in the modern game</p>
<p>Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.</p>
<p>After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.</p>
<p><em>This is an edited extract from The Golden Generation: How Canada Became a Basketball Powerhouse by Oren Weisfeld. It’s published by ECW Press for $19.95 (USD) wherever you get your books.</em></p>

<p>Dallas fall to 3-5-1 as Arizona move to 3-5 with win</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jacoby Brissett had a stock answer ready for the question of whether the Arizona quarterback has done enough to be the replacement, not just the fill-in, for Kyler Murray. The coach, Jonathan Gannon, barely had an answer at all. The Cardinals will worry about what appears to be a full-blown controversy later. For now, they will enjoy ending a five-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Brissett threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score in another game with Murray sidelined by a foot injury, and the Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys 27-17 on Monday night. Brissett made his third consecutive start after the week began with expectations of Murray returning coming off the team’s open week.</p>

<p>Voters in New York City could make history Tuesday night by electing their first Muslim mayor. Polls have suggested Zohran Mamdani has a lead over Andrew Cuomo, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to withhold federal funds from the city. Here's a guide to the election.</p>

<p>Former workers of a joint venture between the government of Cuba and Canadian mining company Sherritt International say they were victims of a wage confiscation scheme that left them to live on just a fraction of their nominal salaries. They also say they were forced to attend Communist Party meetings and provide reports on all interactions with their Canadian colleagues.</p>

<p>As a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to, for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history, cut off benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (Snap). A federal judge last week prevented the US Department of Agriculture from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">suspending Snap altogether</a>, but the Trump administration now says enrollees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">will receive only half</a> of their usual benefits.</p>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been court ordered to partially fund this month’s SNAP benefits, after refusing to step in during the shutdown. Emergency USDA funds will cover about half of the $8 billion spent each month on the food assistance program. But it’s unclear how long households could wait for the partial benefits to kick in.

<p>Looking ahead, on Wednesday, <strong>the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.</strong> It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.</p>
<p>My colleague, <strong>Eduardo Porter</strong>, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.</p>
<p>Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf">levy a tariff</a> – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.</p>
<p>IEEPA <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701">gives the president</a> authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.</p>

      <p>A video that went viral captured Sean Charles Dunn hurling his sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside a nightclub</p>
<p>Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> law-enforcement surge in the nation’s capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington DC residents that Dunn simply broke the law.</p>
<p>That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Trump’s federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before the office of Jeanine Pirro, a US attorney, opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.</p>

      <p>The climate crisis is causing the permafrost to melt in Alaska, forcing the village of Nunapitchuk to relocate</p>
<p>Children splash gleefully in the river as adults cast fishing lines or head into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska">Alaska</a> tundra to hunt. It’s a scene that has characterized summer days for centuries among the Yup’ik people who have long lived in south-western Alaska, where the village of Nunapitchuk stands. But, with temperatures in Alaska warming nearly four times faster than most parts of the globe, that way of life is about to change.</p>
<p>Homes in Nunapitchuk have been sinking into the <a href="https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/frozen-ground-permafrost">permafrost</a>, and residents have decided their only choice is to move the entire village to higher ground.</p>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>That's the question before the Supreme Court this week. President Donald Trump has been declaring an emergency and then using emergency authority to impose many of these tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is among those who've said they expect to prevail in the high court, but if they don't, there are other ways to apply taxes on goods from other countries. Also: BP shale asset sales and a dark side of the drug rehab industry.</p>

      <p>Platner’s populist campaign faces backlash over past comments and a contentious tattoo</p>
<p>On a recent Monday night, Graham Platner – oysterman, army veteran and Democratic hopeful for US Senate – took the stage in a small <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> town known for its oyster farming to assure voters that he was still in the game to win the Democratic primary, and ultimately unseat five-term Republican incumbent Susan Collins.</p>
<p>He addressed a crowd of 700, the most that could fit into the school gymnasium in Damariscotta, Maine before organizers had to start turning people away. As is typical for his campaign events, the gruff, plain-talking, flannel-clad, local business owner and former marine dissected the “establishment political system that serves the interests of the ultra wealthy” in front of a captivated audience.</p>

      <p>This past weekend, as the shutdown stretches on, funds for SNAP benefits began to dry up. The Treasury Secretary says payments could restart this week, and a federal court said the Trump administration must tap into emergency funds to get this done. Today, we'll check in with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance for a snapshot of food insecurity there. Plus, Trump says he wants to fix Obamacare, and U.S. auto production could be hampered by a looming chip shortage.</p>

      <h1>Top FDA official quits amid inquiry into ‘serious concerns’ over his conduct</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Lawsuit claims George Tidmarsh, head of FDA drug center, waged personal vendetta against pharmaceutical executive</p>
<p>The head of the US Food and Drug Administration’s drug center abruptly resigned on Sunday after federal officials began reviewing “serious concerns about his personal conduct”, according to a government spokesperson.</p>
<p>Dr George Tidmarsh, who was named to the FDA post in July, was placed on leave on Friday after officials in the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) office of general counsel were notified of the issues, the HHS press secretary, Emily Hilliard, said in an email. Tidmarsh then resigned on Sunday morning.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Oxfam says Trump policies risk driving inequality to new heights while noting Democrats have also exacerbated wealth gap. Plus, why Salman Rushdie’s therapist has called him a ‘badass’</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The collective wealth of the top 10 US billionaires has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/wealth-billionaires-increase-trump">soared by $698bn in the past year</a>, according to a report from Oxfam America on the growing wealth divide.</p>
<p><strong>How have Trump’s policies affected the figures?</strong> Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in May, has been one of the “single largest transfers of wealth upwards in decades”, according to the report, by cutting tax for the wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The system, which launched more than a year ago, rewards soldiers who achieve strikes with points that can be exchanged to buy more weapons in an “Amazon-for-war” online store called Brave1 filled with more than 100 different drones, autonomous vehicles and other drone war material.</p>

      <p>The president’s wife is reported to have ‘privately raised concerns about’ the destruction of the White House East Wing. If so, they were ignored</p>
<p>From Eleanor Roosevelt to Melania Trump, the East Wing of the White House served as a base for first ladies.

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is serving 25 years in federal prison for fraud. His company collapsed and went bankrupt in 2022. Investigators found that billions of dollars in customer funds had been borrowed without permission to help shore up Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.</p>
<p>But throughout the last three years, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence, and he's filed an appeal. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Jonathan Jones, a reporter and producer for the investigative podcast “Reveal,” who spent hours talking to the former CEO, FTX insiders and customers.</p>

      <h1>At the World Series the Blue Jays belonged to Canada – and large parts of the US too</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>One baseball win was never going to bind Canada – and sympathetic fans south of the border – together for ever. But it was sweet while it lasted</p>
<p>The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.</p>
<p>This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball">a heartbreaking Game 7</a>, missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.</p>

      <h1>The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad game</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Buffalo extended their regular season domination over Kansas City. But they know that the playoffs are another matter altogether</p>
<p>Of course Josh Allen didn’t take a breath in the final seconds of the latest Chiefs-Bills classic. “You never know with Pat [Mahomes],” Allen told reporters after Buffalo eked out a 28-21 win on Sunday. Bills kicker Matt Prater had earlier missed a 52-yard field goal with 27 seconds remaining that would have sealed the win for Buffalo. Even the miss was dramatic, with Prater doinking his kick off the right upright. Allen wasn’t alone in thinking Mahomes could lead the Chiefs 58 yards down the field with 22 seconds left and no time outs. One Chiefs fan in Buffalo certainly <a href="https://x.com/TrainwreckSprts/status/1985030484615721042">reminded the home crowd</a> of Buffalo’s 2021 divisional round collapse in which Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill and then Travis Kelce with 13 seconds remaining to set up a game-tying field goal and eventual overtime win.</p>
<p>Are these two teams capable of a producing a boring contest when they meet? Sunday had looked like it would go down that route, given the statement made by Buffalo’s defense, before the Chiefs threatened a comeback in the fourth quarter. The Bills had responded to questions about their depleted defense by stymying Mahomes for most of the game. This <a href="https://x.com/NFL/status/1985126243839488080">sandwich sack</a> by Greg Rousseau and Michael Hoecht showed the tenacity of Buffalo’s defensive line. They needed it: Mahomes converted on fourth and 17 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, a reminder that no matter the situation, he is always capable of tormenting the Bills.</p>

      <h1>Talking Horses | Willie Mullins eyes Melbourne and Breeders’ Cup double after shock triumph</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>The dominant jumps racing trainer has another huge Flat prize in sight after Ethical Diamond’s sparkling success</p>
<p>If five wins from the seven turf events, one short of the record, felt like a standard return for European runners at the 2025 Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar, then the identity of the biggest winner of all was a huge, and very refreshing, surprise.</p>
<p>Willie Mullins blew into Del Mar with Ethical Diamond, his first ever runner at the meeting, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/01/breeders-cup-2025-day-two-live">left with the $2m first prize in the Turf</a>, nearly five times as much as he banked when Nick Rockett landed the Grand National in April. And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/ethical-diamond-shines-bright-to-hand-william-buick-a-first-success-in-the-ebor">Ebor Handicap winner</a> leave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.</p>

      <p>House speaker says president has ‘tried everything he can’ even while Trump delays food benefits to millions</p>
<p>Top Republicans are portraying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> as a “big-hearted president” who is desperate to reopen the US government, even as he delays food assistance funding for millions of low-income Americans but steams ahead with construction of his $300m gilded White House ballroom.</p>
<p>As the government shutdown entered its 33rd day, the Republican speaker of the House, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-johnson">Mike Johnson</a>, presented Trump as a man angry and desperate to break the impasse so as to ease mounting pain for ordinary Americans. “He’s just desperate for the government to open, he’s tried everything he can,” Johnson said, adding that Trump was a “big-hearted president, he wants everybody to get their services”.</p>

<p>For 40-year-old Cecilia Romero, the days before and after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween">Halloween</a> are not just any other holiday. It’s the time of year when she can take her kids trick-or-treating in the neighborhood she’s from – and a connection to her own past when she would go celebrate as a little girl.</p>
<p>She remembers years of streets brimming with families and children, with street vendors selling food and cempasúchil, the marigolds that loved ones place on altars for Day of the Dead – or Día de los Muertos – from 1 to 2 November.</p>

      <h1>John F Kennedy grandson says Julia Fox’s bloody Jackie Halloween costume ‘disgusting’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>Jack Schlossberg says ‘dangerous’ to evoke grandfather’s assassination; Fox says it’s a ‘statement’ of Jackie’s ‘bravery’</p>
<p>Political writer and commentator Jack Schlossberg has said it was “disgusting, desperate and dangerous” for actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/julia-fox">Julia Fox</a> to wear a Halloween costume evoking the assassination of president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy">John F Kennedy</a>, his grandfather.</p>
<p>Fox, however, has defended her controversial decision to wear a replica of the blood-stained, pink suit that former first lady Jackie Kennedy was seen wearing when her husband was shot dead by a sniper while the couple rode in a motorcade in Dallas in 1963. The Uncut Gems star has said she dressed as Jackie Kennedy as “a statement” about the poise and “extraordinary bravery” she showed when subjected to unimaginable “brutality”.</p>

      <h1>If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>The repeat champions’ vast wealth means they can stockpile talent unimaginable to other teams. But it’s undeniable that the results are hugely entertaining</p>
<p>A unicorn led off the game with a single and then trotted out to the mound to pitch the bottom of the first. Another pitcher won Games 2, 6, and 7 of the World Series, throwing 17.2 innings along the way. A catcher set a record, squatting behind the plate for 74 Fall Classic frames and ultimately ended the series by hitting the final go-ahead home run.</p>
<p>Just as everyone feared or sneered, the Los Angeles Dodgers are champions. Again. In what some forecasted as a harbinger of doom, the sinister strategy of employing the best baseball player on the planet along with a generous number of his nearly equal peers proved effective. <em>It’s not fair,</em> some people will say in the coming months about the fact that the team broadly believed to be the best ultimately won it all.</p>

<p>The Blue Jays looked set to win their first World Series since 1993 when they entered the ninth inning with a 4-3 lead. But with one out, and Toronto’s Jeff Hoffman facing the Dodgers’ No 9 hitter, Miguel Rojas, the reliever threw a hanging slider which Rojas launched for the tying home run. Will Smith then hit the winning home run in the 11th inning off Shane Bieber, the first time the Dodgers had led all night.</p>

      <p>Rural US towns reel as policies like tariffs cause global manufacturing companies to reconsider major investment projects</p>
<p>For decades, a line of storefronts in Jeffersonville, Ohio, a town of 1,200 people 40 minutes south-west of Columbus, lay empty.</p>
<p>But now locals are hard at work <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2025/04/14/jeffersonville-to-see-renaissance-">renovating the downtown</a> and paving streets in anticipation of a potential economic boom fueled by a huge new electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant.</p>

<p>Brad Marchand put the puck in the back of the net for the Florida Panthers on Saturday night, then pointed a finger in the air and looked to the sky. The reason was obvious. This goal was for Selah, the 10-year-old daughter of a close friend who died of cancer on Oct. 24.</p>

      <h1>The president who cried tariffs: will the US supreme court challenge Trump’s trade war?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>The US high court will hear arguments on whether Trump’s erratic imposition of global tariffs is legally valid</p>
<p>Donald Trump thrives on emergencies. He cried havoc on the very first day of his second term, declaring a national emergency caused by an “invasion” of “ <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/">illegal aliens</a>” from Mexico. He has since invoked emergencies more than any president since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, he faces another of his own making, as the US supreme court hears oral arguments on whether his globe-shaking signature economic policy – tariffs – is legally valid.</p>

      <h1>America’s redistricting fight: how could the US congressional map shift?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>Republicans hold a 219-213 majority in the House, but they could lock in more seats if reapportionments go their way</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats have entered a war in legislatures and courts to narrow the political battlefield of 2026 before a single vote is cast.</p>
<p>Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.</p>

<p>It was a feast fit for a king – and any billionaire willing to be his subject. From gold-rimmed plates on gold-patterned tablecloths decorated with gold candlestick holders, they gorged on heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice-cream.</p>
<p>On 15 October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom-9c5f582e5c0fbde2bee67f86b22898c5">for a dinner at the White House</a> to reward them for their pledged contributions to a vast new ballroom now expected to cost $300m.

<p>A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.</p>
<p>George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.</p>
<p>Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.</p>
<p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.</p>
<p>Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.</p>
<p>Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.</p>
<p>Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.</p>
<p>Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won their second consecutive title in stunning fashion in the early hours of Sunday morning, depriving the Toronto Blue Jays of a first World Series in 32 years in a stomach-churning, epic Game 7. Will Smith’s solo home run with two outs at the top of the 11th inning off Shane Bieber gave LA a 5-4 lead before Yoshinobu Yamamoto, pitching in relief just a day after throwing 96 pitches, got Alejandro Kirk to ground out into a World Series-ending double play, bringing a ninth title to the Dodgers organization.</p>
<p>“Man, they’re a special group of guys,” Smith said after the game. “We just never gave up, kept fighting, pitching our asses off, hitting, taking great at-bats. Finally punched through there. Man, that was a fight for seven games. That’s a really good <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> team. I’m just excited. There’s nothing better than this.”</p>

If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!”</p>

<p>Death penalty opponents have decried an unprecedented surge in executions ordered by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, after the state maintained a record pace with last week’s killing of a military veteran.</p>

<p>New Yorkers will find out the identity of their next mayor on Tuesday, in a race that will decide who will run, and defend, the US’s largest city at a time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has threatened to send military troops there.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, New York has seen a mayoral election that has pitted two very different Democrats against one another. The race has become an increasingly bitter face-off, laced with alleged racism and Islamophobia, but it is the political differences between the two main candidates that could have major implications for how the Democratic party performs in next year’s midterm elections.</p>

<p>The New York City Marathon, like the city it takes over each fall, is as vast as it is vibrant; as loud as it is chaotic; and more than a little daunting, too.</p>
<p>No marathon is easy. But an air of unpredictability lingers over the five boroughs, with hopefuls humbled, and favorites frustrated, as they embark on a challenging 26.2-mile tour of the city.</p>

<p>As of Nov. 1, all medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts headed to the U.S. will get a 25 per cent tariff, while buses will be levied at 10 per cent. While truck and bus making are small industries in Canada, experts say the tariffs could have a big impact.</p>

<p>A Canadian’s plan to bring his late celebrity wife back to life in AI form has raised a host of ethical questions about prolonging human existence in the digital universe. Alan Hamel, a Canadian entertainer and longtime TV personality, recently said he’s created an “AI twin” of Hollywood star Suzanne Somers, his wife and partner of 55 years who passed away in 2023.</p>

<p>Egg freezing is seen by some as a way for women to take control of their fertility. Other experts, though, fear that the fertility industry is just profiting off the tension women feel between career and family building.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stayed alive on Friday night, getting to Toronto Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman for three runs in the third inning to win 3-1 and even the World Series at three games apiece. Baseball fans around the world will be treated to a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday, with the Dodgers looking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since 2000. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, will try to play spoiler and complete the upset to win their first World Series since 1993.</p>
<p>After the Dodgers offense struggled in the first four games of the series, slashing just <a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/news/dodgers-offense-questions-world-series-game-6">.201/.296/.354</a> as a team, manager Dave Roberts shuffled his lineup ahead of Game 5. But it failed, as the Dodgers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/blue-jays-yesavage-dodgers-game-5-report-world-series">managed just four hits</a> and one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.</p>
