a $7 billion conditional loan for the joint venture between Stellantis
and Samsung SDI – called StarPlus Energy – to help the companies build
two EV battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana. The Department of Energy
estimates the projects will create 3,200 construction jobs and 2,800
operations jobs, and the finished plants will produce 67 GWh of
batteries, “enough to supply approximately 670,000 vehicles annually.”
The loan isn’t finalized yet, and its fate hangs in the balance as

the DOE announced another conditional loan for EVs: $6.6 billion for
Rivian to build its Georgia manufacturing plant.

using such a transaction to build climate resilience, and others are
likely to follow Barbados’ lead. “In the face of the climate crisis,
this groundbreaking transaction serves as a model for vulnerable states,

finds airlines aren’t using enough of the stuff to make any meaningful
difference. The report, from Brussels-based advocacy group Transport and
Environment, ranks 77 major global airlines and airline groups on their
use of and commitment to SAF using a points scale of 0 to 100 and found
that none of them scored above 61 points, “highlighting how much
progress airlines still need to make.” Most airlines failed to get above
24 points. SAF makes up about 1% of global aviation fuel use,

It is more expensive than fossil fuel-based kerosene and there isn’t

id="china-bans-exports-to-us-of-gallium-germanium-antimony-in-response-to-chip-sanctions">China
bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip
sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Bangkok — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United
States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials
with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing
back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.  </p>
<p>The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after Washington
expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on
computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory
chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.  </p>
<p>The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect
Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports
from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering
tensions over trade and technology.  </p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.  </p>
<p>“China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the
semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese
companies, and malicious suppression of China’s technological progress,”
Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine
briefing Tuesday.  </p>
<p>“I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S.
overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control
measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction
against Chinese companies,” Lin said.  </p>
<p>Minerals sourced in China used in computer chips, cars</p>
<p>China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for
licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such
as gallium and germanium.  </p>
<p>In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict
exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from
batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of
graphite.  </p>
<p>Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is
a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants,
batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according
to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.  </p>
<p>The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of
super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials
that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many
industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective
coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also
covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items
related to such super-hard materials.  </p>
<p>China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which
are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for
mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and
military technology.  </p>
<p>China says it’s protecting itself from US trade restrictions  </p>
<p>After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a
so-called “entity list” subject to strict export controls, China’s
Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China’s
“rights and interests.” Nearly all of the companies affected by
Washington’s latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some
are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.  </p>
<p>Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for
national security.  </p>
<p>China’s government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to
advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but
had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China’s
fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other
technology.  </p>
<p>Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting
the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.  </p>
<p>The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed
using national security as a grounds for export controls, “abuse of
export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of
China.”</p>
<p> “Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and
the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic
and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain,
and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,” it said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar
statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains
and inflating costs for American companies.</p>
<p> “U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China’s related
industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,” it said.
 </p>
<p>The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium
metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and
produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The
U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though
some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.</p>
<p>The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those
critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this
year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite
also have mostly risen.</p>

id="trump-says-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel">Trump
says will ‘block’ Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he
would “block” a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon
Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts.</p>
<p>“I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being
bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,” Trump
wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>“Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S.
Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I
will block this deal from happening.”</p>
<p>Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure
sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it
says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel said after Trump’s comments that it was “determined to
protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry,
domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.”</p>
<p>“We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized
facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and
secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can
manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,”
the Japanese firm said in a statement.</p>
<p>Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected
to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while
U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office.</p>
<p>Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was “vital” for US Steel
“to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and
operated.”</p>
<p>The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.</p>
<p>In September, Biden’s administration extended their review, pushing a
conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5
presidential election.</p>
<p>A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that
“the transaction is expected to close in… calendar year 2024” pending a
U.S. national security review.</p>
<p>“Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion
will come by the end of the year,” during Biden’s time in office, vice
chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters.</p>
<p>Trump will be inaugurated on January 20.</p>
<p>Protectionist policies</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic
policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a
trade war with the world’s second largest economy, China.</p>
<p>While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block
Nippon’s takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political
battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Trump’s vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional
opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been
criticized by both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>Analysts had suggested Trump’s position could soften after the
election was over, but Monday’s statement indicated that was not the
case.</p>
<p>Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to
succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed
acquisition.</p>
<p>The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a
September arbitrators’ ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US
Steel’s labor contract obligations.</p>
<p>In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of
the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.</p>

House: Biden expected to issue more pardons before end of term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the pardon of his son
Hunter, the White House said the president is expected to issue more
pardons and clemencies before he leaves office next month.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday
that Biden is “thinking through that process very thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a timeline for you,” Jean-Pierre said.  “As you know,
this usually happens towards the end.  And so, the president is going
through that process, thinking through that process. I’m not going to
get ahead of him. But you can expect more announcements to come.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax
offenses and could have been imprisoned for years.</p>
<p>Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a
lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life
spiraled out of control. </p>
<p>But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s
prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at
undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race
in July for another four-year term. </p>
<p>“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my
political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose
my election,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun
purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not
be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  </p>
<p>He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he
was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  </p>
<p>He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a
scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although
sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he
would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the
gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be
handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing
scheduled in Delaware for December 13. </p>
<p>The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as
well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken
part” from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024.   </p>
<p>Hunter Biden said in a statement, “I have admitted and taken
responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction –
mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and
my family for political sport.” </p>
<p>The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will
understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.”
  </p>
<p>“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell
the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth:
I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I
also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a
miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend,
there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an
abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump
supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array
of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6,
2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had
defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he
takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential
election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but
many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet
to occur. </p>
<p>Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned
Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was
convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he
intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to
France. </p>
<p>Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers,
Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief
strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among
others.  </p>
<p>Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S.
political landscape and not always predictably along political party
lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are
announced. </p>
<p>Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he
understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he
said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country.
This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and
will sadly tarnish his reputation.” </p>
<p>Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect
President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a
politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was
convicted by a jury of his peers.” </p>
<p>Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he
was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many
times he wouldn’t &amp; I believed him. Shame on me.”  </p>
<p>But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under
former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only
prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney
“would have charged this case given the underlying facts.” </p>

names billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to
Britain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire
investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious
posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included
$2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC.</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced
he was selecting Stephens to be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of
Saint James. The Senate is required to confirm the choice.</p>
<p>“Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I
am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat,
representing the U.S.A. to one of America’s most cherished and beloved
Allies,” Trump said in in his post.</p>
<p>Stephens is the chairman, president and CEO of Little Rock,
Arkansas-based financial services firm Stephens Inc., having taken over
the firm from his father.</p>
<p>Trump has already named many of his nominees for his Cabinet and
high-profile diplomatic posts, assembling a roster of staunch loyalists.
Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate real estate
developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner,
to serve as ambassador to France.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump selected Robert “Woody” Johnson, a
contributor to his campaign and the owner of the New York Jets football
team, as his representative to the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="trump-to-attend-notre-dame-cathedral-reopening-in-paris">Trump
to attend Notre Dame Cathedral reopening in Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump will attend the reopening
celebration for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this weekend, his first
foreign trip since the election.</p>
<p>The cathedral is set to reopen Saturday after more than five years of
reconstruction following a devastating fire in 2019. The invite-only
ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will be high-security affairs, with about
50 heads of state and government expected to attend.</p>
<p>Trump announced his trip in a post on his Truth Social site Monday
evening.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris,
France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and
Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a
devastating fire five years ago,” he wrote. “President Emmanuel Macron
has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to
its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day
for all!”</p>
<p>Trump and Macron have had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Macron was the guest of honor at Trump’s first state dinner and Trump
traveled to France several times. But the relationship soured as Trump’s
term progressed and Macron criticized him for questioning the need for
NATO and raising doubts about America’s commitment to the mutual-defense
pact.</p>
<p>As he ran for a second term this year, Trump often mocked Macron on
the campaign trail, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep
tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France
tried to tax American companies.</p>
<p>After Trump won another term last month, Macron rushed to win favor
with the president-elect. He was among the first global leaders to
congratulate Trump — even before The Associated Press called the race in
his favor — and beat UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the punch in
delivering a congratulatory phone call.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>,” Macron posted on
X early on Nov 6. “Ready to work together as we did for four years. With
your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and
prosperity.”</p>
<p>The reopening of Notre Dame will be an elaborate, multiday
celebration, beginning Saturday.</p>
<p>Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service
that afternoon, banging on Notre Dame’s shuttered doors with his staff
to reopen them, according to the cathedral’s website.</p>
<p>The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame’s
thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral’s lead
roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes have
been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned and returned.</p>
<p>Macron will attend and address the VIP guests.</p>
<p>After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and
Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; Paris-born cellist
Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji
and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening, according to the
show’s broadcaster, France Télévisions.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the Paris archbishop will lead an inaugural Mass
and consecration of the new altar.</p>
<p>Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the
celebration, along with priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris
diocese. The Mass will be followed by a “fraternal buffet” for the
needy.</p>
<p>Ile de la Cité, where the cathedral sits in the middle of the River
Seine, will be blocked off to tourists for the events. A public viewing
area with room for 40,000 spectators will be set up along the Seine’s
southern bank.</p>

id="congress-returns-facing-spending-disaster-relief-issues-ahead-of-change-in-administrations">Congress
returns, facing spending, disaster relief issues ahead of change in
administrations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Democratic-led U.S. Senate returned on Monday for a
showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over
government spending, disaster relief and defense policy before
President-elect Donald Trump ushers in a new era of single-party rule
next month.</p>
<p>The main challenge for lawmakers over the next three weeks is to
avert a pre-Christmas partial government shutdown by striking a
bipartisan deal to fund federal agencies beyond Dec. 20, when a current
stopgap spending measure is due to expire.</p>
<p>The debate will include a nearly $100 billion emergency disaster
relief request from President Joe Biden for areas of the U.S. Southeast
hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other communities struck by
natural disasters.</p>
<p>Congress also faces a Jan. 1 deadline for raising the federal
government’s debt ceiling, though lawmakers and aides say that
extraordinary measures employed by the Treasury Department are likely to
postpone the expected “X” date for default well into 2025.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated on Monday that
lawmakers are negotiating a short-term stopgap funding bill known as a
continuing resolution, or CR, rather than a package of annual spending
bills that would fund the government through fiscal year 2025, which
ends on Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Schumer did not disclose details about a potential CR, which House
Speaker Mike Johnson has said would run into early next year.</p>
<p>Trump’s allies are pushing for a three-month stopgap that supporters
say would allow their party’s incoming political trifecta to dismantle
current Democratic spending initiatives and policy priorities early in
the new administration.</p>
<p>Legislative action on government funding is not expected to begin in
the House until the last of the session’s three weeks, timing that could
raise risks for Johnson’s slim 220-213 Republican majority if they opt
for a partisan measure first.</p>
<p>House Republicans failed to pass their own partisan stop-gap measure
in September and had to rely on mainly Democratic votes to narrowly
avert a shutdown weeks before the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Top lawmakers have yet to say how they intend to handle a Biden
request for emergency disaster relief.</p>
<p>The head of the Small Business Administration recently testified to
Congress that the agency’s disaster loan program for homeowners,
renters, and businesses ran out of money in October, leaving more than
60,000 loan applicants waiting for assistance.</p>
<p>Congressional aides said a disaster relief package would likely be
attached to a CR.</p>
<p>But the first objective for Congress this month is likely to be
passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, annual
legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, according to
congressional aides. Floor votes could come as early as next week,
according to aides.</p>

id="biden-seeking-additional-24b-to-support-ukraine-replenish-us-weapons-stockpiles">Biden
seeking additional $24B to support Ukraine, replenish US weapons
stockpiles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional
$24 billion to support Ukraine and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles,
two U.S. officials tell VOA, as the administration continued Monday to
push out new aid packages from the last congressionally approved funds
for Kyiv before Biden leaves office on January 20.</p>
<p>Officials who have seen the administration’s request, on condition of
anonymity to discuss its details, told VOA, that the new support would
include $16 billion to restock U.S. weapons under the Pentagon’s
presidential drawdown authority (PDA), along with $8 billion to
manufacture weapons under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
which focuses on supplying Kyiv’s long-term defense needs.</p>
<p>“This funding not only supports Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty
and degrades Russian military capabilities but also strengthens U.S.
military readiness by modernizing our weapons systems and making direct
investments in our defense industrial base,” a U.S. defense official
told VOA on Monday.</p>
<p>The Biden administration submitted aid for Ukraine in an anomaly
funding bill that also includes spending on other matters rather than in
a separate supplemental funding request.</p>
<p>“We defer to Congress to determine the most appropriate vehicle for
addressing this urgent need,” one official said.</p>
<p>News of the latest request was first reported by Politico.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are already opposing the request.</p>
<p>“Any Biden funding demands should be DOA (dead on arrival),” Senator
Mike Lee posted on X.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who will determine whether the
bill is brought to a vote in the form proposed by the White House, wrote
on X that funding decisions “are for the incoming administration, not
the outgoing lame duck President.”</p>
<p>“The American people resoundingly elected President [Donald] Trump
because he promised to bring an end to wars, not prolong them
indefinitely,” Johnson added.</p>
<p>The aid request follows vows from Biden administration officials to
seek additional aid approval from Congress for 2025. Last week, the
Biden administration also informed Congress of its intention to forgive
$4.65 billion worth of Ukrainian debt.</p>
<p>The U.S. announced Monday it was sending another military aid package
to Ukraine valued at up to $725 million, its 71st tranche of equipment
from Department of Defense inventories for Kyiv since August 2021.
Monday’s PDA included air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket
systems and artillery, and anti-tank weapons.</p>
<p>The package is the latest round of aid stemming from a $61 billion
assistance bill for Kyiv that was approved by Congress in April after
several months of delays. The Biden administration still has more than
$8 billion in funding from previous aid packages to give to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Ukrainian Minister of
Defense Rustem Umerov on Monday to discuss battlefield dynamics and U.S.
security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>During his call with Umerov, Austin condemned Russia’s recent barrage
of missiles and drones targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure,
along with its use of an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile in
Ukraine, which the Pentagon called “another escalation in Russia’s war
against Ukraine.”</p>

id="transgender-attorney-to-argue-before-supreme-court-challenging-health-care-ban-for-minors">Transgender
attorney to argue before Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for
minors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court this week wades into the
contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an
attorney with knowledge that runs deep.</p>
<p>Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue
before the nation’s highest court, representing families who say
Tennessee’s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their
children terrified about the future.</p>
<p>Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender
rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald
Trumpput his fierce opposition front and center.</p>
<p>Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case
as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.</p>
<p>“I am able to do my job because I have had this health care that
transformed and, frankly, saved my life,” he said. “I am a testament to
the fact that we live among everyone.”</p>
<p>Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was
in law school. Now 42, he’s an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence
analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving
in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at
the Supreme Court. He’s also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a
father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his
Army-veteran brother.</p>
<p>He’s also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned
gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part
of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom
usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was
elected to Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson declared
support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.</p>
<p>Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that
treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young
people and that its law protects them from making treatment decisions
prematurely.</p>
<p>“Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do
not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the
lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point
that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,” state
attorneys wrote in court filings.</p>
<p>Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served
in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the
transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The
state attorney general’s office did not make Rice available for an
interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple
of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before
he earned his law degree from the University of California,
Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee’s
law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after
Trump takes office in January. </p>
<p>Strangio said he’ll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender
youth to access health care that wasn’t available when he was young.</p>
<p>“Many of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost
years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,” he said.
Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the
American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such
care, saying it’s safe when administered properly. </p>
<p>Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young
people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk
and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.</p>
<p>“There is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to
be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves
all agree they need,” he said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose
tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian
officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be
compared.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were
made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau.</p>
<p>“Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,”
President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S.,
Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that “the message
that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was
really understood.”</p>
<p>Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption
and “could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.”</p>
<p>Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and
Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.</p>
<p>Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries’ border
are vastly different.</p>
<p>U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian
border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the
Mexican border. Mexico’s efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the
U.S. have been lackluster.</p>
<p>Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000
overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using
precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.</p>
<p>On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the
Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at
the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the
same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million
encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because
Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the
past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to
leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018,
and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually
the case.</p>
<p>Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S.
president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some
assurances before Trump takes office.</p>
<p>Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border
security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law
enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the
U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back
to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar
agreement.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last
week with Trump, saying he “had agreed” that Mexico wanted to focus on
intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting “he said that in his
opinion that was good.”</p>
<p>But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in
Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law
enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor.</p>
<p>“That is going to maintained,” she said.</p>

id="delaware-judge-rejects-request-to-restore-musks-56-billion-tesla-pay">Delaware
judge rejects request to restore Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, Delaware — A Delaware judge ruled Monday that Tesla CEO
Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation
package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to
reinstate it.</p>
<p>The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court
of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package
excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty
over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker.</p>
<p>Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for
comment.</p>
<p>Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a
subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for
Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its
advances — and reinstate his compensation.</p>
<p>McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to
restore Musk’s pay package.</p>
<p>“Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties
to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits
would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion.</p>
<p>She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy
statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a
“cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay.</p>
<p>“Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a
powerful punch,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Tesla shares fell 1.4% in afterhours trade, following the ruling.</p>
<p>McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the
case $345 million, well short of the $6 billion they initially
requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock.</p>
<p>“We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined
Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court
proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp;
Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s
opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed.</p>
<p>Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as
McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week.
The appeal could take a year to play out.</p>
<p>After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with
thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the
possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like
artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla.</p>
<p>Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to
challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does
not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn
the ruling from a trial.</p>
<p>McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018
board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk
deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market
value, revenue and profitability.</p>
<p>But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying
the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had
conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to
him.</p>
<p>After the January ruling, Musk criticized the judge on his social
media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of
Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear
if any companies did so.</p>
<p>The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest
compensation plan ever — an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger
than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s
2012 pay plan.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to
Equilar, a compensation consulting firm.</p>
<p>Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of
Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of
escalating operational and financial goals.</p>
<p>Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that
shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when
they voted on the package.</p>

to block sale of cutting-edge, chip-making equipment to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration announced Monday that it has imposed a new
set of export controls on China, restricting the sale of cutting-edge,
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and high-bandwidth computer memory
to the communist nation.</p>
<p>The new rules ban the sale of 24 different kinds of equipment and
three different software tools, all of which are used to produce what
are known as “advanced node” semiconductors, the fastest and most
efficient chips on the market.</p>
<p>The export controls, announced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of
Industry and Security, also restrict the transfer of high-bandwidth
memory products, which advanced node semiconductors need to maximize
their performance in high-intensity applications, such as artificial
intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government added 140 companies, mostly in
China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry, to a list of
entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing
business with. In general, exporting certain technologies to companies
on the list requires a license from the federal government.</p>
<p>Blocking military development</p>
<p>The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing
China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of
concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and
advanced tools of social control.</p>
<p>“Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the
battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical,
biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and
voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political
dissidents,” the department said in a release announcing the
sanctions.</p>
<p>“This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s
targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair
[China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies
that pose a risk to our national security,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Gina Raimondo said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our
technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our
national security,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the
same statement. “As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new
ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and
partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading
technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national
security.”</p>
<p>China responds</p>
<p>In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington
condemned the sanctions.</p>
<p>“China strongly opposes the U.S.’ latest control measures on
semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and
non-market practice,” the embassy said.</p>
<p>The embassy accused the United States of “overstretching” the idea of
national security, abusing export control rules and “bullying.”</p>
<p>“The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,” the statement
said. “The US’ abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal
economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules
and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious
threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The
global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely
affected.”</p>
<p>The statement concluded with the promise that, “China will take
necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and
interests.”</p>
<p>Significant impact</p>
<p>Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the
Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new
sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a
world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing
semiconductors is “perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity
undertakes,” and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them
requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can
meaningfully restrict.</p>
<p>“Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and
components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the
world,” Ezell wrote. “If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to
these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply
chain that much more difficult and expensive.”</p>
<p>Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S.
manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that
China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips
anyway, which would produce the same result.</p>
<p>“The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and
like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries
in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be
recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production
in like-minded nations,” Ezell said.</p>
<p>He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major
semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute
similar policies toward China.</p>
<p>Advanced chips</p>
<p>The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called
“advanced node” chips and the equipment used to manufacture them.
Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the
transistors used in their manufacture.</p>
<p>Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three
one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual
transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip,
making them better at processing information, and more energy
efficient.</p>
<p>For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need
to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide
high-speed access to vast amounts of data.</p>

<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is widely expected to withdraw from
the Paris Agreement treaty on climate change after he takes office
January 20. China also is a party to the agreement. However, Beijing has
long argued that it is not wealthy enough to be forced to provide
similar financial assistance that Washington donates to the effort. VOA

id="california-lawmakers-to-begin-special-session-to-protect-state-laws-from-2nd-trump-presidency">California
lawmakers to begin special session to protect state laws from 2nd Trump
presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Governor Gavin Newsom and state
lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin a special
session to protect the state’s progressive policies ahead of another
Trump presidency.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald
Trump, is positioning California to once again be the center of a
resistance effort against the conservative agenda. He is asking his
Democratic allies in the Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both
chambers, to approve additional funding to the attorney general’s office
to prepare for a robust legal fight against anticipated federal
challenges.</p>
<p>Democratic Assembly member Jesse Gabriel on Monday introduced
legislation to set aside $25 million for legal fees to respond to
potential attacks by the Trump administration on state policies
regarding civil rights, climate change, immigration and abortion
access.</p>
<p>“While we always hope to collaborate with our federal partners,
California will be ready to vigorously defend our interests and values
from any unlawful action by the incoming Trump Administration,” Gabriel
said in a statement.</p>
<p>California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times to
various levels of success. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to be caught flat-footed,” Newsom said at a recent
news conference.</p>
<p>Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in
America. Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and
have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation,
outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide.</p>
<p>Trump called the Democratic governor “New-scum” during a campaign
stop in Southern California and has relentlessly lambasted the
Democratic stronghold over its large number of immigrants in the U.S.
illegally, homeless population and thicket of regulations.</p>
<p>Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta
smelt, a tiny fish that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and
threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat
from wildfires. He also vowed to follow through with his campaign
promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal
status and prosecuting his political enemies.</p>
<p>Before the special session was set to begin, state lawmakers swore in
more than two dozen new members and elected leaders for the 2025
legislative session.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people also demonstrated around the Capitol on Monday to
urge the Legislature to try to stop Trump’s mass deportation plans. They
carried banners that said “Not one cent for mass deportation” and “MAGA
out of California.”</p>
<p>“With the results of the presidential election, we need our state
elected officials to use every tool and every resource they have
available to them to protect our immigrant Californians,” protester
Deborah Lee said.</p>
<p>State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office will protect the
state’s immigrant population, while Newsom last week unveiled a proposal
to revive a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases if the
incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people
who buy electric cars. Newsom is also considering creating a backup
disaster relief fund for the wildfire-prone state after Trump’s
threats.</p>
<p>Bonta announced legislation Monday aimed at bolstering reproductive
rights in the state, including by allowing the attorney general to seek
monetary penalties against local governments that infringe on those
rights. The proposals are part of the state’s efforts to safeguard
against threats to abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers blasted Newsom and his Democratic allies over
the special session. Representative Vince Fong, who represents the
state’s Central Valley farm belt, said California should work with the
incoming Trump administration instead.</p>
<p>“Gavin Newsom’s actions are tone-deaf to the concerns of Californians
who disapprove of the direction of our state and country,” Fong said in
a video on social media.</p>
<p>Legislators also are expected to spend the year discussing ways to
protect dozens of laws expected to be targeted by the Trump
administration, including one that has made the state a sanctuary for
people seeking abortions who live in states where such practices have
been severely limited. </p>
<p>California, the nation’s most populous state, was the first to
mandate that by 2035 all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in
California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids. The state
also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents
regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<p>Newsom hasn’t provided details about what actions the lawmakers will
consider but said he wanted funding in place before Trump’s inauguration
day, January 20. The state spent roughly $42 million in litigation costs
during the first Trump administration, officials said.</p>

id="cyber-monday-shoppers-expected-to-set-record-in-online-sales">Cyber
Monday shoppers expected to set record in online sales</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online
deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping
marathon with Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>Even though e-commerce is now part of many people’s regular routines
and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday — a term coined in 2005 by
the National Retail Federation — has become the biggest online shopping
day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has
created to fuel it.</p>
<p>Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to
spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That
would make it the season’s — and the year’s — biggest shopping day for
e-commerce.</p>
<p>Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and
10 p.m. Monday, per Adobe — reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent
every minute.</p>
<p>For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event
that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales
event right after midnight Pacific time Saturday. Target’s two days of
discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart
rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members Sunday afternoon
and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern
time.</p>
<p>Consumer spending for Cyber Week — the five major shopping days
between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — provides a strong indication of
how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.</p>
<p>Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following
the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods
and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales
nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a
healthy pace.</p>
<p>At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been
rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use “buy now, pay
later” plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on
holiday decor, gifts and other items.</p>
<p>Many economists have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump’s
plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United
States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing
to automobiles.</p>
<p>The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more
this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of
spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5%
to 3.5% — compared to 3.9% in 2023.</p>
<p>A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season
won’t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period.
But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging
signs for retailers.</p>
<p>Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that
discounts from Thanksgiving onward have “exceeded expectations” — and
online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40
billion mark combined.</p>
<p>U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2%
increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s also more
than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in
roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1
billion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online
shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion
in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse,
which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black
Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail
sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online
sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest
0.7%.</p>
<p>E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5
billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached
$4.6 million per minute — with top categories by volume including
clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian
company.</p>
<p>Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were
among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black
Friday, according to Adobe. “Hot products” included Lego sets, espresso
machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.</p>
<p>Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black
Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with
the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the
comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported
that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the
U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the
Midwest.</p>
<p>While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular
around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more
“experience-driven spending” in recent years, especially as the COVID-19
pandemic waned.</p>
<p>Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this
season — with consumers opening their wallets to invest or “trade up” to
more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and
sporting goods.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Confidence in the United Nations’ ability to find cooperative solutions
to some of humanity’s biggest threats
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop29-finance" target="_self"><u>took
another walloping</u></a> this weekend when negotiators left the fifth
and final UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Busan, South Korea, with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/world-court-climate-case#:~:text=Talks%20on%20a%20global%20plastics%20treaty%20fail" target="_self"><u>no
deal</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
A planet-wide agreement on curbing plastic pollution was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-world-is-inching-slowly-and-chaotically-towards-a-new-plastics-treaty" target="_self"><u>always
going to be a big ask</u></a>. Lacking the existential drama that
undergirds the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop29-finance" target="_self"><u>annual
climate change conference</u></a>, the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee for Plastics (or “the INC-5,” as this fifth round of meetings
was seductively named) doesn’t exactly attract the same level of media
attention as its parent group. For another thing, the connection of
plastics to the cascading effects of global warming is less obvious than
that of burning fossil fuels, though by no means less severe:
Conventional plastics are made using newly extracted fossil fuels and,
as such, are a last resort profit center for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>oil
companies</u></a> facing the expiration of their social license to
operate. Plastic-related emissions are expected to outpace those of coal
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/plastics-outpace-coals-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-report-2021-10-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>within
the decade</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet despite fierce resistance from petrochemical-producing
industries and nations (more on that later), a curious champion has
emerged for a legally binding plastic treaty. Alongside the expected
environmental heavyweights in Busan last week were several business
coalitions pushing in tandem for more ambitious mandatory regulations.
</p>
<p>
There are plans to hold an “INC-5.2” next year to resolve the
outstanding differences, and mounting pressure from business interests
on the <em><em>other</em></em> side of the fight could potentially
neutralize at least some of the influence of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/climate/saudi-arabia-global-plastic-treaty.html#:~:text=Saudi%20Aramco%2C%20the%20national%20oil%20company%2C%20lists%20%E2%80%9Cincreased%20concerns%20regarding%20the%20safe%20use%20of%20chemicals%20and%20plastics%20and%20their%20potential%20impact%20on%20the%20environment%E2%80%9D%20and%20the%20%E2%80%9Crestrictive%20regulations%E2%80%9D%20those%20concerns%20may%20spur%20as%20risks%20to%20its%20business." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
countries that normally dominate such talks</u></a>. “Businesses cannot
solve the crisis alone,” Julia Cohen, the co-founder and managing
director of Plastic Pollution Coalition, told me in an emailed
statement. But they can “play a key role in shaping national positions,
driving scalable solutions, and fostering emerging markets” alongside
continued efforts to secure a global treaty.
</p>
<p>
Two main business coalitions are attempting to do just that. The first
is Champions of Change, which works with the Plastic Pollution
Coalition, Greenpeace, and Break Free From Plastic, and counts among its
350 signatories household brands like Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Blueland, and
Lush Cosmetics. The alliance is
<a href="https://championsofchange.breakfreefromplastic.org/open-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demanding</u></a>
a cap on plastic pollution, the phase-out of single-use plastics,
greater reuse targets, and a justice-focused approach that centers the
concerns of frontline communities. “Voluntary corporate pledges are no
match for an international legally binding treaty that would require
companies to move away from plastic,” Sybil Bullock, the senior oceans
campaigner at Greenpeace, told me in an email. “We have seen past
voluntary business commitments from top polluters fail time and time
again to deliver meaningful reductions in plastic pollution.”
</p>
<p>
The Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, by contrast,
<a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/latest/business-coalition-open-letter-ahead-of-inc-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stops
short</u></a> of calling for a plastic cap,
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15112024/nations-struggle-to-agree-on-global-plastics-treaty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>focusing
instead</u></a> on phasing out “avoidable plastic products” and calling
for a “global criteria for circular product design.” Specifically, the
group — convened by the World Wildlife Fund and the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation, which advocates for a circular economy — is pushing for a
“treaty based on strong global rules across the full lifecycle of
plastics and with a comprehensive financing mechanism.” Its signatories
include<em> </em>businesses that have historically been criticized for
their reliance on plastic,
<a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/endorsers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a>
Unilever, Nestle, and PepsiCo, and its softer approach has its skeptics.
</p>
<p>
“You can only downcycle plastic and currently, how plastic is recycled,
it gets contaminated by other plastics that are so toxic we cannot use
them for anything that is touching or even close to touching our food,”
KT Morelli, a campaign organizer for Breathe Free Detroit, which
successfully campaigned to shut down a local plastic incinerator, told
me. “There’s no circular answer to plastics.”
</p>
<p>
Kristen McDonald, the senior director of the plastics program at Pacific
Environment, an environmental group focused on the Pacific Rim, agreed
that “business actions alone — voluntary steps — have not worked so far,
and so I’m very skeptical that they will work in the future.” Still, she
said it’s only logical that businesses are as impatient as
environmentalists when deciding on plastic regulations. If an
international agreement isn’t reached, it creates a “really chaotic
business environment where certain plastics are restricted in some
places and not in others,” leading to trade problems and an uneven
playing field at a global level as different companies face different
local rules. As she added, a plastic treaty “actually
<em><em>stabilizes</em></em> things for companies” — unless, of course,
the company in question happens to be in the petrochemical industry.
</p>
<p>
Even the environmentalists working with the business groups agree that
there isn’t an entirely private-sector solution to the plastic crisis.
“We’re not ready to give up on the treaty process,” Erin Simon, the vice
president and head of plastic waste and business at WWF, told me over
email. But, she pointed out, after the U.S. pulled out of the Paris
Agreement in 2017, there had been a “groundswell of support from cities,
states, and other non-federal actors,” including corporations that
filled in the leadership void with “commitments that would help move the
needle toward reaching our global climate goals.”
</p>
<p>
And yet despite the limitations of the business coalitions, Morelli told
me she thinks there is still promise in the private sector. “They have
more power than the government,” she stressed, noting that “small
companies and large companies can choose to refuse plastic” and push
their suppliers to do the same.
</p>
<p>
This is significant because, as is the case at COP, oil-rich nations
(and
<a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/11/27/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-flood-final-scheduled-round-of-global-plastics-treaty-negotiations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oil-rich
lobbyists</u></a>) hold outsized negotiating power at the meetings.
Despite more than 100 nations favoring an agreement that would have
curbed plastic <em><em>production </em></em>— turning off the tap at the
source, as plastic-reduction advocates like to say — Russia, Saudi
Arabia, and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/01/plastic-pollution-treaty-global-un-busan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pushed
for a treaty</u></a> last week that would have focused on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>plastic
recycling</u></a> and
“<a href="https://american-chemistry.read.axioshq.com/p/acc-news-release/f2029ecb-155c-442a-b3b4-1a27b391b42f?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_location=email_view_in_browser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mismanaged
waste</u></a>,” instead, an insistence that led negotiations straight
into an impasse.
(<a href="https://grist.org/regulation/us-backtracks-production-caps-global-plastics-treaty-united-nations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>After
flip-flopping</u></a>, the United States took a noncommittal middle
ground of opposing mandatory production caps but otherwise agreeing that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/world-unable-cope-10-years-talks-un-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-waste" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
much plastic is probably bad</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
In the absence of a treaty and with pessimism growing around INC-5.2,
business-led action might be the best shot remaining for plastic-free
organizers. “Having these companies step up on their own is huge and
would help us all,” Morelli said.

unveils fresh export curbs targeting China’s chip sector</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States announced new export restrictions
Monday taking aim at China’s ability to make advanced semiconductors —
used in weapon systems and artificial intelligence  as competition
intensifies between the world’s two biggest economies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our
technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our
national security,” said White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan in a statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners
to “to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading
technologies and know-how.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies,
including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production
equipment, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as
reassessing and updating our controls,” added Under Secretary of
Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest announcement also includes controls on two dozen types of
chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or
producing semiconductors.</p>

<p>
Maybe it broke, maybe it doesn’t fit, or maybe we realized we don’t need
a Godzilla-shaped humidifier — whatever the reason, returns are
expensive for stores, and they’re cracking down. Some 81% of retailers
started charging customers for at least one of their return options last
year. We’ll hear more. Plus, the dollar swings after Trump threatens
tariffs, and a shipbuilder in Northern Ireland files for bankruptcy.

id="analysts-say-bidens-first-trip-to-africa-shouldve-come-earlier-in-presidency">Analysts
say Biden’s first trip to Africa should’ve come earlier in
presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S.
Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first
presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a
quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come
sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given
its troubling human rights record.</p>
<p>White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to
visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some
analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps
down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier.  </p>
<p>Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke
to VOA from South Africa. </p>
<p>“I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise
just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and,
of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels
like an afterthought to his presidency,” said Nel. </p>
<p>After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s
northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola.  </p>
<p>There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade,
investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s
President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on
trade, security, and health. </p>
<p>More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature
initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway
project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan
port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.  </p>
<p>The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple
partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies
around the world, officials say.  </p>
<p>Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior
director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking
about the broader benefits associated with the project. </p>
<p>“What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it
isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the
communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access
to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and
it’s about increases in digital connectivity,” said Brown.</p>
<p>Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion,
making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan
Africa. </p>
<p>Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil
producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural
resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people,
resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment
and high cost of living.  </p>
<p>Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. </p>
<p>“Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs
to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so,
to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and
it has massive potential,” said Nel.  </p>
<p>But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties,
Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they
see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing
concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society
organizations and freedom of expression.  </p>
<p>In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly
criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And “if human rights
are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand
Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government
critics.”   </p>
<p>Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights
in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment.  </p>
<p>“I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting
President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I
commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask
those tough questions to President João Lourenço,” said Nuvunga. “We
have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained
unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails,
some of them in critical conditions,” said Nuvunga.  </p>
<p>Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.</p>

id="chief-of-icc-lashes-out-at-us-and-russia-over-threats-accusations">Chief
of ICC lashes out at US and Russia over threats, accusations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Hague, Netherlands — The president of the International Criminal
Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with
its investigations, calling attacks on the court “appalling.”</p>
<p>“The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by
another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a
terrorist organization,” Judge Tomoko Akane said in her address to the
institution’s annual meeting, which opened on Monday.</p>
<p>Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham,
whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in
January, and who called the court a “dangerous joke” and urged Congress
to sanction its prosecutor. “To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany,
France, if you try to help the ICC, we’re going to sanction you,” Graham
said on Fox News.</p>
<p>Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had
granted a request from the court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue
arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his
former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief for crimes against
humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza.</p>
<p>This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a
sitting leader of a major Western ally.</p>
<p>ICC faces challenges on arrest warrants</p>
<p>Graham’s threat isn’t seen as just empty words. President-elect
Donald Trump sanctioned the court’s previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda,
with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and
intelligence officials in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. “Several elected
officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member
of the Security Council,” she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and
others in response to the investigation into Putin.</p>
<p>The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC’s 124 member
countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members
and approve the court’s budget against a backdrop of unfavorable
headlines.</p>
<p>The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court of
last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous
atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime
of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable
or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124
countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the
institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China.</p>
<p>The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute
arrest warrants.</p>
<p>The decision to warrant issues for Netanyahu and Israel’s ex-Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant has been denounced by critics of the court and
given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark
contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian
President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the
former defense minister “outrageous” and vowed to stand with Israel. A
year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin “justified” and said the
Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC
member country.</p>
<p>France said it would “respect its obligations” but would need to
consider Netanyahu’s possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was
announced, France said it would “lend its support to the essential work”
of the court.</p>
<p>Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would
arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants “utterly incomprehensible.”
Italy called them “wrong” but said it would be obliged to arrest him.
Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it
would stand with Israel instead of the court.</p>
<p>Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could
undermine global justice efforts. “It really has the potential to damage
not just the court, but international law,” she told The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State
University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a
number of people who contribute to the court’s work, such as
international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the
current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and
others.</p>
<p>“Sanctions are a huge burden,” Sterio said.</p>
<p>Accusations against Khan</p>
<p>Also hanging heavy over the meeting in The Hague are the internal
pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old
British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide
into a sexual relationship and groped her.</p>
<p>Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged
misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it
interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she
opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He
has denied the claims.</p>
<p>The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an
external probe into the allegations. It’s not clear if the investigation
will be addressed during the meeting.</p>
<p>Khan took the floor after Akane. He didn’t address the accusations
against him or the threats against the court directly, other than to say
the institution was facing “unprecedented challenges.”</p>
<p>Instead he highlighted his office’s recent request for an arrest
warrant against the head of Myanmar’s military government and said he
planned to request warrants related to Afghanistan and Sudan in the
coming months.</p>
<p>Late last week, six countries including France, Luxembourg and Mexico
asked Khan’s office to look into possible crimes in Afghanistan since
the Taliban took control in 2021. While Khan isn’t obligated to open an
investigation in response to such a request, historically court
prosecutors have done so.</p>
<p>The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will
have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has
issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile
suspects remain at large.</p>
<p>Member states don’t always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when
he visited in September. Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir is
wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur,
but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested
a warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime, Senior Gen. Min
Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority.
Judges have yet to decide on that request.</p>
<p>“It becomes very difficult to justify the court’s existence,” Sterio
said.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-four-years-will-be-a-fight.-embrace-it.">The Next Four
Years Will Be a Fight. Embrace It.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDk5NDg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTE1OTUzNn0.xfL2Iq1IUoHqYm_oOBgAvWVvjjqQt4szCgdBuJ9O9lE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, millions of people
participated in hundreds of marches around the country and the world to
demonstrate their commitment in the new cause of resistance. No such
large-scale protests are materializing for next January 20; those who
hoped Trump would lose the presidential election now seem more
demoralized than defiant.
</p>
<p>
That reaction is understandable. After a period of progress and optimism
about the future, and even as the climate crisis grows more dire, we are
in for a difficult four years. As Jesse Jenkins
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a>
just after the election, the outcome “dealt a devastating blow to U.S.
efforts to cut climate-warming pollution.”
</p>
<p>
But for those feeling despair, there is a way forward: <em><em>Embrace
the fight</em></em>. Sometimes politics is about compromise, sometimes
it’s about patience, and sometimes it’s about righteous fury. This time,
fury may be just what’s called for.
</p>
<p>
There’s no doubt that some very bad vibrations will emanate from
Washington. Trump is arriving with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project
2025 blueprint</u></a> in hand, ready to undermine climate progress in
every corner of government. Key agencies will be led by a veritable
murderer’s row of fossil fuel enthusiasts, from the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy" target="_self"><u>fracking
executive</u></a> who will helm the Department of Energy to the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>all-of-the-above</u></a>”
enthusiast who will lead both the Department of the Interior and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self"><u>the
new National Energy Council</u></a>, the goal of which is to achieve
what Trump calls, in all caps, “ENERGY DOMINANCE.”
</p>
<p>
As far as Trump is concerned, “dominance” comes not from wimpy
renewables but from pounding holes in the ground and burning what comes
out of them, the manly pursuit of those whose hearts beat faster at the
thought of America’s foes kneeling in submission before our virile
power. And it comes from reversing whatever Joe Biden did, not because
Trump necessarily cares whether consumers get subsidies to buy heat
pumps, but because undoing his predecessor’s legacy shows that Trump is
a winner and everyone else is a loser.
</p>
<p>
As much as
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/after-voters-soundly-rejected-it-electing-trump-what-s-next-for-the-radical-climate-agenda/ar-AA1uOC9s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some</u></a>
would like us to believe that by giving Trump one of the
<a href="https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/busting-myths-about-the-2024-election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>narrowest</u></a>
presidential victories in history the voters were explicitly rejecting
the Biden administration’s climate policies in favor of Trump’s fossil
fuel agenda, there is no evidence that’s true. As much as we would have
liked it to be otherwise,
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most</u></a>
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polls</u></a>
showed climate change ranking low when people were asked what decided
their vote. Indeed, the most persuasive explanation for the election
outcome is that all over the world, voters have turned out whichever
party was in power when the wave of post-pandemic inflation hit; Kamala
Harris nearly overcame that anti-incumbent wave, but wasn’t able to in
the end.
</p>
<p>
So while Trump may not have much of a “mandate” in general, he certainly
doesn’t have one to reverse the progress the country has made on
climate. That means the politics of opposing the administration’s
climate efforts are in advocates’ favor. At the very least, there is
plenty of room to persuade the public that the Trump administration is
doing something awful on climate.
</p>
<p>
Embracing the fight will mean acknowledging that while bipartisanship is
sometimes an effective tool, it isn’t an end in itself. Republicans
should certainly be welcomed as allies whenever they want to join in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/conservative-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>defending
climate progress</u></a> or pushing back on efforts to undermine it, but
the days when Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich would
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6n_-wB154" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>film
an ad together</u></a> pledging their commitment to address climate
change are long behind us. It would be nice if there was a consensus on
the need to transition off of fossil fuels, but there isn’t. Instead,
there’s a climate assault on its way, and while appeals to the
self-interest of some Republicans (such as those politicians
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/old-school-politics-ira" target="_self"><u>whose
districts</u></a> are benefiting enormously from clean energy
investments) are possible, a battle is more likely.
</p>
<p>
That isn’t a bad thing. Conflicts are energizing — they clarify stakes,
focus media attention, and motivate people to get involved. And just as
many climate advocates realized that warnings of doom (even accurate
ones) are often less effective than an optimistic vision of a future of
abundance, we should also understand that one of the most powerful
arguments in politics is that someone is trying to take something away
from you. Which is exactly what Trump will likely do, and when it
happens, people ought to be mad about it.
</p>
<p>
This fight will take place both in Washington and between the Trump
administration on one side and
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/what-can-us-cities-and-states-do-for-the-climate-under-trump-plenty/ar-AA1uRBeQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>states
and cities</u></a> on the other. Ambitious Democrats including Governor
Gavin Newsom of California are looking for ways to resist the new Trump
administration, not only on substantive grounds but also because
standing up to Trump is good politics for them. When they do so on
climate policy (as Newsom did when he
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-newsom-ev-electric-vehicle-rebate-b55ab3d35145384c1bb192cbda536b0a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>
that his state offer tax credits for electric vehicles if Republicans
eliminate the ones provided for in the Inflation Reduction Act), it will
highlight climate actions Trump is taking that might otherwise have been
overlooked.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the climate story of the past few years has been an
encouraging one — the passage of the IRA (the most consequential climate
law ever), steadily dropping prices for renewables, innovations in
energy and carbon mitigation, and more. The next few years will be
characterized by conflict.
</p>
<p>
That may not be what climate advocates want, but it’s unavoidable. And
no outcome is predetermined. November 5 altered the politics of climate
change, but it didn’t end them; there will be plenty of opportunities to
create controversies, exploit political opportunities, and get voters
justifiably angry. Fighting — thoughtfully, with careful planning and
energy — will be more important than ever.

<li>World Court begins hearings on nations’ climate obligations
</h3>
<p>
The International Court of Justice – also known as the World Court –
today will start hearing from 99 countries and dozens of organizations
on what legal obligations rich countries should have in fighting climate
change and helping vulnerable nations recover and adapt. Crucially, the
judges will also ponder potential consequences for countries’ actions
(or lack thereof) that have caused climate harm. Major oil producers and
greenhouse gas emitters, as well as OPEC, will also speak at the
hearings. The case is the largest in the history of the top U.N. court.
An advisory opinion from the World Court would not be binding, but the
outcome “could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including
domestic lawsuits,” <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em>

Committee meeting in South Korea was the fifth such summit so far and
was to be the last, but because it ended without a deal, leaders decided
to kick the can down the road and return for more talks at an
undetermined later date. The tensions at this meeting weren’t that
different from those hampering the COP climate talks on fossil fuel use,
with major oil-producing nations blocking meaningful progress. In this
case, while more than 100 countries called for a binding treaty to
reduce plastic production, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others opposed this
idea and instead favored a voluntary treaty aimed at improving waste
management. The U.S signalled support for the idea of reducing plastic
pollution but

degradation already affects 15 million square kilometers (about 5.7

<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROSEMONT, Ill. — The Big Ten Conference announced it fined Michigan
and Ohio State $100,000 each for violating the conference’s
sportsmanship policy for the on-field melee at the end of the
Wolverines’ win in Columbus on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Not only did the actions of both teams violate fundamental elements
of sportsmanship such as respect and civility, the nature of the
incident also jeopardized the safety of participants and bystanders,”
the Big Ten said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>A fight broke out at midfield after the Wolverines’ 13-10 victory
when Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on the OSU logo and
were confronted by the Buckeyes.</p>
<p>Police used pepper spray to break up the players, who threw punches
and shoves. One officer suffered a head injury when he was “knocked down
and trampled while trying to separate players fighting,” a police union
official said. The officer was taken to a hospital and has since been
released.</p>
<p>After the Ohio State players confronted their rivals at midfield,
defensive end Jack Sawyer grabbed the top of the Wolverines’ flag and
ripped it off the pole as the brawl moved toward the Michigan bench.</p>
<p>“We respect the Big Ten Conference’s decision in this matter,” Ohio
State said in a statement. “What happened post-game yesterday was
unfortunate. Good sportsmanship is always important in everything we do
at Ohio State. Moving forward, we will continue to examine and address
our post-game protocols to ensure our student-athletes, coaches,
visiting teams and staff safely exit the field.”</p>
<p>Ohio State police said in a statement that “multiple officers
representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray.” Michigan players
could be seen rubbing their eyes after exposure to the chemical
irritant.</p>
<p>Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said after the game both teams could
have handled the situation differently.</p>
<p>“So much emotions on both sides,” he said. “Rivalry games get heated,
especially this one. It’s the biggest one in the country, so we got to
handle that better.”</p>
<p>A Michigan athletic department spokesman said Sunday night the
football program would have no comment beyond the team’s remarks
Saturday.</p>
<p>The scuffle was one of many that broke out Saturday in rivalry games
across the country.</p>

<h2 id="biden-pardons-son-hunter-for-gun-tax-offenses">Biden pardons son
Hunter for gun, tax offenses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter,
who was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could
have been imprisoned for years.   </p>
<p>Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a
lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life
spiraled out of control. </p>
<p>But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s
prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at
undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race
in July for another four-year term. </p>
<p>“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my
political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose
my election,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun
purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not
be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  </p>
<p>He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he
was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  </p>
<p>He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a
scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although
sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he
would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the
gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be
handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing
scheduled in Delaware for December 13. </p>
<p>The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as
well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken
part” from Jan. 1, 2014, to Jan. 1, 2024.   </p>
<p>Hunter Biden said in a statement, “I have admitted and taken
responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction –
mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and
my family for political sport.” </p>
<p>The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will
understand why a father and a president would come to this
decision.”   </p>
<p>“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell
the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth:
I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I
also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a
miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend,
there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an
abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump
supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array
of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6,
2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had
defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he
takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential
election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but
many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet
to occur. </p>
<p>Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned
Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was
convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he
intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to
France. </p>
<p>Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers,
Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief
strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among
others.  </p>
<p>Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S.
political landscape and not always predictably along political party
lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are
announced. </p>
<p>Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he
understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he
said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country.
This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and
will sadly tarnish his reputation.” </p>
<p>Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect
President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a
politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was
convicted by a jury of his peers.” </p>
<p>Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he
was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many
times he wouldn’t &amp; I believed him. Shame on me.”  </p>
<p>But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under
former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only
prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney
“would have charged this case given the underlying facts.” </p>

id="trump-appoints-lebanese-american-massad-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser">Trump
appoints Lebanese American Massad Boulos as Middle East adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he had appointed
American Lebanese businessman Massad Boulos, the father of one of his
sons-in-law, as his Middle East adviser.</p>
<p>“Massad is a skilled negotiator and a steadfast advocate for PEACE in
the Middle East. He will be a staunch defender of the United States and
its interests,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, as the conflict between
Israel and Hamas has been plaguing the region for more than a year.</p>
<p>A longtime Republican, Boulos built his fortune selling automobiles
in Nigeria. The 2022 marriage of his son Michael Boulos to Donald
Trump’s daughter Tiffany propelled him into the newly elected
billionaire’s inner circle.</p>
<p>Boulos took an active part in the presidential campaign, working to
convince the Arab community in some key states to vote for Trump.</p>
<p>“Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected business
leader with extensive experience on the international stage,” the
president-elect, who is due to take office on January 20, said.</p>
<p>A Maronite Christian, Boulos had tried to get elected as a
parliamentarian in Lebanon, without success.</p>
<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end
the conflict between Israel and Hamas, without ever revealing a plan to
do so.</p>
<p>Boulos had explained in October that he shared the same
philosophy.</p>
<p>Israel “has military objectives to achieve, namely to get rid of
Hamas’ infrastructure and its capacity to launch new attacks,” he said
in an interview with Sky News.</p>
<p>But “they have to do it very quickly. (…), It cannot last forever,”
he added.</p>
<p>His appointment comes days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel
and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Islamist movement allied with Hamas and
Iran.</p>
<p>This truce in Lebanon gives hope for progress in the Middle East to
the administration of Joe Biden, still in power for a few weeks.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Lebanon deal, the United States is “actively”
working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Jake
Sullivan, the current White House national security adviser, said
Sunday. But “we’re not there yet,” he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump also named Charles Kushner, the father of his
other son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, as U.S.
ambassador to France.</p>
<p>An unusual choice for a diplomatic role: Kushner spent a year in
federal prison for tax fraud before being pardoned by Trump toward the
end of his first term in the White House.</p>

president meets Hawaii’s governor, others in visit China condemns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Honululu, Hawaii — On a two-day visit to Hawaii, Taiwan’s president
Lai Ching-te met with the state’s governor and congressional
representatives as part of a Pacific island tour that has already
triggered criticism from Beijing.</p>
<p>On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemned” U.S.
support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also
denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a
self-governing island that China claims as its own territory.</p>
<p>“China will closely monitor the situation’s development and take
resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity,” said the statement.</p>
<p>Hawaii was Lai’s first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take
him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of
the 12 countries Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with.</p>
<p>Hawaii’s Gov. Josh Green on Saturday hosted Lai at the state’s
emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness.
Green, who was a longtime emergency room physician before becoming
governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their
experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a
physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from
Harvard University.</p>
<p>“Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation,
highlighting Hawai’i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration
with Taiwan,” Green said in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>Lai also visited Bishop Museum, Hawaii’s leading museum of natural
history and Native Hawaiian culture.</p>
<p>In the evening, Lai posed for photos with Hawaii congressional
representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the
Taiwanese American community.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress,
said on social media that he told the audience that “our ties endured on
shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared
challenges.”</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from
the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump
administration during his Hawaii stay.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in
July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased
billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from
Chinese military action.</p>
<p>The new arms deal announced by the U.S. State Department Friday
includes $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s,
as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the
Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity
over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by
China.</p>
<p>Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew vocal opposition from
China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin
America. Tsai met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the
time.</p>
<p>The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as
a “stern warning” over what it called collusion between “separatists and
foreign forces” days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped
over in the U.S.</p>
<p>China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting
the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and
Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan.
Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1979.</p>

id="biden-has-aids-memorial-quilt-at-white-house-observing-world-aids-day">Biden
has AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House, observing World AIDS Day</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday had the AIDS Memorial
Quilt spread on the White House South Lawn for the first time in
observance of World AIDS Day.</p>
<p>Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors,
family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the
epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government’s support for
the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS.</p>
<p>“This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of
America,” Biden said. “For all the lives lost, for all those that are
still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and
minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That’s the
power of this movement.”</p>
<p>There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate
people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the
quilt made its first public appearance in 1987. There was also a red
ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS,
draped across the South Portico of the White House.</p>
<p>There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to
the White House.</p>
<p>Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White,
contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and
died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son’s experience taught
America that “we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have
it.”</p>
<p>The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990, and White-Grinder
recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met
Biden when he was a senator from Delaware.</p>
<p>The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious
disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, Fauci was in
attendance at the event as he worked to treat AIDS, though he’s known by
much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic
that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the
epidemic, and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other
steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure
prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV
infections.</p>

<h2 id="trump-nominates-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser">Trump nominates
Boulos as Middle East adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday his nomination of
Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos to serve as a senior adviser
on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany.  He was a
member of Trump’s election campaign, working on the outreach to Arab
American communities in the key state of Michigan amid dissatisfaction
with the Biden administration’s response to Israel’s offensives against
militants in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Trump won the state in last month’s election after losing there to
President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>“Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the
Middle East,” Trump said on his Truth Social site.  “He will be a strong
advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to
have him on our team!”</p>
<p>Trump on Saturday named Kash Patel to lead the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, saying he “is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and
‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption,
defending justice, and protecting the American people.” </p>
<p>Patel, 44, held three defense, intelligence and national security
posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the
incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the “deep state” at the
FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against
Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the
once-and-future president, journalists and others.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI
director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic,
said the appointment would only occur “over my dead body.”</p>
<p>Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and
dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not
launch more intelligence-gathering operations.</p>
<p>Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that
there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by
Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027.</p>
<p>Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before
Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms
by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not
subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired
one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray.</p>
<p>Trump says the FBI is “badly broken” and has “lost the confidence of
America.”</p>
<p>Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough
questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than
10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff
members.</p>
<p>Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump
appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the
health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a
decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the
Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a
Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of
national intelligence.</p>
<p>Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt
Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of
his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has
denied.</p>
<p>Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans
will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could
lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice
President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if
needed.</p>
<p>Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s “Meet the
Press” that Patel “represents the type of change that we need to see in
the FBI. … The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.”</p>
<p>“There are serious problems at the FBI,” Hagerty said. “The American
public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel’s
just the type of person to do it.”</p>
<p>Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a “very
strong nominee” and he thought Patel would be confirmed.</p>
<p>“All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling
their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a
real reformer come into the FBI,” Cruz told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, “Every
president wants people that are loyal to themselves.” But he called Wray
“a very good man,” adding, “I don’t have any complaints about the way
that he’s done his job right now.”</p>
<p>Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, “Patel’s only qualification is that he
agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish,
lock up and intimidate Donald Trump’s political opponents.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

id="moana-2-has-record-221-million-opening-hollywood-celebrates-moviegoing-feast">‘Moana
2’ has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing
feast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. “Moana
2” brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day
weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to
studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with “Wicked” and “Gladiator
II,” made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of
blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December.</p>
<p>Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” but the film
— originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to
the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening
set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was
$125 million for “Frozen 2” in its second week of release in 2019.)
“Moana 2” added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million
worldwide, it’s the second-best global launch of the year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the sensation of “Wicked” showed no signs of
slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million
over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2
million. Not accounting for inflation, “Wicked” is now the highest
grossing Broadway adaptation over “Grease.” (That 1978 film grossed $190
million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)</p>
<p>“Gladiator II,” meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its
opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture
original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep
price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging,
“Gladiator II” has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420
million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to
Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry
that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages
and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that
showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before
“Wicked,” “Moana 2” and “Gladiator II” arrived in theaters, ticket sales
were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National
Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible
when “all the pieces of the puzzle come together” in compelling
big-budget movies with marketing muscle.</p>
<p>“We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we
believe is a full-on charge into the future,” he said. “The remaining
quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and
2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this
industry has had in a long time.”</p>
<p>Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release
calendar — 2023’s much-ballyhooed “Barbenheimer” — the movie industry
again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all
blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out
most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, “Venom: The Last
Dance,” for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks,
despite not being particularly successful.</p>
<p>“For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you
don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,” said O’Leary.
“But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for
the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners.
But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.”</p>
<p>“Moana 2” was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first
began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when
Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance
between theatrical and streaming. The original “Moana,” after all, was
the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of
$680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger
announce the release of “Moana 2,” with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne
Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.</p>
<p>“It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not
adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,” says Paul
Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Whoever made that
decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,’ that was one of the
greatest decisions ever.”</p>
<p>And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two
animated November releases — “Strange World” and “Wish” — fizzled in
theaters. “Moana 2” may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for
the studio in 2024, along with “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp;
Wolverine.” Though reviews for “Moana 2” have only been 65% “fresh” on
Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore.</p>
<p>“Moana 2” is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing.
According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a
newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is
going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly
the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.</p>
<p>After such large debuts, “Moana 2” and “Wicked” are likely to
continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be
if this year’s Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday
period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup.
Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney’s “Mufasa:
The Lion King,” Paramount’s “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” and Searchlight’s “A
Complete Unknown,” with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Moana 2,” $135 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Wicked,” $80 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Gladiator II” $30.7 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Red One,” $12.9 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,” $3.3 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,” $2.4 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Venom: The Last Dance,” $2.2 million.</p></li>
<li><p>“Heretic,” $956,797.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Wild Robot,” $670,000.</p></li>

snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOWVILLE, N.Y. — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts
of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend
draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers
and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather
forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in
Buffalo.</p>
<p>In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect
snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time,
there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area.</p>
<p>“We just keep digging out,” Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said
Sunday. “We were out all day yesterday, plowing.”</p>
<p>Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck
for much of the winter, “and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a
snowblower.”</p>
<p>His advice? “If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow
down.”</p>
<p>Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night </p>
<p>In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow
shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against
the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and
provide food and hot drinks.</p>
<p>A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’
stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the
stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather
Risk Communication Center in New York.</p>
<p>“Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake
effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over
the stadium longer,” the center said in a post on the social media site
X.</p>
<p>Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border</p>
<p>Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and
15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New
York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey
tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19
hours, stuck inside Schintzius’ Honda Pilot.</p>
<p>The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first
on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and
again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by
some residents.</p>
<p>“There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of
people, tons,” Schintzius said by phone Sunday.</p>
<p>While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid
it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to
check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in,
along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of
muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had
water.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,” said
Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and
fruit. “And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.”</p>
<p>When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned
around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow
that was still falling.</p>
<p>“We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m
not getting stuck in that ever again,” she said.</p>
<p>Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures</p>
<p>A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of
10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees
Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather
Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota.
Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by
Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius)
below average.</p>
<p>Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy
lake-effect snow has produced “treacherous” conditions that are causing
even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to
clear city roads.</p>
<p>The city estimated Sunday morning that there were “about 100 cars
throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of
the way so plows can get through.”</p>
<p>Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in
western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the
Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow
was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday,
with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible.</p>
<p>New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies</p>
<p>In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy
Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying
snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility
providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state
to assist.</p>
<p>“I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle,
but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make
sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy
holiday weekend,” she said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency
proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest
received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday
night.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during
the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials
said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound
lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Michigan battered by lake-effect snow</p>
<p>Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens
when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air
overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the
Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette,
Michigan.</p>
<p>Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for
holiday travel on Sunday. </p>
<p>“Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow
bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,” the
National Weather Service said Sunday.</p>
<p>There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the
Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in
Munising, in the eastern area. </p>
<p>Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the
eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25
centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday.</p>
<p>Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a
new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts,
said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous
record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942.</p>
<p>Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord,
said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time
year, “but that magnitude certainly is not.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,” he
added.</p>
<p>The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32
hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base
that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort’s season
opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said.</p>
<p>“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow
hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,”
Hoeh said.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has approved a so-called sanctuary city ordinance. It’s a
response to President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations
when he assumes the presidency in January. The ordinance won’t stop
federal officials from deporting undocumented immigrants, but it

<h2 id="us-will-not-return-nuclear-weapons-to-ukraine">US will not
return nuclear weapons to Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear
weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.</p>
<p>Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times
article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had
suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he
leaves office.</p>
<p>“That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging
various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively
defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them]
nuclear capability,” he told ABC.</p>
<p>Last week, Russia said the idea was “absolute insanity” and that
preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops
into Ukraine.</p>
<p>Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991
collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest
Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United
States and Britain.</p>

id="biden-to-spotlight-angolas-lobito-corridor-his-legacy-to-counter-china-in-africa">Biden
to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in
Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola this week,
he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at
securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the
Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s
strategy to counter China’s clout in global development.</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple
sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer
Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of
Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in
its second phase, to Zambia.</p>
<p>Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes
from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI
is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest
economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in
2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
<p>Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the
United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are
essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S.
congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned.
China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals,
including 76% of its cobalt.</p>
<p>The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open
access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic
growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the
U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters.</p>
<p>The PGI’s investments will “amplify the impact of that
infrastructure” with projects such as developing solar energy, local
electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said.</p>
<p>The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola
owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt.
The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans,
backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following
three decades of civil war that ended in 2002.</p>
<p>PGI to counter BRI</p>
<p>Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China
has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa,
Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and
seven regional institutions.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure
projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis,
while the U.S. provided $76 billion.</p>
<p>The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims
to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure
financing models that are “often opaque, fail to uphold environmental
and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries
worse off.”</p>
<p>That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito
is “the first and the most developed” project in that effort, said
Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.</p>
<p>“That’s the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other
projects,” Schneidman told VOA.</p>
<p>The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to
support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in
the Philippines.</p>
<p>In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon,
the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as
semiconductors.</p>
<p>The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled
back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors.</p>
<p>“We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a
part of the larger G7,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA
during a briefing last month.</p>
<p>“And that’s not just been for two corridors,” he said. “That’s been
for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.”</p>
<p>US-Africa strategy</p>
<p>In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy
that “reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security
interests,” the strategy says.</p>
<p>Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where
he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three
years.</p>
<p>“We are overdelivering on that thus far,” Frances Brown, senior
director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a
briefing Tuesday. “We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.”</p>
<p>But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs
and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is “visible to the
average African that says the United States financed that in the way
that the Chinese do,” said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is
the “one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is
implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’”</p>
<p>On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses
and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin
in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s
a start.</p>
<p>Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and
environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese
financing.</p>
<p>“We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the
process,” said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of
Angola.</p>
<p>So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but
they are ready to ensure that local communities can “share as much as
possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>Will it continue?</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some
are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his
America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his
first administration.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an
initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help
investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue
Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure
infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards.</p>
<p>They were aware that infrastructure investments needed “to foster
economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests
globally when competing with China,” said Joseph Lemoine, senior
director of the Atlantic Council’s Freedom and Prosperity Center. “I’m
hopeful that they will continue those efforts,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s
development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity.</p>
<p>DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s
son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to
foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2
billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump
administration’s Abraham Accords and recognize Israel.</p>
<p>“If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy
that’s transactional,” Schneidman at Brookings said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China.
Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s
foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that
developing nations can leverage.</p>

id="eggs-are-available-but-pricier-as-the-holiday-baking-season-begins">Eggs
are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird
flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season.</p>
<p>But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two
years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages
at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far.</p>
<p>“Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day,” said
Emily Metz, the Egg Board’s president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in
October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down
slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when
the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023,
when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07.</p>
<p>Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During
testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission’s case seeking to
block Kroger’s merger with Albertsons, Kroger’s senior director for
pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and
eggs beyond the levels of inflation.</p>
<p>But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the
egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for
example.</p>
<p>“You can’t have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing,
without eggs,” she said.</p>
<p>Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The
current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the
slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens.
Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the
spread of the disease.</p>
<p>More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month
because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S.
egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about
3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs
because California has been among the hardest hit states. California,
Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to
be cage-free.</p>
<p>“We’re having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are
producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because
those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,” Metz said.</p>
<p>Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado
and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.</p>
<p>Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu,
which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past
farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk,
said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State
University.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to control that interaction between domesticated
birds and wild birds,” Hart said. “Some of those vectors have been
opened up because we’re asking the egg industry to produce in ways that
we didn’t ask them to before.”</p>
<p>Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some
wild birds off course.</p>
<p>“We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires,
and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might
not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be
circulating,” she said. “And those are all new variables that our
farmers are having to deal with.”</p>
<p>Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that
also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to
hatch into new chickens.</p>
<p>Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of
chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer’s costs — has fallen
significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.</p>

id="more-sand-is-in-sight-for-a-jersey-shore-resort-towns-deteriorating-beaches">More
sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town’s deteriorating
beaches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the
condition of a New Jersey resort town’s beaches, involving tens of
millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end
soon.  </p>
<p>Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has
reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures
to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the
Philadelphia area.  </p>
<p>The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood’s
council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the
Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is
sometime in 2025, he said.  </p>
<p>The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined
North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could
actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit
against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent
trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach
over the past decade.   </p>
<p>“We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead
of suing each other,” Rosenello said Wednesday.  </p>
<p>At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is
virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full
beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property
owners has contributed to the delay.  </p>
<p>Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective
sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to
flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in
January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a
dune barely reaching his knees.  </p>
<p>The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment
project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the
erosion in North Wildwood “shocking.” Rosenello said that work has held
up well in the ensuing months.  </p>
<p>The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed
agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and
signed and sent to the state Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute
$1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment
project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state
water pollution control fund, the mayor said.  </p>
<p>The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North
Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other
shore protection work including extension of a sea wall.  </p>
<p>On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs,
including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the
state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection
commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have
more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of
future shore protection funding.</p>

id="us-proposes-new-habitat-protections-in-southern-rockies-for-canada-lynx">US
proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada
lynx</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan
for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new
habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the
forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald
Trump: Officials during the Republican’s first term sought
unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they’ve had since 2000
under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado
and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That’s
different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and
concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming,
Montana, Minnesota and Maine.</p>
<p>“This is a significant change and a good one,” said Matthew Bishop,
an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved
in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. “They weren’t really
committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are.”</p>
<p>Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana.
Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday’s
proposal.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they
consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas
that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term
survival.</p>
<p>Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey
primarily on snowshoe hares.</p>
<p>They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest
Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn’t have sufficient
regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm.
Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged
as a new, worsening threat.</p>
<p>Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx’s snowy habitat and
could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are
expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic
warming scenario that officials have considered.</p>
<p>Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the
animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed.</p>
<p>Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at
the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain
some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world.</p>
<p>The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that
faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for
lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho.</p>
<p>There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to
estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some
areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population
of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period.</p>
<p>More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999
and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain.</p>
<p>“There were concerns about whether it would stick,” said U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. “But they do seem to be
hanging on.”</p>
<p>Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds,
with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone
National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for
the longest time, he said.</p>
<p>Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by
climate change.</p>
<p>“We’ve got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want
to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control,”
Zelenak said. “So we don’t want to put roads in the wrong places. We
don’t want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the
hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming
future.”</p>
<p>Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged
under the proposal.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected late next year.</p>

id="president-elect-trump-has-sought-orbans-take-on-ukraine-war-sources-say">President-elect
Trump has sought Orban’s take on Ukraine war, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone
conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning
the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to
RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service.</p>
<p>Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on
ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s
full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that
the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its
invasion.</p>
<p>He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the
White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that
Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.</p>
<p>Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and
has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow.</p>
<p>Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second
crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU
presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure
started.</p>
<p>In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow
to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire
proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled
to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on
the presidential campaign trail.</p>
<p>Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but
sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve
delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President
Xi Jinping.</p>

<h2 id="trump-set-to-nominate-former-prosecutor-to-head-fbi">Trump set
to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he wanted
former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the
FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau’s current director,
Christopher Wray.</p>
<p>Patel, who during Trump’s first term advised both the director of
national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously
called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and
purging its ranks of any employee who refuses to support Trump’s
agenda.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem the FBI has had, has come out of its intel
shops. I’d break that component out of it. I’d shut down the FBI Hoover
building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep
state,” Patel said in a September interview on the conservative “Shawn
Ryan Show.”</p>
<p>“And I’d take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send
them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You’re cops. Go
be cops.”</p>
<p>With the nomination of Patel, Trump, a Republican, seems to be
preparing to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump. Wray’s
10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027.</p>
<p>Asked about Patel’s nomination, which will need Senate confirmation,
an FBI spokesperson said on Saturday: “Every day, the men and women of
the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of
threats. Director Wray’s focus remains on the men and women of the FBI,
the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.”</p>
<p>FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of
insulating the bureau from politics.</p>
<p>Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for
investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump
supporters’ ire.</p>
<p>During Wray’s tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at
Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He also has
faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney
General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards
from violent threats and harassment.</p>
<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions
against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining
classified documents, asked on November 25 the judges overseeing those
cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a
Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.</p>
<p>Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and
was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a
person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Patel, 44, previously worked as a federal public defender and a
federal prosecutor.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans’ probe into
the FBI’s 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign
and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence
Committee Chair Devin Nunes.</p>
<p>Later, during Trump’s first impeachment trial, ex-National Security
Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned
Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine
without authorization.</p>
<p>Patel denied those allegations.</p>
<p>After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several
people Trump designated as a representative for access to his
presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration
officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all
of the records in question.</p>
<p>He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection
with the probe.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, Trump named Chad Chronister, the sheriff of
Hillsborough County, Florida, as his choice for administrator of the
Drug Enforcement Agency. In that role, Chronister would work closely
with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.</p>
<p>Bondi is from the Tampa area that Chronister serves.</p>
<p>“As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney
General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and
other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,” Trump
wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>Trump also named real estate mogul Charles Kushner to serve as U.S.
ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump son-in-law Jared
Kushner.</p>
<p>“He (Charles Kushner) is a tremendous business leader,
philanthropist, &amp; dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate
representing our Country &amp; its interests,” Trump said in a post on
Truth Social announcing the pick.</p>

id="biden-makes-historic-first-visit-by-us-president-to-angola">Biden
makes historic first visit by US president to Angola</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is “excited” to make his
first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop
briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall
in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official
told VOA Friday.</p>
<p>“He is excited and really looking forward to the trip,” Frances
Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security
Council, told VOA at the White House. “I think the president really sees
this as a way to sum up all that he’s tried to put forward during this
administration on our Africa strategy.”</p>
<p>While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on
bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and
on improving technological and scientific cooperation.</p>
<p>“He sees Angola as the perfect place for this,” she said.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden’s vow to visit Africa —
made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola
in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing
down on the eastern United States.</p>
<p>“I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his
administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of
his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather
hollow,” Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed
development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which
connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The
U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment
on the project.</p>
<p>When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola’s many
documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced
by Biden administration officials, saying: “he never shies away from
talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts.”</p>
<p>The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a
way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the
Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity
for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a
flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime,” he said.</p>
<p>He added, “That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess,
mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the
visit by saying that the Biden administration isn’t just stopping in one
African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the
other side of the democracy spectrum.”</p>
<p>Angola’s president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the
African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil
giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and
far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African “coup belt.”
This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden’s core beliefs as he prepares
to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and
problem-solvers.</p>
<p>While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees
the future of relations between Washington and the continent.</p>
<p>“I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African
leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that’s
why he’ll be amplifying Angola’s role mediating in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and elsewhere,” she said. “And I think he wants to
convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which
is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the
U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.”</p>

names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US
ambassador</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday
he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles
Kushner “a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, &amp;
dealmaker.”</p>
<p>Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm.
Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is
married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka.</p>
<p>The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after
pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign
donations.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his
brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an
investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation.</p>
<p>Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged
to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden
camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife,
prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion
and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison —
the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris
Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later
governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.</p>
<p>Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s
transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses “one
of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was
U.S. attorney.”</p>
<p>Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles
and their children were married in 2009.</p>

Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up
two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said
Saturday. </p>
<p>Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others
were offered transit papers. </p>
<p>The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump
threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country
does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum
had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the
United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day
that “migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the
border.” </p>
<p>Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of
the two caravans appeared to be part of “an agreement between the
president of Mexico and the president of the United States.” </p>
<p>The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city
of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day
Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost
four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to
Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. </p>
<p>In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired
migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central
Mexico. </p>
<p>“They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from
our group to Oaxaca city,” said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition
supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country’s contested
presidential elections earlier this year. </p>
<p>Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to
Mexico City. </p>
<p>The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and
made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in
Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that
allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. </p>
<p>Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United
States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a
phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. </p>
<p>Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which
were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever
reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way,
though some individual members have made it. </p>
<p>For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or
prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents.
They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the
Guatemalan border.</p>

id="snow-blankets-parts-of-us-during-busy-holiday-travel-weekend">Snow
blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed
towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday
travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to
persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and
Midwest regions. </p>
<p>The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of
New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials
warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to
return home. </p>
<p>“Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend,
especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very
quickly,” the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of
the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61
centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and
29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania’s northwestern
tip. </p>
<p>With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania,
scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a
fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley
said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened
the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. </p>
<p>“It was hard to manage, but we had no choice,” he said. “They just
showed up, and we don’t want to turn people away.” </p>
<p>Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning
as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. </p>
<p>“Everyone helped each other,” he said. “It was pretty cool.” </p>
<p>This week’s blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20
degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather
service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. </p>
<p>Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United
States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. </p>
<p>Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens
when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air
overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the
past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61
centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service’s office in Marquette, Michigan. </p>
<p>Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just
northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, she
said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern
part of the peninsula. </p>
<p>Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot
(30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday
morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the
west. </p>
<p>Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord,
Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day
record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said
Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Gaylord office.
The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9,
1942. </p>
<p>The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80
acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809
hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort’s director of recreation. It
boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the
coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. </p>
<p>“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow
hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,”
Hoeh said. “But we’re close to being ready to pull the trigger on
skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps.” </p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of
disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state’s
northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more
expected through Monday night. </p>
<p>State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour
period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.</p>
