Federal Emergency Management Agency crews working hurricane recovery
efforts paused aid in parts of North Carolina over the weekend after
threats were made against workers and an armed suspect was arrested. We
talk about the rise of misinformation around FEMA’s response to
Hurricanes Helene and Milton, including falsehoods pushed by former
President Donald Trump. And, we discuss an atmosphere of political
violence as Trump urges using the military on Election Day. Plus, are we
one step closer to commercial space travel?

of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested outside New York Stock
Exchange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel’s war in Gaza
were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday,
police said. </p>
<p>The protesters chanted “Let Gaza live!” And “Up up with liberation,
down down with occupation!” in front of the stock exchange’s landmark
building in lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>“The reason we’re here is to demand that the U.S. government stop
sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide
against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Beth Miller, political director of
Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration.
“Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using
U.S. bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons
manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices
skyrocket.” </p>
<p>A handful of counter protesters waved Israeli flags and tried to
shout down the pro-Palestinian chants. </p>
<p>None of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but
at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they
sat down and waited to be taken into custody. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the
protest. </p>
<p>Police arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind
their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some
demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers. </p>
<p>A police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not
have details on the charges they faced. </p>
<p>The protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of
Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s
retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and
beyond. </p>
<p>The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment
building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and it was
not clear what the target was.</p>

id="trumps-campaign-crowdfunded-millions-online-in-untraditional-approach-to-emergency-relief">Trump’s
campaign crowdfunded millions online in untraditional approach to
emergency relief</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is using GoFundMe
to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around
the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene’s
destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief. </p>
<p>The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican
nominee’s national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million.
They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts.
Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political
ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the
majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed. </p>
<p>But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response
to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party’s
presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually
features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical
bills — to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty unusual and actually quite odd,” said Brett Kappel, a
longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised
both Republicans and Democrats. </p>
<p>It’s more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to
IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He
pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show U.S. Senator
Tim Scott’s 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane
Ian hit South Carolina. </p>
<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the motivation arose
from “the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to
give as much direct support as they can.” </p>
<p>The finance team only got involved because of their “great expertise
in working with large accounts,” according to Hughes, and “not one penny
of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted.” Hughes said
more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations
helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of
Oct. 11. </p>
<p>“The president has an amazing movement of supporters,” Hughes told
AP. “With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of
support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a
philanthropic effort from his supporters.” </p>
<p>Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing
groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the
Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the
assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC
President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Republican U.S. Senator
Rick Scott said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional
salary for the Butler, Pennsylvania victims. Also contributing was The
Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project
2025. </p>
<p>GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every
donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust &amp;
Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith
O’Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler,
Pennsylvania, page, according to a company spokesperson. O’Rourke also
provided a verified distribution plan, the GoFundMe spokesperson told
AP, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are
withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients. </p>
<p>Lawyer advises against </p>
<p>It’s not advisable for campaign finance officials to run crowdfunding
pages “at the same time they were writing your money for your camp,”
said Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign
finance. Because online crowdfunding is less regulated, he said, it
would’ve been “more palatable” to direct supporters toward a recognized
nonprofit. </p>
<p>“But people get into trouble when they try to ascribe rationality or
any degree of what we would generally consider best financial practices
to campaigns,” Herman said. </p>
<p>“There’s no black letter law that says they can’t do this,” he added.
“Should they? Of course not.” </p>
<p>The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made earlier this
month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active,
according to Hughes. The “vast majority” has gone to the families of the
three people shot, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane
rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing
police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he’d donated
for the rally. </p>
<p>Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four
nonprofits. Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson Gabrielle Bouquet said the
Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump’s
“steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus’ name.” Bouquet declined
to share the exact amount of the donation. </p>
<p>Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe
water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the South
Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations
director Gregg Dinino did not specify the total. </p>
<p>Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the
immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received
$25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds
were used to buy South Georgia businesses’ gift cards because “the best
way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their
hands.” </p>
<p>‘Combustible dynamic’ </p>
<p>It makes sense that Trump’s team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said
Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and
Philanthropy. The campaign “has often been premised on a suspicion of
institutions,” he said, and GoFundMe “drew some of its attraction by
serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving.” </p>
<p>But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said.
Crowdfunding pages don’t have the same disclosure requirements as public
charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings. </p>
<p>Soskis said Trump’s checkered philanthropic ventures have likely
brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in
2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his
interests. </p>
<p>“It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and
charitable giving,” Soskis said. “The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and
Trump’s own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that
fire.”</p>

Latest Nobel Winner Has a Different Approach to Solving Climate
Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgxMzg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDY1OTA3NH0.SIQRUwklku7chDrVyRMYxIbq_hT-3f5TxfUig1CFhWQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
This year’s Economics Nobel is not a climate prize — that happened in
2018, when Yale economist William Nordhaus won the prize for his work on
modeling the effects of climate change and economic growth together,
providing the intellectual basis for carbon taxation and more generally
for regulating greenhouse gas emissions because of the “social cost”
they impose on everyone.
</p>
<p>
Instead, this year’s prize, awarded to MIT’s Daron Acemoglu and Simon
Johnson and University of Chicago’s James Robinson is for their work
demonstrating “the importance of societal institutions for a country’s
prosperity,” i.e. why some countries are rich and others are poor. To do
so, the trio looked at the history of those countries’ institutions —
laws, modes of government, relationship between the state and
individuals — and drew out which are conducive to wealth and which lead
to poverty.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, “extractive” institutions set up to reward a narrow
elite tend to hurt economic development over time, as in
<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/colonial-origins-of-comparative-development.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much
of Africa</u></a>, which was colonized by Europeans who didn’t actually
live there. “Inclusive” institutions, by contrast, arose in the United
States and Canada, where there was significantly more European
migration, thus incentivizing the ruling elite to set up institutions
that benefitted a broader range of (again, European) residents.
</p>
<p>
While this research rests heavily on <em><em>the climate</em></em> (the
reason Europeans avoided African colonies was because of the high rate
of disease in tropical climates), it does not touch on <em><em>climate
change</em></em> specifically. But Acemoglu especially is an incredibly
wide-ranging scholar and has devoted some time to the specific questions
of climate change — and in so doing has been a direct critic of
Nordhaus, Stockholm’s preferred climate economist.
</p>
<p>
“Existing approaches in economics still do not provide the right
framework for managing the problems that will confront us over the next
several decades,”
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/what-climate-change-requires-of-economics-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-09" target="_blank"><u>Acemoglu
wrote</u></a> in a 2021 essay titled “What Climate Change Requires of
Economics,” referring directly to Nordhaus’s Nobel-winning work.
“Although the economics discipline has evolved over time to acknowledge
environmental risks and costs, it has yet to rise to the challenge of
climate change. A problem as massive as this one will require a
fundamental reconsideration of some of the field’s most deeply held
assumptions.”
</p>
<p>
His criticisms included that Nordhaus’s more gradualistic approach —
<a href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2024-03/barrage-nordhaus-2024-policies-projections-and-the-social-cost-of-carbon-results-from-the-dice-2023-model.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
latest version of his model</u></a> spits out that a 1.5 degree Celsius
warming target is “infeasible,” and the “cost vs. benefit optimal”
amount of warming as 2.6 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels with
a carbon price that rises to $115 per ton by 2050 — ignores both the
best way to reduce emissions and the risk of not doing so fast enough.
</p>
<p>
Acemoglu is far more optimistic about how policy can direct
technological development and less sanguine about additional warming
over and above the Paris Agreement limits. He argues that the
possibility of theoretical
“<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tipping
points</u></a>,” where exceeding
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Eb4u07ljUreXRyc2NnRXQ5RkE/view?resourcekey=0-LT7b_pQG5krLrO6DU5yKlg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>certain
climate thresholds</u></a> by even a small amount may cause dramatic
damages, make the risk of such overshoot far too great.
</p>
<p>
He also took issue with the discount rate applied to spending later
vs. spending now in Nordhaus’s models. The basic idea is that a dollar
spent today to mitigate the effects of climate change is more valuable
than one spent in 2050. But the rates Nordhaus uses — which he derives
from real-world investment returns — implies that in order for spending
now to be worth it later, the benefits in 2050 or 2100 must be very,
very large.
</p>
<p>
“There is a plausible economic (and philosophical) case to be made for
why future essential public goods should be valued differently than
private goods or other types of public consumption,” Acemoglu wrote in
2021, arguing that discount rates derived from investment returns,
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/nepa/119017/175400/213681/Exhibit_20_Nordhaus_PNAS_2017-1518-23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like
the ones Nordhaus uses</u></a>, might not be the best guide to public
policy.
</p>
<p>
So what does the latest Nobel laureate want instead? Well, something
like what the United States has been doing the past few
years.<br/><br/>Accounting for the economic benefits of domestic or
“endogenous” technological development, Acemoglu’s research finds that
“the transition to cleaner energy is much more important than simply
reducing energy consumption, and that technological interventions need
to be redirected far more aggressively than they have been.” He explored
how this process could work in papers he wrote over more than a decade,
developing a model for this kind of directed technological change and
applying it to the United States, starting as far back as 2012.
</p>
<p>
Across all his work on climate change, Acemoglu argues that a focus on
pricing the “externalities” of carbon emissions — the harm emissions
impose on everyone that isn’t reflected in the prices of fossil fuels —
is myopic. Instead, the challenge is both restricting emissions
<em><em>and</em></em> fostering clean technologies that can take the
place of dirty ones, which have had a remarkable head start in
investment.
</p>
<p>
In
“<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Environment%20and%20Directed%20Technical%20Change.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Environment and Directed Technical Change</u></a>,” published in 2012
and co-written with Philippe Aghion, Leonardo Bursztyn, and David
Hemous, Acemoglu argues that a mixture of carbon taxes and research
subsides could “redirect technical change and avoid an environmental
disaster” by imposing a cost on dirty technology and boosting clean
technology.<br/><br/>Such an approach would probably rest heavily on
positive subsidies and encouraging clean technology and less on a carbon
tax, the four write (although a carbon tax would still help to
“discourage research” into polluting technologies). It would also need
to happen soon.
</p>
<p>
“Directed technical change also calls for immediate and decisive action
in contrast to the implications of several exogenous technology models
used in previous economic analyses.”
</p>
<p>
This framework does not precisely match United States policy — we have
no carbon tax — but it does somewhat approximate it. The Biden
administration’s approach to climate policy centers on large-scale
investments in clean technologies, whether they’re tax credits for
non-carbon-emitting electricity production or financing for clean energy
projects from the Loan Programs Office, combined with a suite of
Environmental Protection Agency rules that are intended to reduce
pollution from fossil fuel power plants (along with an actual direct fee
on methane emissions).
</p>
<p>
This approach is embedded within an overall industrial policy that’s
supposed to make the economy more productive — a counter-argument to the
idea that climate spending is an economic drag that trades off with
environmental harms in the future. Acemoglu, too, questions the idea
that there’s a tradeoff between economic growth and spending to combat
climate change. Not only could renewables be cheaper than fossil fuels,
“an energy transition can improve productive capacity and thus lead to
an expansion of output, because transition to cleaner technologies can
boost investment and the rate of technological progress,” he and his
co-authors write.
</p>
<p>
Acemoglu has also weighed in on one the more controversial questions in
climate policy and economics: the shale gas boom.
<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-08/Climate%20Change%2C%20Directed%20Innovation%2C%20and%20Energy%20Transistion%20-%20The%20Long-run%20Consequences%20of%20the%20Shale%20Gas%20Revolution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
a 2023 paper</u></a> written, again with Aghion, Hemous, and Lint
Barrage, he weighed the effects of dramatic increase of domestically
extracted natural gas, focusing on the importance of technological
development. The Environmental Protection Agency attributes the decline
in US greenhouse gas emissions since 2010
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
part to</u></a> “the growing use of natural gas and renewables to
generate electricity in place of more carbon-intensive fuels,” due to
natural gas replacing coal electricity generation. While this logic has
come under fire from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>some
activists and researchers</u></a> who say the government’s models
underestimate methane leakage from natural gas operations, Acemoglu took
a different tack.
</p>
<p>
Yes, natural gas substituting for coal reduces short-run emissions, he
and his co-authors concluded, but also, “the natural gas boom
discourages innovation directed at clean energy, which delays and can
even permanently prevent the energy transition to zero carbon.” They
backed up this assertion by pointing to a decline in the total share of
patents rewarded to renewable energy innovation between 2009 and 2016.
</p>
<p>
The way out is that same mix of carbon prices and technology subsidies
Acemoglu has been recommending in some form since
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kelly
Clarkson was last on top of the charts</u></a>, which “enables emission
reductions in the short run, while optimal policy would ensure that the
long-run green transition is not disrupted.”
</p>
<p>
If the Biden Administration’s climate policy works out, it will look
something like that, and the prize will be far greater than anything
given out in Stockholm.

Ledbetter, American icon of the fight for equal pay, dies at 86</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Lilly Ledbetter, an former Alabama factory manager whose
lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement
and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, has died at 86.</p>
<p>Ledbetter’s discovery that she was earning less than her male
counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber
Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when
the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too
late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months
of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter’s case,
years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous
letter.</p>
<p>Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue
within 180 days of receiving each discrimination paycheck, not just the
first one.</p>
<p>“Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household
name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,”
Obama said in a statement Monday. “Lilly did what so many Americans
before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even
higher for her children and grandchildren.”</p>
<p>Ledbetter died Saturday of respiratory failure, according to a
statement from her family cited by the Alabama news site AL.com.</p>
<p>Ledbetter continued campaigning for equal pay for decades after
winning the law named after her. A film about her life starring Patricia
Clarkson premiered last week at the Hamptons International Film
Festival.</p>
<p>The team behind the film, “LILLY,” issued a statement of condolence
on social media.</p>
<p>“Lilly was an ordinary woman who achieved extraordinary things, and
her story continues to motivate us all. We will miss her,” the team
said.</p>
<p>In January, President Joe Biden marked the 15th anniversary of the
law named after Ledbetter with new measures to help close the gender
wage gap, including a new rule barring the federal government from
considering a person’s current or past pay when determining their
salary.</p>
<p>Ledbetter had advocated for the measure in a January opinion piece
for Ms. Magazine penned with Deborah Vagins, director of the Equal Pay
Today advocacy group. But Ledbetter and other advocates for years have
been frustrated that more comprehensive initiatives have stalled,
including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the Equal
Pay Act of 1963.</p>
<p>The sense of urgency among advocates deepened after an annual report
from the Census Bureau last month found that the gender wage gap between
men and women widened for the first time 20 years. In 2023, women
working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared with men, down
from 84 cents in 2022.</p>
<p>Even before then, advocates had been frustrated that wage gap
improvement had mostly stalled for the last 20 years despite women
making gains in the C-suite and earning college degrees at a faster rate
than men. Experts say the reasons for the enduring gap are multifaceted,
including the overrepresentation of women in lower-paying industries and
weak childcare system that pushes many women to step back from their
careers in their peak earnings years.</p>
<p>In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Ledbetter wrote a
opinion piece in The New York Times detailing the harassment she faced
as a manager at the Goodyear factory and drawing a link between
workplace sexual harassment and pay discrimination.</p>
<p>“She was indefatigable,” said Emily Martin, chief program officer at
the National Women’s Law Center, which worked closely with Ledbetter.
“She was always ready to lend her voice, to show up to do a video, to
write an op-ed. She was always ready to go.”</p>
<p>Ledbetter was a manager at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama,
and had worked there 19 years when she received an anonymous note saying
she was being paid significantly less than three male colleagues.</p>
<p>She filed a lawsuit in 1999 and initially won $3.8 million in backpay
and damages from a federal court. She never received the money after
eventually losing her case before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Although the law named after her didn’t directly address the gender
wage gap, Martin said it set an important precedent “for ensuring that
we don’t just have the promise of equal pay on the books but we have a
way to enforce the law.”</p>
<p>“She is a really an inspiration in showing us how a loss does not
mean you can’t win,” Martin said. “We know her name because she lost,
and she lost big, and she kept coming back from it and kept working
until the day she died to change that loss into real gains for women
across the country.”</p>

<h2 id="should-you-trust-zillows-climate-risk-data">Should You Trust
Zillow’s Climate Risk Data?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNjEyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzg2NzA0MX0.IuTgnZtC9B-bQRjBXhSdkhjA_3RtXxsbltebzvPLUkc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Starting this month, the tens of millions of Americans who browse the
real-estate listings website Zillow will encounter a new type of
information.
</p>
<p>
In addition to disclosing a home’s square footage, school district, and
walkability score, Zillow will begin to tell users about its
<em><em>climate risk </em></em>— the chance that a major weather or
climate event will strike in the next 30 years. It will focus on the
risk from five types of dangers: floods, wildfires, high winds, heat,
and air quality.
</p>
<p>
The data has the potential to transform how Americans think about buying
a home, especially because climate change will likely worsen many of
those dangers. About 70% of Americans look at Zillow at some point
during the process of buying a home,
<a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/corp/about/#:~:text=Zillow's%20ecosystem%20of%20products%20and,some%20point%20in%20their%20transaction." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the company</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,”
Skylar Olsen, Zillow’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Healthy
markets are ones where buyers and sellers have access to all relevant
data for their decisions.”
</p>
<p>
That’s true — if the information is accurate. But can homebuyers
actually trust Zillow’s climate risk data? When climate experts have
looked closely at the underlying data Zillow uses to assess climate
risk, they have walked away unconvinced.
</p>
<p>
Zillow’s climate risk data comes from
<a href="https://firststreet.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>First
Street Technology</u></a>, a New York-based company that uses computer
models to estimate the risk that weather and climate change pose to
homes and buildings. It is far and away the most prominent company
focused on modeling the physical risks of climate change. (Although it
was initially established as a nonprofit foundation,
<a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-announces-new-structure-investment-partners-and-advisor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First
Street <u>reorganized</u></a> as a for-profit company and
<a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-finalizes-a-46-million-series-a-to-scale-breakthrough-advancements-in-physical-climate-risk-modeling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accepted</u></a>
$46 million in investment earlier this year.)
</p>
<p>
But few experts believe that tools like First Street’s are capable of
actually modeling the dangers of climate change at a
property-by-property level. A report from a team of White House
scientific advisors
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PCAST_Extreme-Weather-Report_April2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concluded</u></a>
last year that these models are of “questionable quality,” and a
<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>investigation
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that different climate risk models could return wildly different
catastrophe estimates for the same property.
</p>
<p>
Not all of First Street’s data is seen as equally suspect. Its estimates
of heat and air pollution risk have generally attracted less criticism
from experts. But its estimates of flooding and wildfire risk — which
are the most catastrophic events for homeowners — are generally thought
to be inadequate at best.
</p>
<p>
So while Zillow will soon tell you with seeming precision that a certain
home has a 1.1% chance of facing a wildfire in the next 30 years,
potential homebuyers should take that kind of estimate with “a lot of
grains of salt,” Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at the Stanford
Woods Institute for the Environment, told me.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short guide for how to think through Zillow’s estimates of
climate risk.
</p>
<p>
Neither First Street nor Zillow immediately responded to requests for
comment.
</p>
<h3>
If Zillow tells you a property has flooded recently, take it seriously.
</h3>
<p>
Zillow has said that, when the data is available, it will tell users
whether a given home has flooded or burned in a wildfire recently. (It
will also say whether a home is near a source of air pollution.)
</p>
<p>
Homebuyers should take that information seriously,
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/madison-condon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Madison
Condon</u></a>, a Boston University School of Law professor who studies
climate change and financial markets, told me.
</p>
<p>
“If the house flooded in the recent past, then that should be a major
red flag to you,” she said. Houses that have flooded recently are very
likely to flood again, she said.
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joel-scata/growing-nationwide-trend-states-requiring-flood-disclosure#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%2010%20states%20(Florida,their%20flood%20risk%20disclosure%20laws." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Only
10 states</u></a> require a home seller to disclose a flood to a
potential buyer.
</p>
<h3>
Use Zillow’s flood risk assessment as a starting place — but contact the
local government to learn more.
</h3>
<p>
First Street claims that its physics-based models can identify the risk
that any individual property will flood. But the ability to determine
whether a given house will flood depends on having an intricate
knowledge of local infrastructure, including stormwater drains and what
exists on other properties, and that data does not seem to exist in
anyone’s model at the moment, Condon said.
</p>
<p>
When <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compared</u></a>
the output of three different flooding models, including First Street’s,
they agreed on results for only 5% of properties.
</p>
<p>
If you’re worried about a home’s flood risk, then contact the local
government and see if you can look at a flood map or even talk to a
flood manager, Condon said. Many towns and cities keep flood maps in
their records or on their website that are more granular than what First
Street is capable of, she said.
</p>
<p>
“The local flood manager who has walked the property will almost always
have a better grasp of flood risk than the big, top-down national
model,” she said.
</p>
<h3>
Don’t hesitate to buy flood insurance.
</h3>
<p>
In some cases, Zillow will recommend that a home buyer purchase federal
flood insurance. That’s generally not a bad idea, Condon said, even if
Zillow reaches that conclusion using national model data that has errors
or mistakes.
</p>
<p>
“It simply is true that way more people should be buying flood insurance
than generally think they should,” she said. “So a general
overcorrection on that would be good.”
</p>
<h3>
Zillow probably underestimates a home’s wildfire risk, especially out
west.
</h3>
<p>
If you’re looking at buying a home in a wildfire-prone area, especially
in the American West, then you should generally assume that Zillow is
underestimating its wildfire risk, Wara, the Stanford researcher, told
me.
</p>
<p>
That’s because computer models that estimate wildfire risk are in a
fairly early stage of development and improving rapidly. Even the best
academic simulations lack the kind of granular, structure-level data
that would allow them to predict a property’s forward-looking wildfire
risk.
</p>
<p>
That is actually a bigger problem for homebuyers than for insurance
companies, he said. A home insurance company gets to decide whether to
insure a property every year. If it looks at new science and concludes
that a given town or structure is too risky, then it can raise its
premiums or even simply decline to cover a property at all. (State Farm
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-farm-halts-home-insurance-sales-in-california-5748c771" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stopped</u></a>
selling home insurance policies in California last year, partly because
of wildfire risk.)
</p>
<p>
But when homeowners buy a house, their lives and their wealth get locked
into that property for 30 years. “Maybe your kids are going to the
school district,” he said. It’s much harder to sell a home when you
can’t get it covered. “You have an illiquid asset, and it’s a lot harder
to move.”
</p>
<p>
That means First Street’s wildfire risk data should be taken as
“absolute minimum estimate,” Wara said. In a wildfire-prone area, “the
real risk is most likely much higher” than its models say.
</p>
<h3>
Wildfire models are especially bad at predicting the most destructive
types of fires.
</h3>
<p>
Over the past several years, runaway wildland fires have killed dozens
of people or destroyed tens of thousands of homes in
<a href="https://lahainatown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lahaina,
Hawaii</u></a>;
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/777801169/the-camp-fire-destroyed-11-000-homes-a-year-later-only-11-have-been-rebuilt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Paradise,
California</u></a>; and
<a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2024/01/08/looking-back-at-colorados-marshall-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Marshall,
Colorado</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But in those cases, once the fire began incinerating homes, it ceased to
be a wildland fire and became a structure-to-structure fire. The fire
began to leap from house to house like a book of matches, condemning
entire neighborhoods to burn within minutes.
</p>
<p>
Modern computer models do an especially poor job of simulating that
transition — the moment when a wildland fire becomes an urban
conflagration, Wara said. Although it only happens in perhaps 0.5% of
the most intense fires, those fires are responsible for destroying the
most homes.
</p>
<p>
But “how that happens and how to prevent that is not well understood
yet,” he said. “And if they’re not well understood yet from a scientific
perspective, that means it’s not in the [First Street] model.”
</p>
<p>
Nor do the best university wildfire models have good data on every
individual property’s structural-level details — such as what material
its walls or roof
<a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/fire-prevention-education-mitigation/wildfire-mitigation/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
made of</u></a> — that would make it susceptible to fire.
</p>
<h3>
Your whole neighborhood matters when assessing flood or wildfire risk.
</h3>
<p>
When assessing whether your home faces wildfire risk, its structure is
very important. But “you have to know what your neighbor’s houses look
like, too, within about a 250-yard radius. So that’s your whole
neighborhood,” Wara said. “I don’t think anyone has that data.”
</p>
<p>
A similar principle goes for thinking about flood risk, Condon said.
Your home might not flood, she said, but it also matters whether the
roads to your house are still driveable or whether the power lines fail.
“It’s not particularly useful to have a flood-resilient home if your
whole neighborhood gets washed out,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Experts agree that the most important interventions to discourage
wildfire — or, for that matter, floods — have to happen at the community
level. Although few communities are doing prescribed burns or fuel
reduction programs right now, some are, Wara said.
</p>
<p>
But because nobody is collecting data about those programs, national
risk models like First Street’s would not factor those programs into an
area’s wildfire risk, he said. (In the rare case that a government
is<em> </em>clearing fuel or doing a prescribed burn around a town,
wildfire risk there might actually be lower than Zillow says, Wara
added.)
</p>
<p>
Going forward, figuring out a property’s climate risk — much like
pushing for community-level resilience investment — shouldn’t be left up
to individuals, Condon said.
</p>
<p>
The state of California
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/california-to-explore-first-in-nation-public-wildfire-catastrophe-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
investing</u></a> in a public wildfire catastrophe model so that it can
figure out which homes and towns face the highest risk. She said that
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal entities that buy home
mortgages, could invest in their own internal climate-risk assessments
to build the public’s capacity to understand climate risk.
</p>
<p>
“I would advocate for this not to be an every-man-for-himself,
every-consumer-has-to-make-a-decision situation,” Condon said.

Trump campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris and former
President Donald Trump will take their fight for Pennsylvania to
opposite ends of the state on Monday, with Harris speaking in the
northwest corner in Erie and Trump in the southeastern suburbs of
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular
appearances in what is the country’s largest battleground state — it
will be Harris’ 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and
just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely
topics as they compete for the fraction of the state’s voters who have
not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state
where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential
race.</p>
<p>Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania
on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe
Biden beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.</p>
<p>Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of
about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant
numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s
reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly
moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.</p>
<p>Harris plans to talk up early voting during her rally. And she’ll
stop by a Black-owned small business in Erie in advance of the rally to
promote her proposals to give Black men more economic opportunities and
other chances to thrive as Democrats try to energize the voting
bloc.</p>
<p>Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo
Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout
among his supporters.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state,
have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and
Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events,
they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press
tracking of the campaigns’ public events.</p>
<p>Michigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next
most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on
winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue
wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.</p>
<p>Democrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both
current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s legislature is
closely divided.</p>

id="nasa-spacecraft-rockets-toward-jupiters-moon-europa-searching-for-keys-to-life">NASA
spacecraft rockets toward Jupiter’s moon Europa, searching for keys to
life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a
quest to explore Jupiter’s tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether
its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life.</p>
<p>It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it
will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to
Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys.</p>
<p>Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath
Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life,
making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for
it.</p>
<p>Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors.
Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to
sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it
peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions.</p>
<p>SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile)
journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from
Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated
from the upper stage, floated off and called home.</p>
<p>“Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,” NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory’s flight director Pranay Mishra announced from
Southern California.</p>
<p>“The science on this is really captivating,” NASA Associate
Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch
site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean,
“and here we are looking that far out.”</p>
<p>The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors.</p>
<p>NASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be
more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated.
Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays
during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months
reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission
could proceed as planned.</p>
<p>Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several
days.</p>
<p>“What a great day. We’re so excited,” JPL Director Laurie Leshin said
after liftoff.</p>
<p>About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled,
Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for
gravity assists. The nearly 5,700-kilogram (13,000-pound) probe should
reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030.</p>
<p>Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will
bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to
our own moon in size.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will skim as low as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above
Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will
attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 15 kilometers
to 24 kilometers (10 miles to 15 miles or more) thick. The ocean below
could be 120 kilometers (80 miles) or more deep.</p>
<p>The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics
stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection
against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034.</p>
<p>“Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be
habitable, but they might be habitable today,” NASA’s Gina DiBraccio
said on the eve of launch.</p>
<p>If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that
opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar
system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean
and geysers, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is another top candidate.</p>

Bigger in Texas, Including Hydrogen Emissions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Oil giants Exxon and Chevron are among a
<a href="https://www.hyvelocityhub.com/support/hyvelocity-selected-to-develop-gulf-coast-hydrogen-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>group
of energy companies</u></a> that could receive up to $1.2 billion in
federal grants to make so-called “clean” hydrogen in Texas. Their
proposal to produce the clean-burning fuel using natural gas and carbon
capture, in addition to other methods, was selected by the Biden
administration a year ago to become one of the country’s seven clean
hydrogen hubs. But a trio of researchers at the University of Texas at
Austin just showed that there’s a dirty paradox at the heart of the
plan.
</p>
<p>
In a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-024-01653-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
published in the journal <em><em>Nature Energy</em></em> on Monday, the
researchers show that upstream emissions in the natural gas supply chain
in Texas are so high that it’s essentially impossible to make hydrogen
from it that would meet federal standards for “clean” hydrogen. But, the
authors warn, the government’s proposed method for measuring the carbon
intensity of hydrogen overlooks these emissions. That means these Texas
hydrogen projects could get millions in public funding in the name of
tackling climate change, all while making the problem worse.
</p>
<p>
“You’re investing so much in developing a hydrogen economy, and then it
turns out, 10 years later, half of them are not even low carbon,” Arvind
Ravikumar, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin
and one of the authors of the new paper, told me. “I think that’s a real
risk.”
</p>
<p>
This story might sound familiar. I’ve written extensively about the
emissions accounting challenges plaguing another method for making clean
hydrogen that requires only water and carbon-free electricity, known as
electrolysis. The problem there is that the electric grid still runs
largely on fossil fuels, and so plugging in a hydrogen plant will
produce indirect emissions, even if the production process itself is
clean.
</p>
<p>
The new study highlights a similar issue with hydrogen made from natural
gas. Of course, since this method uses fossil fuels, it’s already
substantially more difficult to prove it has any climate benefits at
all. In theory, the emissions can be greatly reduced, although likely
not entirely eliminated, by capturing the carbon emitted from the plant.
The authors show, however, that the more important factor is where the
natural gas comes from.
</p>
<p>
Natural gas is mostly methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more
potent than carbon dioxide in the short term, and leaks are notoriously
underestimated. But any assessment of the benefits of hydrogen made from
methane must take leakage into account, and some natural gas fields are
leakier than others.
</p>
<p>
The paper analyzes a range of scenarios for two hypothetical hydrogen
plants — one on the Gulf Coast that sources natural gas from the Permian
Basin, and one in Ohio that gets gas from the Marcellus Shale. The
Treasury Department’s draft rules for calculating the carbon intensity
of hydrogen for the clean hydrogen tax credit say these two plants
should assume that a national average of 1% of the natural gas extracted
from the ground is leaked into the atmosphere where it warms the planet.
But more than a decade of on-the-ground measurements, combined with more
recent satellite data, has shown that methane leaks vary widely from
well to well and basin to basin.
</p>
<p>
Using the more accurate, though still approximate, leakage rates of 5.2%
in the Permian and 1.25% in the Marcellus, the authors calculated the
carbon intensity of hydrogen produced at the two plants under various
assumptions. What if the carbon capture system is more effective? Or
less effective? What if the capture equipment is powered by renewables?
What if we measure the warming effects of methane over 20 years versus
over 100 years?
</p>
<p>
No matter which variable they changed, one result stayed the same:
Hydrogen made from Permian Basin gas greatly exceeded the government’s
definition of clean hydrogen, i.e. 4 kilograms of CO2 released per
kilogram of hydrogen produced. In fact, the emissions from natural gas
production in the Permian Basin alone pushed it over that standard.
Hydrogen made from Marcellus Shale gas, on the other hand, has the
potential to qualify as clean if at least 90% of the carbon at the plant
is captured.
</p>
<p>
The findings suggest that without enormous efforts to reduce those
upstream emissions, which come from leaks, venting, and flaring at the
wellhead and along the pipeline system, natural gas-based hydrogen
projects on the Gulf Coast should not qualify for federal subsidies.
</p>
<p>
The authors advocate for the Treasury’s final guidelines for calculating
the carbon intensity of hydrogen to account for these regional
differences. “I think that, to begin with, will make a huge difference
in accurately estimating the emissions intensity of these projects,”
Ravikumar said. As new methane regulations from the Environmental
Protection Agency go into effect, it’s possible that projects that are
not eligible today could become eligible in the future. “But the point
is, you’ll only know that if you do your carbon accounting accurately
across supply chains,” he said.
</p>
<p>
One problem with this solution is that hydrogen producers have access to
another federal tax credit that doesn’t require any analysis of how
clean the hydrogen is — up to $85 for every ton of carbon they capture
and sequester underground. Indeed, at least one project developer has
<a href="https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/production/exclusive-we-will-not-claim-the-us-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-on-our-4-5bn-blue-h2-plant-in-louisiana-air-products/2-1-1646412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
said they will go after that subsidy</u></a> instead of the one for
clean hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Ravikumar thinks those developers are facing a major risk. “At the end
of the day, you’re going to buy hydrogen from these companies explicitly
for its low-carbon attributes,” he said. “Right now we did this
analysis, but very soon, you’re going to have satellites that are going
to look at all these regions and be able to make emissions information
publicly available. And once you’re able to do that, you can’t make up
numbers on paper.”

Jersey Shore amusement park closes after generations of family
thrills</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OCEAN CITY, N.J. — For generations of vacationers heading to Ocean
City, the towering “Giant Wheel” was the first thing they saw from miles
away.</p>
<p>The sight of the 140-foot-tall (42-meter) ride let them know they
were getting close to the Jersey Shore town that calls itself “America’s
Greatest Family Resort,” with its promise of kid-friendly beaches,
seagulls and sea shells, and a bustling boardwalk full of pizza, ice
cream and cotton candy.</p>
<p>And in the heart of it was Gillian’s Wonderland Pier, an amusement
park that was the latest in nearly a century-long line of
family-friendly amusement attractions operated by the family of Ocean
City’s mayor.</p>
<p>But the rides were to fall silent and still Sunday night, as the park
run by Ocean City’s mayor and nurtured by generations of his ancestors,
closed down, the victim of financial woes made worse by the lingering
aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p>Gillian and his family have operated amusement rides and attractions
on the Ocean City Boardwalk for 94 years. The latest iteration of the
park, Wonderland, opened in 1965.</p>
<p>“I tried my best to sustain Wonderland for as long as possible,
through increasingly difficult challenges each year,” Mayor Jay Gillian
wrote in August when he announced the park would close. “It’s been my
life, my legacy and my family. But it’s no longer a viable
business.”</p>
<p>Gillian did not respond to numerous requests for comment over the
past week.</p>
<p>Sheryl Gross was at the park for its final day with her two children
and five grandchildren, enjoying it one last time.</p>
<p>“I’ve been coming here forever,” she said. “My daughter is 43 and
I’ve been coming here since she was 2 years old in a stroller. Now I’m
here with my grandchildren.”</p>
<p>She remembers decades of bringing her family from Gloucester Township
in the southern New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia to create happy
family memories at Wonderland.</p>
<p>“Just the excitement on their faces when they get on the rides,” she
said. “It really made it feel family-friendly. A lot of that is going to
be lost now.”</p>
<p>There were long lines Sunday for the Giant Wheel, the log flume and
other popular rides as people used the last of ride tickets many had
bought earlier in the year, thinking Wonderland would go on forever.</p>
<p>A local non-profit group, Friends of OCNJ History and Culture, is
raising money to try and save the amusement park, possibly under a new
owner who might be more amenable to buying it with some financial
assistance. Bill Merritt, one of the non-profit’s leaders, said the
group has raised over $1 million to help meet what could be a
$20-million price tag for the property.</p>
<p>“Ocean City will be fundamentally different without this attraction,”
he said. “This town relies on being family-friendly. The park has rides
targeted at kids; it’s called ‘Wonderland’ for a reason.”</p>
<p>The property’s current owner, Icona Resorts, previously proposed a
$150-million, 325-room luxury hotel elsewhere on Ocean City’s boardwalk,
but the city rejected those plans.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO, Eustace Mita, said earlier this year he would take
at least until the end of the year to propose a use for the amusement
park property.</p>
<p>He bought it in 2021 after Gillian’s family was in danger of
defaulting on bank loans for the property.</p>
<p>At a community meeting last month, Gillian said Wonderland could not
bounce back from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the pandemic in 2020 and an
increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage that doubled his payroll costs,
leaving him $4 million in debt.</p>
<p>Mita put up funds to stave off a sheriff’s sale of the property, and
gave the mayor three years to turn the business around. That deadline
expired this year.</p>
<p>Mita did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Merritt said he and others can’t imagine Ocean City without
Wonderland.</p>
<p>“You look at it with your heart, and you say ‘You’re losing all the
cherished memories and all the history; how can you let that go?’” he
said. “And then you look at it with your head and you say, ‘They are the
reason this town is profitable; how can you let that go?’”</p>

Seen Taylor Krause on ‘Love Is Blind.’ Now Read Her Policy Paper.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMzQ5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzE2MzUyNX0.SyIVuFIFFT1rBzM-MPuN1wuPTVo_SCqSQANZiIY22A4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Millions of Americans first met Washington, D.C., resident Taylor Krause
when she appeared on Netflix’s dating show “Love Is Blind.” The series
frames getting engaged as a type of matching problem, where contestants
talk to each other, fall in love, and get engaged before they meet each
other in person.
</p>
<p>
But here at Heatmap, we know Krause’s work because of a different type
of matching problem: How to match clean hydrogen makers with new sources
of clean electricity?
</p>
<p>
Krause works on the problem of decarbonizing heavy industry for the
climate policy think tank RMI. Her team is wrapped up in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>a
sprawling fight</u></a> over how to regulate the clean hydrogen
industry, a fight Heatmap followed keenly. The battle could determine
how the government spends up to an estimated $100 billion in tax credits
to incentivize the production of green hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Treasury recently told Heatmap those regulations will be finalized by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>the
end of the year</u></a>. Meanwhile, the newest salvo in that fight —
this being D.C., it took the form of a policy memo — was released on
Monday by RMI.
<a href="https://rmi.org/a-roadmap-for-designing-hydrogen-projects-for-45v-compliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
white paper</u></a>, coauthored by Krause, explains how developers could
actually build clean hydrogen projects that are connected to the power
grid while meeting the government’s stringent proposed standards.
</p>
<p>
It emerged in part from RMI’s collaboration with a “working group
spanning developers, registries, and electricity forecasting experts,”
according to the paper, and it proposes a series of ways hydrogen
developers can meet the stringent
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>three
pillars</u></a>” standards the government has proposed. These rules
would require that any electricity used to electrolyze water and extract
hydrogen itself be produced by new zero-carbon sources during the same
time period it’s used, and on the same power grid as the electrolyzer.
</p>
<p>
This three-step approach aims to keep the generous hydrogen tax credit
from creating higher electricity prices across the power grid and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20developed%20a%20structure%20that%20will%20drive%20innovation%20and%20create%20good%2Dpaying%20jobs%20in%20this%20emerging%20industry%20while%20strengthening%20our%20energy%20security%20and%20reducing%20emissions%20in%20hard%2Dto%2Dtransition%20sectors%20of%20the%20economy%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said." target="_self"><u>generating
more emissions</u></a> than the hydrogen produced will mitigate, but it
has been criticized by some companies for being too arduous and
complicated to comply with. (Some hydrogen makers, such as the
industrial gas-making giant Air Products,
<a href="https://www.airproducts.com/energy-transition/air-products-response-to-45v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support</u></a>
the three pillars approach.)
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest topics the new memo tackles is the problem of buying
clean electricity. If America regulates the clean hydrogen industry as
the Biden administration has proposed, then eventually hydrogen
companies will need to buy electricity credits from a “registry” — a
company that can guarantee the power the hydrogen companies bought
actually complies with the rules.
</p>
<p>
Those registries don’t exist right now. Until they do, the new memo
argues, hydrogen makers should go straight to the source and solve the
“matching problem” by contracting directly with a newly built solar,
wind, or zero-carbon power source, using a two-way deal like a power
purchase agreement,
<a href="https://rmi.org/people/nathan-iyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nathan
Iyer</u></a>, a senior associate at RMI and co-author of the paper, told
me. (Krause didn’t have time to talk.)
</p>
<p>
In other words: If you’re a clean hydrogen maker trying to buy
electricity to power your electrolyzer, then love — or at least your
procurement budget — should <em><em>not </em></em>be blind. Good to
know. The memo ticks through a few other myths about the new standards
that Krause and Iyer want to debunk. It’s a good reminder that while
there might be no rules in love and war, there are
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28359/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen#h-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 100 pages of proposed rules</u></a> for taking advantage of the
Inflation Reduction Act’s clean hydrogen production tax credit.

id="nobel-economics-prize-awarded-for-research-into-why-countries-succeed-or-fail">Nobel
economics prize awarded for research into why countries succeed or
fail</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday
to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into
differences in prosperity between nations and why some countries succeed
and others fail.</p>
<p>The three economists “have demonstrated the importance of societal
institutions for a country’s prosperity,” the Nobel committee of the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the announcement in
Stockholm.</p>
<p>“Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the
population do not generate growth or change for the better. The
laureates’ research helps us understand why,” it added.</p>
<p>Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Robinson conducts his research at the University of
Chicago.</p>
<p>“Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of
our time’s greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the
importance of societal institutions for achieving this,” Jakob Svensson,
Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said.</p>
<p>He said their research has provided “a much deeper understanding of
the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.”</p>
<p>Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, where he is due to speak at
a conference, Acemoglu said he was surprised and shocked by the
award.</p>
<p>“You never expect something like this,” he said.</p>
<p>The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in
Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank
established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish
businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five
Nobel Prizes.</p>
<p>Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically
not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.</p>
<p>Nobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics,
chemistry, literature and peace.</p>

Bank says 26 poorest countries in worst financial shape since 2006</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The world’s 26 poorest countries, home to 40% of the
most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since
2006 and increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and other shocks,
a new World Bank report showed on Sunday.</p>
<p>The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average
than they were on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the rest of
the world has largely recovered from COVID and resumed its growth
trajectory.</p>
<p>Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund
annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major
setback to efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and underscores the
World Bank’s efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its
financing fund for the world’s poorest countries, the International
Development Association (IDA).</p>
<p>The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita
incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and
near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up,
the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an
18-year high and half of the group are either in debt distress or at
high risk of it.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts
or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social
fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export
commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report
said.</p>
<p>“At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest
countries, IDA has been their lifeline,” World Bank chief economist
Indermit Gill said in a statement. “Over the past five years, it has
poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies,
keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.”</p>
<p>IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from
World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in
2021, and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with
over $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Natural disasters also have taken a greater toll on these countries
over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were
associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the
average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing up the need for
much higher investment, the World Bank said.</p>
<p>The report also recommended that these economies, which have large
informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help
themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying
taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the
efficiency of public spending.</p>

condemns ‘illegal, unjustified’ US sanctions on oil industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tehran, Iran — Iran condemned Sunday what it called an “illegal and
unjustified” expansion of U.S. sanctions targeting its oil industry
following Tehran’s missile attack on Israel earlier this month.  </p>
<p>In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei defended
Iran’s attack on Israel and “strongly condemned” the sanctions, saying
they were “illegal and unjustified.”  </p>
<p>The United States on Friday slapped Iran with a spate of new
sanctions on the country’s oil and petrochemical industry in response to
Tehran’s October 1 attack against Israel.</p>
<p>Baghaei defended Iran’s attack on Israel as being legal and insisted
on Iran’s right to respond to the new sanctions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said it targeted Iran’s so-called shadow
fleet of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of
existing sanctions.</p>
<p>It said it had designated at least 10 companies and 17 vessels as
“blocked property” over their involvement in shipments of Iranian
petroleum and petrochemical products.  </p>
<p>The State Department also announced it was placing sanctions on six
further firms and six ships for “knowingly engaging in a significant
transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing
of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran”.</p>
<p>Baghaei said “the policy of threats and maximum pressure” had no
impact on “Iran’s will to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity,
national interests and citizens against any violation and foreign
aggressions.”</p>
<p>He said the sanctions would enable Israel “to continue killing
innocents and pose a threat to the peace and unity of the region and the
world”.</p>
<p>The new wave of sanctions comes as the world awaits Israel’s promised
response to Tehran’s missile attack, with oil prices hitting their
highest levels since August.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden advised Israel against
targeting oil infrastructure in Iran, one of the world’s 10 largest
producers.</p>
<p>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi last Tuesday warned that “any
attack against infrastructure in Iran will provoke an even stronger
response.”</p>

Hurricane Milton damage in Florida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ST. PETE BEACH, Fla. — U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday surveyed
the devastating damage in Florida left in the aftermath of Hurricane
Milton sweeping across the state last week, where residents are still
recovering from the destruction wrought by late September’s Hurricane
Helene. </p>
<p>“This area is taking a real beating from back-to-back storms,” Biden
said after his Marine One helicopter flew over Florida’s western coast
from Tampa to St. Petersburg. The flight offered him a close look at the
battered region, including the shredded roof of the Tampa Bay Rays’
baseball stadium, Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. </p>
<p>Seventeen people were killed across the state during the storm, many
from tornadoes spawned by the hurricane. </p>
<p>On the ground, Biden saw entire neighborhoods in St. Pete Beach with
debris piled on street corners next to felled palm trees. Many of the
pastel-painted garage doors were busted open as the smell of moldy
building materials filled the air. </p>
<p>Heaps of mattresses, siding, couches, microwave ovens, pillows and
ruined kitchen cabinets all lined the island’s roads, some still covered
in large patches of sand, as Biden walked through with emergency
responders. One photo album still lay scattered in the street. </p>
<p>“Help,” one resident asked Biden in lettering on one pile of
household debris.  </p>
<p>Biden praised the region’s residents for helping each other recover.
“That’s the resilience of west Florida,” he said, noting that even with
the contentious Nov. 5 presidential election in the immediate offing,
people were pitching in to restore their community, “not as Democrats
and Republicans, but as Americans, Americans who need help.” </p>
<p>He said power had been restored to 2 million of the estimated 3
million people who lost electricity during the wrath of Milton as it
swept eastward from the state’s western shoreline along the Gulf of
Mexico across the state before moving into the Atlantic Ocean. Biden
said thousands of electrical workers from 43 states and Canada had gone
to Florida to help repair its grid. </p>
<p>Biden announced $612 million in new federal aid for the victims of
the two hurricanes across the southeastern U.S. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said flooding is expected to continue
around Tampa Bay and the Sanford area northeast of Orlando as river
waters continue to rise. </p>
<p>More fuel distribution sites were scheduled to open Sunday, according
to the state’s emergency operations center.     </p>
<p>Sarasota Mayor Liz Alpert said recovery was expected to take a long

Europa Clipper spacecraft will scour Jupiter moon for ingredients for
life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A NASA spacecraft is ready to set sail for
Jupiter and its moon Europa, one of the best bets for finding life
beyond Earth.</p>
<p>Europa Clipper will peer beneath the moon’s icy crust where an ocean
is thought to be sloshing fairly close to the surface. It won’t search
for life, but rather determine whether conditions there could support
it. Another mission would be needed to flush out any microorganisms
lurking there.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been
habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable
today — right now,” said program scientist Curt Niebur.</p>
<p>Its massive solar panels make Clipper the biggest craft built by NASA
to investigate another planet. It will take 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter
and will sneak within 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Europa’s surface —
considerably closer than any other spacecraft.</p>
<p>Liftoff is targeted for this month aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy
rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Mission cost: $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Europa, the superstar among Jupiter’s many moons</p>
<p>One of Jupiter’s 95 known moons, Europa is almost the size of our own
moon. It’s encased in an ice sheet estimated to be 10 miles to 15 miles
or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. Scientists believe this
frozen crust hides an ocean that could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or
more deep. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what appear to be
geysers erupting from the surface. Discovered by Galileo in 1610, Europa
is one of the four so-called Galilean moons of Jupiter, along with
Ganymede, Io and Callisto.</p>
<p>Seeking conditions that support life</p>
<p>What type of life might Europa harbor? Besides water, organic
compounds are needed for life as we know it, plus an energy source. In
Europa’s case that could be thermal vents on the ocean floor. Deputy
project scientist Bonnie Buratti imagines any life would be primitive
like the bacterial life that originated in Earth’s deep ocean vents. “We
will not know from this mission because we can’t see that deep,” she
said. Unlike missions to Mars where habitability is one of many
questions, Clipper’s sole job is to establish whether the moon could
support life in its ocean or possibly in any pockets of water in the
ice.</p>
<p>Supersized spacecraft</p>
<p>When its solar wings and antennas are unfurled, Clipper is about the
size of a basketball court — more than 100 feet (30 meters) end to end —
and weighs nearly 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). The supersized solar
panels are needed because of Jupiter’s distance from the sun. The main
body — about the size of a camper — is packed with nine science
instruments, including radar that will penetrate the ice, cameras that
will map virtually the entire moon and tools to tease out the contents
of Europa’s surface and tenuous atmosphere. The name hearkens to the
swift sailing ships of centuries past.</p>
<p>Circling Jupiter to fly by Europa</p>
<p>The roundabout trip to Jupiter will span 1.8 billion miles (3 billion
kilometers). For extra oomph, the spacecraft will swing past Mars early
next year and then Earth in late 2026. It arrives at Jupiter in 2030 and
begins science work the next year. While orbiting Jupiter, it will cross
paths with Europa 49 times. The mission ends in 2034 with a planned
crash into Ganymede — Jupiter’s biggest moon and the solar system’s
too.</p>
<p>Europa flybys pose huge radiation risk</p>
<p>There’s more radiation around Jupiter than anywhere else in our solar
system, besides the sun. Europa passes through Jupiter’s bands of
radiation as it orbits the gas giant, making it especially menacing for
spacecraft. That’s why Clipper’s electronics are inside a vault with
dense aluminum and zinc walls. All this radiation would nix any life on
Europa’s surface. But it could break down water molecules and, perhaps,
release oxygen all the way down into the ocean that could possibly fuel
sea life.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NASA was in a panic that the spacecraft’s many
transistors might not withstand the intense radiation. But after months
of analysis, engineers concluded the mission could proceed as
planned.</p>
<p>Other visitors to Jupiter and Europa</p>
<p>NASA’s twin Pioneer spacecraft and then two Voyagers swept past
Jupiter in the 1970s. The Voyagers provided the first detailed photos of
Europa but from quite a distance. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had repeated
flybys of the moon during the 1990s, passing as close as 124 miles (200
kilometers). Still in action around Jupiter, NASA’s Juno spacecraft has
added to Europa’s photo album. Arriving at Jupiter a year after Clipper
will be the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, launched last
year.</p>
<p>Ganymede and other possible ocean worlds</p>
<p>Like Europa, Jupiter’s jumbo moon Ganymede is thought to host an
underground ocean. But its frozen shell is much thicker — possibly 100
miles (160 kilometers) thick — making it tougher to probe the
environment below. Callisto’s ice sheet may be even thicker, possibly
hiding an ocean. Saturn’s moon Enceladus has geysers shooting up, but
it’s much farther than Jupiter. Ditto for Saturn’s moon Titan, also
suspected of having a subterranean sea. While no ocean worlds have been
confirmed beyond our solar system, scientists believe they’re out there
— and may even be relatively common.</p>
<p>Messages in a cosmic bottle</p>
<p>Like many robotic explorers before it, Clipper bears messages from
Earth. Attached to the electronics vault is a triangular metal plate. On
one side is a design labeled “water words” with representations of the
word for water in 104 languages. On the opposite side: a poem about the
moon by U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon and a silicon chip containing the
names of 2.6 million people who signed up to vicariously ride along.</p>
