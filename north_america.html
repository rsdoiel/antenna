Plenty of companies use BLS data to make business decisions. With questions raised about the quality and regularity of that data now, how do alternate data sources compare?

      <p>
      <p>Recently, President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after revisions depicted a weaker job market than initially thought. This week, Trump called on the CEO of Goldman Sachs to get rid of his chief economist, after the economist predicted that tariffs would force consumers to pay extra. What should consumers and investors make of this? We'll discuss. And later, we'll hear how French factories are benefiting from increased defense spending.</p>

      <p>Social Security turns 90 tomorrow. Some 74 million Americans receive the benefits, and a new survey shows that 65% of retirees rely on them. Roughly 40% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and this precarity comes at a time when Social Security faces the possibility of benefit cuts. Plus, Trump's tariffs are generating billions in revenue monthly, and Brazil's president announced $5 billion to help smaller companies deal with tariffs.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It came right down to the wire, but the U.S. and China have extended their trade truce until November. This means those massive American tariff hikes — some as high as 145% — have been put on hold, as Beijing was ready to hit back with 125% tariffs. But could another 90 days be enough time to strike a deal? Plus, this summer, several U.S. cities have been gripped by trash collection strikes. We'll hear more.</p>

      <p>If President Donald Trump’s tariffs stymie the U.S. economy — which would, in turn, slow the global economy — oil demand will fall. And we're already operating at a surplus. In this episode, why the oil market tea leaves are difficult to read right now. Plus: Trump takes an “unprecedented” hands-on approach to Big Tech business dealings, and tariffs on semiconductors will make electronics more expensive. And, despite a six-year period of steep overall inflation, some prices have dropped. Can you guess which ones?</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

      <p>The U.S. and India, until about a week ago when steep tariffs went into effect, had been on track to forge strong ties in trade, defense, and other areas. One thing that seems to have been lost in the tariff drama was the budding “bromance” between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Also: a look at how the so-called “meme stock” effect has affected companies that have been boosted, and we talk with economist Julia Coronado about the possibility of a Fed rate cut in upcoming cycles. </p>
