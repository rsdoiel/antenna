Donald Trump administration officials disbanded two expert committees on

administration has hinted at fiddling with important numbers, and a
listener wrote in to ask how all this might impact businesses and the
market. We’ll break it down. Plus, why is nobody talking about the debt
limit? And, congrats to Bill in Ohio on scoring a hat trick!

On today’s episode, we’re discussing a pair of recent rulings about the
Trump administration’s efforts to cut foreign aid and fire federal
workers, leaving us with a “Through the Looking-Glass” moment, where the

in the midst of uncertain economic times. And, we’ll smile at a math
problem solved through the power of anime fans.

<p>
The National Women’s Soccer League’s regular season kicks off next week.
And thanks in part to a record-breaking
<a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media
rights agreement</a> and the growth of women’s professional sports
across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment
— than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women’s
sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired
a controlling stake in the franchise for
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250
million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team’s CEO and co-founder, says Angel
City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she
and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day
experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City’s growth, and
how to watch the NWSL’s season.

yield on the 10-year Treasury note (the benchmark for mortgages and car
loans) is down sharply, which is great for consumers. But it’s happening

keeping a close eye on one of her go-to government websites. And, she’ll
share tales from her trip to Venice’s famed carnival.
