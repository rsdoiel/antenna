id="chinese-hackers-breach-parts-of-us-telecom-system-target-trump-harris-campaigns">Chinese
hackers breach parts of US telecom system, target Trump, Harris
campaigns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Hackers linked to the Chinese government have broken
into parts of the U.S. telecommunications system in a breach that might
be connected to an attempt to access data from the presidential
campaigns of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee
Kamala Harris.  </p>
<p>The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency late
Friday said they were investigating “unauthorized access” to commercial
telecommunications infrastructure, attributing the attack to
Chinese-affiliated actors.</p>
<p>The agencies said they immediately notified affected companies once
the breach was detected and had offered assistance, though there might
be additional victims.</p>
<p>“The investigation is ongoing, and we encourage any organization that
believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or
CISA,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Agencies across the U.S. government are collaborating to
aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry
partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial
communications sector,” it added.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington dismissed the U.S. hacking
allegations as disinformation, calling the U.S. “the origin and the
biggest perpetrator of cyberattacks.”</p>
<p>“For some time, the U.S. has compiled and spread all kinds of
disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats,” said
embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu in an email to VOA.</p>
<p>“China’s position is consistent and clear,” he said. “China firmly
opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms.”</p>
<p>Word of the breach linked to China followed a report by The New York
Times on Friday that Chinese hackers are thought to have broken into
telecommunications networks to target the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>People familiar with the investigation told the Times that the
Chinese hackers specifically looked to access data from phones used by
Trump and his running mate, Republican Senator JD Vance.</p>
<p>Separately, a person familiar with the investigation told VOA that
people affiliated with the campaign of Vice President Harris were also
targeted. </p>
<p>Investigators are still trying to determine what data the hackers
were able to get, if any, and whether the hackers could listen in on
conversations in real time.  </p>
<p>The FBI declined to comment on the Trump and Harris campaign
breaches.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with VOA, the Trump campaign acknowledged the
breach and blamed Harris for letting it happen.</p>
<p>“This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris
and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and
Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President
Trump from returning to the White House,” said Steven Cheung, the Trump
campaign communications director.</p>
<p>“Their dangerous and violent rhetoric has given permission to those
who wish to harm President Trump,” Cheung added.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to questions asking for more
details on how Harris or her campaign enabled the Chinese hack.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign has yet to respond to VOA’s request for
comment.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have warned for months that foreign
adversaries have been using a combination of cyberattacks and influence
operations to meddle with the November 5 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>According to a declassified intelligence assessment issued this week,
“foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent on
fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’
confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they
perceive to be in their interests.”</p>
<p>It further warned that Russia and Iran were formulating plans to
spark election-related violence.</p>
<p>In addition, reports issued this week by private cybersecurity firms
likewise indicated a significant uptick in activity by actors linked to
Russia, China and Iran.</p>
<p>All three nations have repeatedly denied accusations of election
meddling.</p>
<p>And while U.S. intelligence officials assess there is little
agreement among the three countries on the desired outcomes of the
presidential election — Russia is said to want a Trump win, Iran is said
to be rooting for Harris, and China sees both as equally bad — the Trump
campaign has become a frequent target of attacks.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. Justice Department charged three Iranian hackers
tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in connection with a
hack-and-leak operation seeking to undermine Trump’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials have also accused Iran of trying to
ensnare the campaign of current U.S. President Joe Biden before he
stepped down in favor of Harris.</p>
<p>But U.S. security officials have been even more leery of China.</p>
<p>U.S. agencies, led by CISA and the FBI, have been warning that
China-linked hackers have burrowed into U.S. computer systems and
networks, in some case hiding for years.</p>
<p>The China-linked group, known as Volt Typhoon, has been “positioning
itself to launch destructive cyberattacks that would jeopardize the
physical safety of Americans,” according to an advisory issued in
February.</p>
<p>“What we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” CISA
Director Jen Easterly said in a statement at the time.</p>

id="heres-a-look-at-musks-contact-with-putin-and-why-it-matters">Here’s
a look at Musk’s contact with Putin and why it matters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of major government
contractor SpaceX and a key ally of Republican presidential nominee
Donald Trump, has been in regular contact with Russian President
Vladimir Putin for the last two years, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, confirmed to The Associated
Press that Musk and Putin have had contact through calls. The person
didn’t provide additional details about the frequency of the calls, when
they occurred or their content.</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person who also owns Tesla and the social
media platform X, has emerged as a leading voice on the American right.
He’s poured millions of dollars into Trump’s presidential bid and turned
the platform once known as Twitter into a site popular with Trump
supporters, as well as conspiracy theorists, extremists and Russian
propagandists.</p>
<p>Musk’s contacts with Putin raise national security questions, given
his companies’ work for the government, and highlight concerns about
Russian influence in American politics.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>What they talked about</p>
<p>Musk and Putin have spoken repeatedly about personal matters,
business and geopolitics, The Journal reported Thursday, citing multiple
current and former officials in the United States, Europe and
Russia.</p>
<p>During one talk, Putin asked Musk not to activate his Starlink
satellite system over Taiwan as a favor for Chinese President Xi
Jinping, whose ties to Putin have grown closer, The Journal reported.
Putin and Xi have met more than 40 times since 2013. </p>
<p>Russia has denied the conversations took place. In 2022, Musk said
he’d spoken to Putin only once, in a call 18 months earlier focused on
space.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington said Friday that it was “not aware
of the specifics” of any requests made by Putin on China’s behalf.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response to messages left with X and Tesla
seeking Musk’s comment.</p>
<p>What the talks mean for national security</p>
<p>Musk’s relationship with Putin raises national security questions
given the billions of dollars in government contracts awarded to SpaceX,
a critical partner to NASA and government satellite programs.</p>
<p>Trump also has vowed to give Musk a role in his administration if he
wins next month.</p>
<p>The head of any large defense contractor would face similar questions
if they held private talks with one of America’s greatest adversaries,
said Bradley Bowman, a former West Point assistant professor and Senate
national security adviser who now serves as senior director of the
Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, a Washington-based defense think tank.</p>
<p>Bowman said the timing of the calls as reported by The Journal and
Musk’s changing views on Ukraine was a “disturbing coincidence.”</p>
<p>“The policy of the U.S. government is to try to isolate Vladimir
Putin, and Elon Musk is directly undercutting that,” Bowman said. “What
is Putin doing with Musk? Putin is trying to reduce his international
isolation and impact American foreign policy.”</p>
<p>The request from Putin on Starlink as a favor to China is also likely
to get attention, given U.S. support for Taiwan and concerns about the
growing partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing.</p>
<p>Musk, whose Tesla operates Gigafactory Shanghai, has developed a
close relationship with China’s top leaders. His remarks about China
have been friendly, and he has suggested Taiwan cede some control to
Beijing by becoming a special administrative region.</p>
<p>Moscow has growing ties to other American adversaries. The U.S. has
accused Russia of sending ballistic missiles to Iran and said North
Korea sent troops to Russia, possibly for combat in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On Ukraine, Musk’s views have shifted since he initially supported
Kyiv following Russia’s invasion in 2022 and provided it with his
Starlink system for communications.</p>
<p>Musk then refused to allow Ukraine in 2023 to use Starlink for a
surprise attack on Russian soldiers in Crimea.</p>
<p>He also floated a proposal to end the war that would have required
Ukraine to drop its plans for NATO membership and given Russia permanent
control of Crimea, which it seized in 2014. The plan infuriated
Ukrainian leaders.</p>
<p>One person familiar with the talks between Musk and Putin told The
Journal that there is no evidence the contact between Musk and Putin
represents a security problem for the U.S.</p>
<p>Asked about Musk’s contacts with Putin, White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday that he had no information
to share.</p>
<p>The CIA, Pentagon and National Security Agency had no comment. The
State Department didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking
comment.</p>
<p>Musk’s close ties to Trump</p>
<p>Musk recently appeared at a Trump rally, sporting a Make America
Great Again hat and delivered an ominous warning that if Trump lost the
race, “this will be the last election.”</p>
<p>Last year, Musk mocked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
request for aid for his country with a meme and said in February that
the U.S. should cut its assistance because Ukraine couldn’t win.</p>
<p>Trump, who has praised Putin’s leadership and criticized the NATO
alliance and U.S. aid for Ukraine, has raised questions about what he
would be willing to concede if he’s elected in a negotiation over
Ukraine’s future.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials and private tech analysts have concluded
that Russia is working to covertly support Trump with disinformation and
propaganda targeting his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala
Harris. Since he took over X, it has become a leading online source of
Russian propaganda and disinformation aimed at Americans.</p>
<p>Trump has faced scrutiny over his own recent contacts with Putin,
outlined in a new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward.</p>
<p>Woodward quoted an unnamed Trump aide who said the former president
and Putin may have had as many as seven conversations since Trump lost
reelection in 2020.</p>
<p>Before one of the calls, the aide said they were asked to leave
Trump’s office to give the two privacy.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign and the Kremlin have denied those calls
occurred.</p>
<p>In response to questions about Musk and Putin, Trump campaign press
secretary Karoline Leavitt called the billionaire “a
once-in-a-generation industry leader” whose ideas could benefit “our
broken federal bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>“As for Putin, there’s only one candidate in the race that he did not
invade another country under, and it’s President Trump,” Leavitt said in
a statement. “President Trump has long said that he will re-establish
his peace through strength foreign policy to deter Russia’s aggression
and end the war in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Russia confirms one conversation</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday rejected The Journal’s
report as “absolutely false information.”</p>
<p>Peskov said Putin and Musk once held a “medium-length phone
conversation” prior to 2022 that was “as more of an introductory nature”
and that the two talked about “visionary technologies, technological
solutions for the future.”</p>
<p>“After that, Musk had no contacts with Putin,” Peskov said,
dismissing The Journal’s article as political.</p>
<p>“The election has entered its home stretch, and of course the
opponents stop at nothing,” Peskov said. “Remember that a week ago they
were saying that Putin allegedly talks to Trump all day long. Now he
allegedly talks to Musk all the time. It’s all untrue.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military intelligence told the AP that they would “refrain
from commenting” about communication between Putin and Musk.</p>

id="biden-apologizes-for-school-policy-that-separated-native-american-families">Biden
apologizes for school policy that separated Native American
families</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAVEEN VILLAGE, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Friday formally
apologized to Native Americans for the government-run boarding school
system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents,
calling it a “blot on American history” in his first presidential visit
to Indian Country. </p>
<p>“It’s a sin on our soul,” said Biden, his voice full of anger and
emotion. “Quite frankly, there’s no excuse that this apology took 50
years to make.” </p>
<p>It was a moment of both contrition and frustration as the president
sought to recognize one of the “most horrific chapters” in the national
story. Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that
resulted from the federal government’s policies, noting that “while
darkness can hide much, it erases nothing” and that great nations “must
know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.” </p>
<p>“I formally apologize as president of United States of America for
what we did,” Biden said. “The federal Indian boarding school policy,
the pain it has caused, will only be a significant mark of shame, a blot
on our record history. For too long, this all happened with virtually no
public attention, not written about in our history books, not taught in
our schools.” </p>
<p>Boost for Harris</p>
<p>Democrats hope Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s
land on the outskirts of Phoenix’s metro area will also provide a boost
to Vice President Kamala Harris’ turnout effort in a key battleground
state. The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and
Harris’ support for tribal nations, a group that historically has
favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020. </p>
<p>The race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected
to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to
improve turnout among bedrock supporters. </p>
<p>“The race is now a turnout grab,” said Mike O’Neil, a nonpartisan
pollster in Arizona. “The trend lines throughout have been remarkably
steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out
their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow
margins.” </p>
<p>Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and
other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July. </p>
<p>But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native
American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates. </p>
<p>In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in
Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential
candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996. </p>
<p>Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders
nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country. </p>
<p>For decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate
children into white society, according to the White House. Not everyone
saw the apology as sufficient. </p>
<p>“An apology is a nice start, but it is not a true reckoning, nor is
it a sufficient remedy for the long history of colonial violence,” said
Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People’s Law Project and Sacred
Defense Fund. </p>
<p>973 deaths</p>
<p>At least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government’s
abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in
1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for
a U.S. government apology. </p>
<p>At least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their
parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate
them. </p>
<p>“President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the
issue and other issues impacting the community,” said Ramona Charette
Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. “I do think that will reflect well on
Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.” </p>
<p>Both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, met
with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who
has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North
Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. </p>
<p>The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track
record with Native Americans over the last four years. </p>
<p>The president designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in
Nevada, and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand
Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for
Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. </p>
<p>In addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in
federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring
electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access
to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and
more. </p>
<p>Biden picked former New Mexico Representative Deb Haaland to serve as
his interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a
Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New
Mexico. </p>
<p>She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the
troubled legacy of the federal government’s boarding school policies
that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.</p>

id="exclusive-new-yorks-32-million-induction-stove-contest-has-a-winner">Exclusive:
New York’s $32 Million Induction Stove Contest Has a Winner</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg3MTA0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDk2MzQ3Nn0.kqbp7XtbWzbcO3E5QPCqZrJTPK-0KHlNt6mm34Gr4KU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Last year, New York City went shopping for 10,000 induction stoves so it
could ditch gas in its public housing. Now it’s ready to make a
purchase.
</p>
<p>
The New York Power Authority and NYC Housing Authority have selected
<a href="https://copperhome.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Copper</u></a>,
a Berkeley, California-based startup that was formerly known as Channing
Street Copper Company, as the winner of their Induction Stove Challenge,
Heatmap has learned. The agencies are planning to award the company a
$32 million, seven-year contract to design, prototype, test, and install
its stoves in apartments throughout the city.
</p>
<p>
As I wrote when I covered the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/induction-stoves-new-york-city-public-housing-authority" target="_self"><u>launch
of the contest</u></a> in 2023, the goal is not just to improve the
lives of NYC public housing residents by helping them avoid the toxic
fumes of cooking with gas, but also to spur a larger market
transformation that lowers the barriers to induction stoves for
everyone.
</p>
<p>
These aren’t just any induction stoves. Manufacturers were challenged to
design an appliance that’s compatible with a standard 120-volt outlet so
that it doesn’t require an expensive electrical upgrade to install. Most
products on the market require a 240-volt outlet.
</p>
<p>
The news of the winner was buried in the
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/notices-and-agendas/2024/finance-committee-meetingagenda-completejuly-16-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>minutes
of a NYPA Finance Committee meeting</u></a> that took place in July,
when Authority staff submitted a request to the committee to recommend
that its Board of Trustees approve the award. The Trustees approved the
award at a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHB1oJ8sF3o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>meeting
on July 30</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s unclear whether the contest ultimately fostered much innovation.
The meeting minutes say that only four companies submitted proposals.
I’m aware of at least two startups — Copper and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/impulse-labs-cooktop-sam-damico-induction-stove" target="_self"><u>Impulse
Labs</u></a> — that were already designing induction stoves for 120-volt
outlets prior to NYPA’s challenge. Both companies solve the issue with a
similar solution — their stoves come with built-in batteries that can
supply extra voltage as needed.
</p>
<p>
In response to a question about why NYPA selected Copper, a spokesperson
pointed to the fact that the company has already designed, developed,
and manufactured stoves with similar specifications to what the contest
was calling for. “From the competitively procured proposal and
interview, the company demonstrated their deep understanding of both
residential electrical systems as well as battery equipped products,”
they told me.
</p>
<p>
Still, the award has the potential to make this technology more
accessible by bringing down the cost through economies of scale.
Currently, Copper’s least expensive stove sells for $5,999; NYPA said
the stove delivered for the program is expected to be below $3,000, but
NYCHA is still negotiating the cost and other aspects of the product
before fully awarding the contract. (Copper was not able to respond to
questions about the award as it has not been officially announced yet.)
</p>
<p>
That price also doesn’t take into account the avoided cost of redoing
the electrical work in the buildings. Ultimately the order could also be
much more than 10,000 —
<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2023-Announcements/2023-11-3-Governor-Hochul-and-Mayor-Adams-Announce-Launch-of-Induction-Stove-Challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NYPA
has said</u></a> that 12 other housing authorities representing more
than 300,000 housing units have signed up to support the initiative.
There’s also a good chance that the stoves will be eligible for at least
a 30% tax credit.
</p>
<p>
Once the contract is fully awarded, the next step will be for Copper to
produce a single unit for testing before moving on to the pilot stage,
where it will produce and install 100 stoves. If the pilot is
successful, the agencies will purchase at least 10,000 units.
</p>
<p>
The same agencies are in the pilot phase of a similar contest called
Clean Heat For All, which aims to bring new heat pumps to market that
can be installed in a window rather than requiring costly construction
work. Last winter, they ran a pilot in two dozen NYCHA apartments with
the winning units — models from the startup Gradient and veteran
manufacturer Midea. NYPA
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2024/pr-20240610.page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported
this summer</u></a> that the units “provided consistently comfortable
temperatures throughout the pilot period, with residents reporting high
levels of satisfaction,” and said it planned to study the tech’s cooling
capabilities next.

Climate Future Will Be Decided in Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg3MTA3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDg4NDQyNn0.XCx8FLVjH0lnl3JjNPb-GI3WpD1qXLcDTLG93jfdr4o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In 2022, the <em><em>Arizona Republic</em></em> published a sentence
many Democrats had dreamed of reading for decades: “Arizona,”
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/greg-moore/2022/11/17/arizona-election-blue-state-despite-its-red-reputation/10719234002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
paper announced</u></a>, “is a blue state.”
</p>
<p>
At the time, it felt true. In 2020, Joe Biden won the Grand Canyon State
— only the second time a Democrat had done so since Arizona broke for
Harry Truman in 1952 — and Democrat Mark Kelly defeated Republican
Sen. Martha McSally in a special election to fill the late John McCain’s
Senate seat, a victory that helped the Inflation Reduction Act get over
the finish line. The 2022 midterm elections confirmed that the
Democrats’ wins in the state hadn’t just been a one-time occurrence:
Kelly successfully defended his seat, securing a full term; Katie Hobbs
won the governorship; and Adrian Fontes
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/12/arizona-secretary-of-state-election-winnner-adrian-fontes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beat
a January 6 participant</u></a> to become the secretary of state,
Democrats all.
</p>
<p>
With the 2024 election still a little more than a week away, it’s too
soon to tell whether the blue state proclamations of 2022 were
premature. But Arizona hasn’t been looking terribly cerulean. In 2023,
the Republican-held state legislature
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/08/16/arizona-legislature-passes-just-one-pro-environment-bill-in-2024/74707414007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a>
eight of 16 anti-environment bills introduced and stranded 22
pro-environment bills without committee hearings. Republican voter
registration in the state has also swelled since 2016 as Democratic
rolls stayed relatively stagnant,
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/10/voter-registration-trends-in-arizona-could-sway-the-2024-election/75587426007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>giving
the GOP an edge</u></a> in a place where 10,457 votes can
<a href="https://azmirror.com/2021/09/23/arizona-audit-finds-biden-won-by-more-votes-and-no-evidence-of-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>make
all the difference</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Arizona is just one state out of 50 (or 11 electoral votes out of 538,
if you prefer), but it represents a curious microcosm of the high-stakes
climate and energy elections happening all over the country this
November. Or perhaps it is <em><em>not</em></em> so curious: Arizona is
on the front lines of the climate-related impacts of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/colorado-river-deal-dave-white" target="_self"><u>droughts</u></a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/phoenix-heat-100-degrees-record" target="_self"><u>longer
and nastier heat waves</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/az-sota-we" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ozone
pollution</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-power-has-a-wildfire-smoke-problem" target="_self"><u>wildfires</u></a>,
while also being in a position to weigh the trade-offs of crucial clean
energy developments like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>building
new energy transmission</u></a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/resolution-copper-mine" target="_self"><u>critical
mineral mining</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/sunzia-lawsuit-blm" target="_self"><u>utility-scale
solar</u></a>. “It’s like an incubator. There’s just so much happening
here, it’s ready to burst,” Jane Conlin, a co-leader of the Tucson
chapter of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, which has been engaging in
get-out-the-vote efforts with the Environmental Voter Project, told me.
</p>
<p>
Aside from its electoral college allocations, the most consequential
race in Arizona this cycle will be for outgoing Independent
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024#:~:text=Arizona%E2%80%99s%20Senate%20seat" target="_self"><u>Senator
Kyrsten Sinema’s seat</u></a>. The state is currently leaning
<a href="https://www.270towin.com/2024-senate-election/consensus-2024-senate-forecast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slightly
toward</u></a> Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego, who could help
stem
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/republicans-good-shot-flipping-senate/story?id=115061885" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
total hemorrhaging of blue seats</u></a> from the Senate — which, in
turn, would have implications for the passage of any
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>decarbonization
legislation</u></a> in the next administration.
</p>
<p>
Two U.S. House elections in Arizona could similarly help determine the
balance of power on Capitol Hill come January. AZ-01 is the wealthiest
congressional district in the state, in the northeastern corner of
Phoenix’s Maricopa County, where a former E.R. doctor is trying to
unseat a seven-term Republican incumbent in a battle that has
<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2024/06/27/arizona-democrats-hammer-david-schweikert-over-abortion-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>centered</u></a>
on abortion access. (The district is also home to the Rio Verde
Foothills, which made national headlines in 2022 when Scottsdale
<a href="https://grist.org/housing/rio-verde-foothills-arizona-water-megadrought/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cut
off its water supply</u></a> due to drought-related shortages.)
</p>
<p>
But it’s the other race, in the sixth congressional district spanning
the suburbs of Tucson, that looks more like a proxy battle between
different climate ideologies. Kirsten Engel — who previously worked for
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and serves as the co-director
of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Arizona — is
challenging Juan Ciscomani,
<a href="https://www.kjzz.org/2024-05-31/content-1881515-trump-endorses-az-congressman-who-isnt-maga-republican-gop-consultants-say-it-helps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
Trump-endorsed</u></a> moderate conservative who has backed
<a href="https://ciscomani.house.gov/media/press-releases/ciscomani-joins-bipartisan-bill-streamline-residential-access-solar-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>residential
solar projects</u></a>,
<a href="https://tucson.com/opinion/column/arizona-opinion-helping-to-secure-our-future-water-supply/article_300497a4-8fd7-11ef-aef5-d394bbb23d09.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promoted
himself</u></a> as an advocate for a “secure water future,”and, earlier
this year,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/07/carbon-border-tax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>co-sponsored
a bill</u></a> seen as a first step toward a carbon border tax. (As his
opponents quickly point out, he also voted against the IRA; Ciscomani
has
<a href="https://dccc.org/juan-ciscomani-bankrolled-by-lobbyist-involved-with-selling-out-arizonas-water-to-saudi-arabia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
been tied</u></a> to a groundwater scandal involving a Saudi
Arabian-owned alfalfa farm.)
</p>
<p>
Engel previously lost a tight election against Ciscomani in 2022, and
has made abortion
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/12/arizona-latina-abortion-border/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
centerpiece</u></a> of her campaign, too. But she has also gone
aggressively after the Republican for
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary?code=E04&cycle=2024&ind=E04&mem=Y&recipdetail=H" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
alignment</u></a> with the mining industry, including his support for a
proposed open-pit copper mine that opponents say will pollute Tucson’s
air and waterways; supporters, meanwhile, say it’s critical to create a
domestic supply chain for the energy transition. The League of
Conservation Voters, which identified the sixth congressional district
election as one of its priority races, is running ads in the state
<a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/house/az-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>playing
up this pollution angle</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Engel herself has slammed the proposed mine, which would be built on
public lands, as a “giveaway” to a foreign mining company, and
<a href="https://x.com/EngelForArizona/status/1524869554589032458" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>touted</u></a>
the need to protect the region’s “spectacular scenic vistas and the
tourism economy.” She has also sought to go toe-to-toe with Ciscomani on
water conservation, though as <em><em>Grist</em></em> has
<a href="https://grist.org/politics/arizona-election-water-drought/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
drought and water rights can be tricky for Arizona politicians to run on
because voters don’t have a firm grasp of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/colorado-river-deal-dave-white" target="_self"><u>how
the complicated policies work</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The future of climate policy at the regional and municipal levels in
Arizona is also in play. Democrats could potentially flip the balance of
power in the state House and Senate, each branch currently having just a
one-seat Republican advantage, and restart movement on the slate of
stalled pro-environmental bills. (The Democratic governor’s term runs
through 2026.) “The state legislature in Arizona is so critical,” John
Qua, the campaign manager of Lead Locally, told me. “Not only does
building a democratic trifecta get the state closer to passing policy
that tackles climate change in some of the ways we might more typically
understand it — like moving towards clean energy — but it also makes it
much likelier that the state legislature will pass water conservation
policy.”
</p>
<p>
The 11 races are “all at a razor-thin margin,” Qua told me, though
climate is unlikely to be the issue that tips the balance in any of
them. That goes for just about any race in Arizona — except the state’s
Corporation Commission, which Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/public-utilities-arizona-montana-louisiana#:~:text=what%E2%80%99s%20at%20stake.-,Arizona,-During%20the%20two" target="_self"><u>covered
earlier this week</u></a>. Currently, the ACC is operating with a
four-to-one Republican majority, but with three Democrats, two Green
party candidates, and three Republicans (including an incumbent) running
to fill three seats, there’s a wide-open chance that candidates
sympathetic to clean energy policy, including the state’s massive solar
opportunity, could take control.
</p>
<p>
“Arizona could lead the world in solar power if politicians would only
let it,” Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder and executive director of the
Environmental Voter Project, told me. “But that isn’t going to happen
unless the climate movement starts showing up in unstoppable numbers
whenever there’s an election.”
</p>
<p>
Conlin, who co-leads the Tucson chapter of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby,
has been working on the ground to reach the 230,000 potential first-time
environmental voters that Stinnett and his team have identified in the
state. (EVP numbers
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/lithium-arkansas-reserves-discovery" target="_self"><u>released
earlier this week</u></a> showed that those who vote based on climate
issues were about 20% more likely to have submitted an early vote than
the average voter.) During a recent folklife festival CCL volunteers
attended, “I think about only 25% of people [we engaged with] were
really aware of the Arizona Corporation Commission,” Conlin told me. But
she’s excited nevertheless: This year, the ACC poll is on the front of
Arizonans’ ballots, rather than the back, making it harder for even
low-information voters to overlook.
</p>
<p>
The state is also a case study of how an elected body as small and
seemingly insignificant as a school board can make a difference in the
progress toward decarbonization. The Tucson Unified School District
board of governors will vote next week on
<a href="https://tucsonagenda.substack.com/p/the-climate-agenda-students-take" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
climate action plan</u></a> that would set a goal of reaching net-zero
emissions by 2045. If successful, TUSD would be one of the first school
districts in the nation to have implemented such a plan.
</p>
<p>
Arizona is not the only state in the country that, as Colin put it,
feels “on this cusp of being able to reach out — not only to see a 50%
cut in emissions but 100%. It’s doable, it’s within reach.” Pennsylvania
and Michigan voters will also have opportunities to elect politicians
who will advance climate legislation, and voters in Washington,
California, and New York can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lets-go-washington" target="_self"><u>defend</u></a>
their states’ progress. But it’s Arizona where the stakes seem
especially immediate — and high. “It’s supposed to be 96 [degrees
Fahrenheit] here today,” Conlin marveled when we spoke this week, at the
end of October.
</p>
<p>
I could hear the weariness in the voices of the organizers I spoke to
after a long, hard-fought season; candidates are set to make their final
pitches to voters next week. Early-voting ballots are already in the
mail or in hand. The CCL has just one final day of canvassing planned,
on November 2. The polls will close three days later, at 7 p.m. local
time, and then the count will begin.

<p class="drop-caps">
Tesla got to thump its chest this week. In a Wednesday
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-tsla-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2024-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earnings
call</a> with investors, CEO Elon Musk and company shared
better-than-expected sales and financial numbers for the third quarter
of 2024. That good news caused the electric vehicle-maker’s stock to
rebound following what had been a disappointing sales year so far, with
the slump compounded by a tepid reaction to the “We, Robot” event
earlier in October, when Tesla debuted its autonomous Cybercab.
</p>
<p>
A few important factors underlie Tesla’s big rebound: Manufacturing
costs fell, the refreshed Model 3 is doing well, and the Cybertruck has
begun to sell in big enough numbers to help the company’s bottom line.
Then there was this line from Musk’s
<a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presentation</u></a>:
“Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles –
including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the
first half of 2025.”
</p>
<p>
You might think that sentence suggests the
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-ev-new-generation-cheaper-smaller-car/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long-rumored</u></a>
$25,000 Tesla is, at last, right around the corner. But when pressed by
an investor whether the company would indeed build a “$25,000
non-robotaxi regular car model,” Musk called the idea
“<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-building-regular-tesla-pointless-self-driving-earnings-stock-2024-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointless</u></a>.”
“It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we
believe,” he continued, saying that it’s “blindingly obvious” autonomy
is the future.
</p>
<p>
It’s beginning to look like the idea of a little human-driven Tesla that
costs as much as a Toyota Corolla will forever be a fantasy. One could
argue, though, it has already done its job. The promise of the “Model
2,” perpetually dangled in front of the world as something just a few
years away, enticed many people — including, crucially, investors — to
believe Musk would extend his dominance of the EV market and truly
conquer the car industry by offering an entry-level electric car for the
masses. But if that ever was the plan, it isn’t anymore.
</p>
<p>
Tesla has always played fast and loose with deadlines and promises. It
finally launched the Model 3 after years of promising the $35,000 Tesla,
though obtaining the base version of the car at that price was a major
challenge. In fact, most Model 3s that sold cost well into the $40,000s,
if not more. The cheapest one you can
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>order</u></a>
today starts at $43,000 before incentives.
</p>
<p>
The even smaller Tesla has been the topic of long-running rumors, buoyed
by signals from the mothership. In 2022, Musk simply had
“<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/25000-cheap-tesla-dead/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
much on his plate</u></a>” to work on the car. In 2023, when Tesla
finally began to sell a new vehicle, it was not a cheap compact but the
Cybertruck. Musk then reportedly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_self"><u>tabled</u></a>
the cheap Tesla indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
That didn’t stop the optimism. In the leadup to this week’s earnings
call, one major analyst
<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-25k-not-robotaxi-is-bigger-influence-on-stock-analyst-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
it was the potential $25,000 EV, not the Cybercab or any of Tesla’s
future-looking autonomous projects, that would drive the company’s
success (and stock price) in the short term. After all, an EV with that
MSRP could have a true cost under $20,000 after tax credits. At that
point, it would undercut even entry-level gas cars in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
During the call, while scoffing at the idea of a small Tesla for
carbon-based drivers, Musk pointed out that the Cybercab is technically
a $25,000 car after tax breaks (though, this is the same man who, while
throwing his weight behind the Trump campaign, has said that ending the
EV tax credit would benefit Tesla). It’s just one that happens to have
no steering wheel and no pedals. <em>Teslarati</em>
<a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-earnings-call-live-blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concluded</u></a>
that the company’s promise of more affordable cars to come in the
beginning of next year refers to lowering the prices of Tesla’s current
offerings, not any plans to debut something new and different.
</p>
<p>
The EV market has changed a lot since the dawn of this decade, when
Tesla rolled out the Model Y and cemented its grip on the industry. The
rise of the super-cheap Chinese EV in particular spooked not only
Western governments, but also American car companies that had dreams of
competing for the lower end of the market. Combine that with Musk’s
insistence that Tesla remain a lean, innovative firm rather than
maturing into a boring EV-maker and you arrive at this point, with Musk
going all in on trying to win the race for the true self-driving car
instead of diversifying the kinds of vehicles it’s actually selling
today.
</p>
<p>
History could prove him right. Still, that’s cold comfort for anyone
who’d been hoping for a small, cheap EV they could drive themselves.
It’s certainly possible to envision the Cybercab adapted for human
drivers, but Musk is adamant that won’t happen. So an affordable, normal
EV will have to come from elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
And it might. Despite gloomy headlines about a supposed slump, EV sales
in America are steadily
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/738776/us-overtakes-europe-in-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rising</u></a>.
At the less expensive end of the market, Chevy has
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/22/35000-chevy-equinox-ev-finally-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>begun</u></a>
selling the base-level version of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-equinox-ev" target="_self"><u>Equinox
EV</u></a> at the promised $35,000, which could fall under $30,000 with
tax breaks. The Chevy Bolt should be even cheaper than that when it
<a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2024/03/next-gen-chevy-bolt-ev-to-arrive-for-2026-model-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>returns</u></a>
for the 2026 model year. Detroit has a whole lot to figure out in the
coming years about how to build electric vehicles profitably, but, at
the very least, the legacy carmakers might actually offer you an
affordable EV — with a steering wheel.

<h2 id="musk-gives-44-million-more-to-back-trump">Musk gives $44 million
more to back Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Elon Musk gave about $44 million to his pro-Donald Trump
spending group during the first half of October, federal disclosures
showed on Thursday, as the billionaire stepped up his efforts for the
Republican candidate in the November 5 election.</p>
<p>The contributions, disclosed in a filing to the Federal Election
Commission by Musk’s America PAC group, come after a prior report showed
he gave the group about $75 million over three months between July and
September.</p>
<p>America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely
contested states that could decide the election, also disclosed spending
more than $47 million in the first half of October.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for
canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk — the world’s
richest person — plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a
razor-thin election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Separately, Trump’s campaign reported spending more than $88 million
on ads in the first half of the month, leaving him with $36 million in
the bank for the final stretch of campaigning, according to a separate
filing to the Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign raised $16 million during the period.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign, which has outraised and outspent Trump’s
campaign in recent months, reported spending more than $130 million on
ads in early October. Harris’ campaign raised $97 million during the
first half of the month and had $119 million in the bank on October 16,
according to its disclosure.</p>
<p>Another conservative super PAC, the Sentinel Action Fund, also
reported receiving $2.3 million from Musk.</p>
<p>Musk’s donations to America PAC propel him into the exclusive club of
Republican mega donors, a list that also includes banking heir Timothy
Mellon and casino billionaire Miriam Adelson.</p>
<p>As part of its plan to stir support for Trump, America PAC has been
giving away $1 million per day to a randomly selected signatory of its
online petition, which is only open to registered voters in battleground
states.</p>
<p>The Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC warning that the
giveaways may violate federal law, CNN reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The petition falls into a gray area of election law, and legal
experts are divided about whether Musk could be running afoul of
prohibitions on paying people to register to vote.</p>
<p>Musk named two winners, one in Michigan and one in Wisconsin, in
posts on social media platform X late Thursday following the DOJ
warning. America PAC has not responded to requests for comment about the
letter.</p>

<p>MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Friday denied a Wall Street Journal report
about regular contacts between Elon Musk and President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>“No, this is not true,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told
reporters. Peskov said that Putin had one contact with Musk — the
world’s richest man — and it was before 2022.</p>
<p>The Journal said Musk had been in regular contact with Putin since
late 2022. Peskov said the report was absolutely false.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Bettors think they’ve already figured out the presidential election
winner, with many odds sites predicting a slim victory for former
President Trump less than two weeks away from Voting Day. But according
to FHN Financial’s Christopher Low, there are plenty of reasons to be
skeptical of any predictions in such a tight election, including betting
markets’ own recent track record. Plus, we take a trip to a factory in
Texas that’s giving a second life to batteries used in EVs. And, one
Scottish manufacturer is reusing onion skins in their packaging to
reduce plastic waste.

to this year’s United Nations Emissions Gap Report</a> released on
Thursday.<br/> <br/> “Unless global emissions in 2030 are brought below

in tandem with accelerated mitigation action in this decade.”<br/> <br/>
Greenhouse gas emissions rose by 1.2% in 2023, which is faster than the
annual average rate of change in the 2010s. Current policies would
likely deliver 2.9 degrees of warming by 2100, while warming might be
limited to around 2.5 degrees if countries meet the policy commitments
they’ve already made.

id="unions-rejection-of-boeing-offer-threatens-jobs-at-aerospace-suppliers">Union’s
rejection of Boeing offer threatens jobs at aerospace suppliers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Striking workers’ rejection of planemaker Boeing’s BA.N latest
contract offer has created a fresh threat to operations at aerospace
suppliers such as family-run Independent Forge.  </p>
<p>If the strike by more than 33,000 U.S. Boeing workers persists
another month, the Orange County, California supplier might need to cut
its operations from five to three days a week to save money and retain
workers, president Andrew Flores said.  </p>
<p>While Independent laid off a few employees already, letting more go
is not an appealing option, he said. The 22 workers who remain are
critical for the company, especially when the strike eventually ends and
demand for its aluminum aircraft parts rebounds.  </p>
<p>“They are the backbone of our shop,” Flores said this week. “Their
knowledge, I can’t replace that.”  </p>
<p>Wednesday’s vote by 64% of Boeing’s West Coast factory workers
against the company’s latest contract offer, further idling assembly for
nearly all of the planemaker’s commercial jets, has created a fresh test
for suppliers such as Independent, which opened in 1975.  </p>
<p>Boeing’s vast global network of suppliers that produce parts from
sprawling modern factories or tiny garage workshops, was already
stressed by the company’s quality-and-safety crisis, which began in
January after a mid-air panel blow-out on a new 737 MAX.   </p>
<p>Demand for parts has dropped, hitting suppliers after they spent
heavily to meet renewed demand for planes in the post-pandemic
era.   </p>
<p>How small suppliers such as Independent navigate the strike, which
began on Sept. 13, is expected to affect Boeing’s future ability to
bring its plane production back online.   </p>
<p>More job cuts?   </p>
<p>Five Boeing suppliers interviewed by Reuters this week said
continuation of the strike would cause them to furlough workers, freeze
investment, or consider halting production.  </p>
<p>Boeing declined comment.  </p>
<p>Seattle-area supplier Pathfinder, which runs a project to attract
young recruits to aerospace and trains them alongside its skilled
workers, will likely need to lay off more employees, CEO Dave Trader
said.  </p>
<p>Pathfinder, which let go one-quarter of its 54 workers last month,
will also need to send more of its aerospace students back to their high
schools, instead of training them in the company’s factories, Trader
said.  </p>
<p>Suppliers on a regular call on Thursday with Boeing supply-chain
executives said they expect the strike will continue for weeks, one
participant told Reuters.  </p>
<p>About 60% of the 2.21 million Americans who work in the aerospace
industry have jobs directly linked to the supply chain, according to the
U.S. industry group Aerospace Industries Association.  </p>
<p>Those suppliers’ decisions to reduce staffing could create a vicious
cycle, as they will put added strain on Boeing’s efforts to restore and
eventually increase 737 MAX output above a regulator-imposed cap of 38
after its factories re-open, analysts say.  </p>
<p>“Once we get back, we have the task of restarting the factories and
the supply chain, and it’s much harder to turn this on than it is to
turn it off,” CEO Kelly Ortberg told an analyst call on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>“The longer it goes on, the more it could trickle back into the
supply chain and cause delays there,” Southwest Airlines LUV.N Chief
Operating Officer Andrew Watterson said of the strike on
Thursday.   </p>
<p>Shares of Boeing suppliers fell on Thursday. Howmet HWM.N lost 2%.
Honeywell HON.O and Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N fell 5% and 3%,
respectively, following weak results.  </p>
<p>Spirit Aero, Boeing’s key supplier, which has already announced the
furlough of 700 workers on the 767 and 777 widebody programs for 21
days, has warned it would implement layoffs should the strike continue
past November.  </p>
<p>“It’s starting up the supply chain that is likely to be the biggest
worry, especially if they have taken action to cut workers due to a lack
of Boeing orders,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said
by email.  </p>
<p>A strained supply chain, Spirit Aero’s challenges and increased
regulatory oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration over MAX
production, means it could take up to a year from the strike’s end to
get 737 output back to the 38-per-month rate, Stallard said.</p>

want “human skills”, but are employers willing to train them?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Employees are overwhelmingly in favor of upskilling in areas we call
“human skills”, which include things like leadership, communication, and
adaptability, according to a recent survey. However, more than one in
three workers say their jobs offer little to no opportunity to improve
these skill sets. We look at what’s behind the gap. Plus, airline
customers may find themselves bracing for higher ticket prices as
companies report high demand for seats and less supply. And, we hear
from one of the winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in Economics about
why China’s economic model has succeeded thus far — and why it might
face challenges in the future.

astronauts return to Earth after being delayed by Boeing’s capsule
trouble, Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Four astronauts returned to Earth on Friday after a nearly
eight-month space station stay extended by Boeing’s capsule trouble and
Hurricane Milton.</p>
<p>A SpaceX capsule carrying the crew parachuted before dawn into the
Gulf of Mexico just off the Florida coast after undocking from the
International Space Station mid-week.</p>
<p>The three Americans and one Russian should have been back two months
ago. But their homecoming was stalled by problems with Boeing’s new
Starliner astronaut capsule, which came back empty in September because
of safety concerns. Then Hurricane Milton interfered, followed by
another two weeks of high wind and rough seas.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched the four — NASA’s Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt
and Jeanette Epps, and Russia’s Alexander Grebenkin — in March. Barratt,
the only space veteran going into the mission, acknowledged the support
teams back home that had “to replan, retool and kind of redo everything
right along with us … and helped us to roll with all those punches.”</p>
<p>Their replacements are the two Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore
and Suni Williams, whose own mission went from eight days to eight
months, and two astronauts launched by SpaceX four weeks ago. Those four
will remain up there until February.</p>
<p>The space station is now back to its normal crew size of seven — four
Americans and three Russians — after months of overflow.</p>

deal raises questions about US Indo-Pacific strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW DELHI — This week’s movement toward rapprochement between the
leaders of China and India is raising questions about New Delhi’s
commitment to the Quad, the loose four-nation alliance widely seen as a
U.S.-led bid to counter Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>India’s participation in the grouping, which also includes Japan and
Australia and is formally known as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue,
has been at least partly driven by a vexing border dispute that has seen
repeated clashes between Chinese and Indian troops along their Himalayan
border.</p>
<p>Presidents Narendra Modi of India and Xi Jinping of China agreed
Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia to reduce their
differences and jointly work out a plan for patrolling the border. The
agreement is expected to result in closer political and economic
ties.</p>
<p>“The thaw in India-China relations is a boon to both countries. This
is particularly significant for China because India may now be less
inclined to confront Beijing as part of Quad,” Zhiqun Zhu, professor of
political science and international affairs at Bucknell University, told
VOA. “In this sense, the effectiveness of Quad would be diluted with a
less enthusiastic India.”</p>
<p>India and China share certain common interests as the two largest
developing nations. China was India’s biggest trade partner last year,
though there are signs that the U.S. might take its place this year.</p>
<p>“This suggests that the U.S. may wish to push forward its
Indo-Pacific strategy without relying too heavily on support from
India,” Zhu said.</p>
<p>The Quad has served as an important element in the American effort to
establish a network of alliances and partnerships to counter China’s
rising economic and military power, marked by its aggressive behavior in
the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“By remaining relatively informal, the Quad can quietly achieve many
of the functions performed by NATO, up to and including military
contingency planning,” wrote James Jay Carafano, a security affairs
expert, on the website of the Liechtenstein-based think tank
Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG.</p>
<p>China’s state-run newspaper Global Times described the improved
China-India relationship as a response to U.S. and Western European
efforts to reduce their economic reliance on China, a process sometimes
described as “decoupling.”</p>
<p>“In the context of the US ‘decoupling’ strategy, the strengthened
cooperation between China and India takes on even greater significance,”
the paper said in an editorial published Thursday. “The pressures from
the US ‘decoupling’ strategy and technological restrictions have
heightened regional tensions and increased geopolitical risks for both
nations.”</p>
<p>The editorial also said that the potential geopolitical shift has
already generated market optimism. “It’s based on the recognition of
their complementary strengths and the vast opportunities for
collaboration across diverse sectors, including manufacturing,
infrastructure and sustainable development.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether the border agreement will be
sustained in the face of decades-old differences between the world’s two
most-populous countries.</p>
<p>They fought a war in 1962 and were engaged in a border clash in 2020
in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. There is some concern
in India about whether China will in fact pull back troops in the
disputed border areas and implement the agreement on the ground.</p>
<p>India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said
Thursday that “agreements, once reached, must be scrupulously respected”
and “disputes and differences must be settled by dialogue and
diplomacy.”</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with key negotiators
Thursday to discuss a Mideast cease-fire during a stop in the
negotiating hub of Qatar. The parties have spent months trying to broker

hostages believed to still be held in Gaza. VOA White House

House pushes for de-escalation in Mideast, warns North Korea for aiding
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration continues to push for a cease-fire between
Israel and Hamas in Gaza and de-escalation between Israel and Hezbollah
in Lebanon. In Europe, the administration has revealed intelligence that
North Korean troops are being trained in Russia to help its war
efforts.</p>
<p>VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with White House
national security communications adviser John Kirby on the latest
developments in the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: [U.S.] Secretary [of State] Antony Blinken today warned Israel
against a protracted campaign in Lebanon. He warned Israel to avoid
civilian casualties, not to endanger U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese
army. The only way Israel can do that is by operating a targeted
campaign. Is it operating a targeted campaign?</p>
<p>White House national security communications adviser John Kirby: We
would like to see no civilian casualties and no damage to civilian
infrastructure to the maximum extent possible. We have told the Israelis
that we don’t support near daily strikes in densely populated areas, and
that’s part of the message that [Blinken] delivered when he was there.
We believe that there’s still a diplomatic path to be found here to
bring this conflict with Hezbollah and Lebanon to a close. That was one
of the reasons that Secretary Blinken traveled there.</p>
<p>VOA: Do you support Israeli demands for an expanded U.N. peacekeeping
force to include north of the Litani River?</p>
<p>Kirby: I’m not going to get into any specific proposals one way or
the other. I don’t think we’re at that point right now. … What we
support is de-escalation. What we support is minimization of civilian
casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. We also continue to
support Israel’s right to defend itself.</p>
<p>VOA: What about Israel’s efforts to dismantle Hezbollah
infrastructure in Lebanon? How far can you accept the cost of that?</p>
<p>Kirby: Look, they have done an extraordinary amount of work towards
already dismantling Hezbollah’s capability, including the killing of
[Hassan Nasrallah], their leader. Hezbollah is not Hamas. They are in
many ways superior in terms of military capability and resources. So,
it’s a different kind of a fight. It’s a different kind of enemy that
they face.</p>
<p>And I would remind that even just in the last 24 hours, more than 100
rockets and drones [were] launched by Hezbollah towards Israeli citizens
who are just trying to live their lives on that side of the Blue Line,
as well. So, it remains a viable threat to the Israeli people, and we’re
going to continue to talk to the Israelis about how they go after that
threat, because how they do that matters significantly.</p>
<p>VOA: Ten days ago, the administration set a 30-day deadline for
Israel to improve Palestinian access to aid. Can you update us on the
progress?</p>
<p>Kirby: There has been some progress, and as you heard Secretary
Blinken say during his travels, more needs to be done. But there has
been an increase of trucks flowing into North Gaza; specifically, the
Erez Crossing is back open. We want to see more.</p>
<p>VOA: Israel announced that Mossad chief David Barnea will meet with
CIA Director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister in Doha. Is there
anything about that meeting that you can tell us?</p>
<p>Kirby: Without talking to the CIA director’s travel or meetings, I
won’t do that. But you saw the prime minister already announced that
there’s another meeting in Doha of negotiators, and we’re grateful to
see this progress continue. We’re grateful to see yet another meeting
here, and we’re hopeful that now, with Mr. Sinwar gone, Hamas might be
more willing to sit down and negotiate in good faith and come up with a
solution that gets a cease-fire of at least some duration, and gets
those hostages home with their families where they belong, as well as to
your earlier question, gives us a pause in the fighting that can help us
all work towards a more dramatic increase in humanitarian
assistance.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that more can’t be done now. Even while Gaza
remains an active combat zone, more can be done, more should be done.
But if you can end the fighting, then you can definitely make it easier
to get humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>VOA: Does the administration see [Yahya Sinwar’s brother] Mohamed
Sinwar as somebody with influence on the negotiations?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think it’s unclear right now where the leadership of Hamas
goes, and I would just say that we’re watching this very, very closely,
as you might imagine, monitoring it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how Hamas tries to fill the vacuum left by Sinwar, they
have an opportunity before them right now to help end this war, to get
those hostages home and to do the right thing.</p>
<p>VOA: Let’s move on to North Korea and Russia. [Russian President]
Vladimir Putin appears to have implicitly acknowledged what you laid out
yesterday, that North Korean troops are in Russia to help their war
efforts. How do you see this?</p>
<p>Kirby: We see it the same way as we laid out yesterday. We know that
there are at least several thousand North Korean soldiers in three
military training bases in eastern Russia. Now, exactly what they’re
being trained to do, we don’t know. Whether and how they’ll be deployed
in this war against Ukraine, we don’t know that either. But it is a
violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that, I would remind you,
Russia themselves signed up to. The procurement of arms and ammunition
from North Korea is a violation of U.N. Security Council existing
resolutions that Russia signed up to. We’re going to watch this very,
very closely.</p>
<p>VOA: What is the geopolitical implication for Kim Jong Un now that
he’s willing to send his troops to die for Putin? Are you concerned that
in return, Russia could help North Korea improve the reach of their
ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] to hit American cities, for
example?</p>
<p>Kirby: That’s what we’re watching closely to see. We don’t know
exactly what Mr. Kim thinks he’s getting out of this arrangement. And
it’s worrisome. As you heard the secretary of defense say the other day,
this potential move here by the North Koreans to put soldiers on the
ground, literally skin in the game when it comes to fighting Ukraine, is
not only going to have implications in Ukraine and on that battlefield,
but it’s going to have implications in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>What we don’t know right now is exactly what that looks like. What
does Kim think he’s getting out of this? It is possible that there could
be some provision by Russia to enhance and improve North Korean military
capabilities? Again, that would just further destabilize a very tense
region.</p>
<p>VOA: You said these North Korean soldiers are legitimate military
targets. But would you consider taking direct military action against
them as the head of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence, Mike Turner, suggested?</p>
<p>Kirby: The United States is not directly involved in combat
operations in or around Ukraine. The president has been clear about
that. We are providing Ukraine with the kinds of tools, capabilities and
weapons that they need to defend themselves. And when we say they’re
legitimate military targets, these North Korean soldiers, we mean they
would become legitimate military targets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces
should they be involved in operations against Ukraine.</p>
<p>VOA: China has said that they have no information on these North
Korean troops. Do you believe them?</p>
<p>Kirby: I’ll let the Chinese speak to what they see or they don’t see.
What I said yesterday stands today. We’re going to certainly be
communicating with our PRC [People’s Republic of China] counterparts
about this.</p>
<p>VOA: Last month you also confirmed that Iran transferred shipments of
domestic missiles to Russia. Now we have these North Korean troops
fighting for Russia. What is your assessment of this trilateral
cooperation?</p>
<p>Kirby: Number one, it certainly shows Mr. Putin’s increasing
desperation, and quite frankly, his weakness, that he has to reach out
to the likes of Kim Jong Un and the supreme leader in Tehran for
assistance to fight Ukraine. Clearly, he’s under a lot of military
pressure. We know he’s losing 1,200 soldiers a day. He suffered more
than 530,000 casualties in the time he’s been fighting in Ukraine. So,
he’s clearly under pressure, and he’s not … being honest with the
Russian people about what he’s doing and what he’s losing and how bloody
and lethal this war has been on his own armed forces.</p>
<p>Number two, I think it certainly speaks to worrisome defense
relationships between these countries that are now growing and
deepening. They’re worrying not just because of what might be the
effects in Ukraine, they’re worrying because of what might be the
effects in other parts of the world. You and I were just talking about
what Kim Jong Un might be getting out of this. Let’s talk about Iran,
because Iran, certainly we know, is interested in advanced aviation
capabilities, for instance, from Russia. Now, again, I don’t know that
we’ve seen it all consummated yet, but Iran being able to benefit from
Russian military technology is also not good for the Middle East
region.</p>

id="ship-owner-manager-in-us-bridge-collapse-agree-to-pay-102m-for-cleanup">Ship
owner, manager in US bridge collapse agree to pay $102M for cleanup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the
deadly Baltimore bridge collapse have agreed to pay more than $102
million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice
Department, officials said Thursday. </p>
<p>The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge,
officials said in a news release announcing the agreement. That
construction project could cost close to $2 billion. The state of
Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among
others. </p>
<p>The settlement comes a month after the Justice Department sued the
ship’s owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and manager, Synergy Marine
Group, both based in Singapore, seeking to recover funds from the
cleanup. </p>
<p>The Justice Department alleged that the electrical and mechanical
systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to
lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the
Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The ship was leaving Baltimore for
Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. </p>
<p>Six men on a road crew, who were filling potholes during an overnight
shift, fell to their deaths. Cleanup crews worked around the clock
searching for bodies and removing thousands of tons of mangled steel and
smashed concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River. The Dali
remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with collapsed
steel trusses draped across the ship’s damaged bow. </p>
<p>“This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government’s
cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and
Synergy and not the American taxpayer,” Principal Deputy Associate
Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement. </p>
<p>The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of
Baltimore and put many local longshoremen out of work before the channel
was fully opened in June. It interrupted East Coast shipping routes as
the port is one of the busiest in the country, especially for cars and
farm equipment. </p>
<p>Grace Ocean and Synergy filed a court petition just days after the
collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the
most expensive marine casualty case in history. </p>
<p>Court records show attorneys for both parties said in a joint filing
Thursday that they had reached a settlement agreement and requested
dismissal of the Justice Department’s claim, which sought $103 million
in cleanup costs. </p>
<p>The claim is one of many filed in an expansive liability case that
will ultimately determine how much the ship’s owner and manager will owe
for their role in causing the disaster. The other claims are still
unresolved. They’ve been filed on behalf of the victims’ families,
companies whose business has suffered as a result of the collapse,
municipal entities and more.</p>

It’s a fair question. Nuclear energy, after all, can produce vast
amounts of electricity without emitting planet-warming greenhouse gas
pollution. It already generates
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/BTL/2023/02-genmix/article.php#:~:text=Electricity%20generation%20from%20coal%20falls,fall%20to%2037%25%20in%202024." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
zero-carbon electricity</u></a> in America than wind turbines and solar
panels do combined; unlike renewables, it can provide power all day and
night, even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. The
countries that have seen the largest year-over-year drops in carbon
pollution —
e.g. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/france?country=FRA#what-are-the-country-s-annual-co2-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>France</u></a>
— have generally done so by building a new fleet of nuclear reactors.
</p>
<p>
It’s also a factual question. For years, even as Democrats railed
against fossil fuels, they dilly-dallied on nuclear issues. The party’s
leaders in statehouses and legislative chambers around the country
worked to shut down aging nuclear reactors or approved nuclear-skeptical
regulators. President Barack Obama cheered next-generation nuclear in
speeches, but appointed extremely nuclear-skeptical regulators to
oversee the industry. (One of his first appointees to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Gregory Jaczko,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/i-oversaw-the-us-nuclear-power-industry-now-i-think-it-should-be-banned/2019/05/16/a3b8be52-71db-11e9-9eb4-0828f5389013_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
called for a global ban</u></a> on nuclear energy since leaving the
government.)
</p>
<p>
Even though nuclear reactors produced most of America’s zero-carbon
electricity, they remained the, well,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>glowing-blue-haired</u></a>
step-child of America’s grid: Democrats regularly railed against fossil
fuels, and they felt comfortable paying lip service to far-off atomic
technologies, but they did not lavish nuclear with the unqualified
support that they gave renewables. Instead, they let the nuclear
industry slip into senescence. This mild toleration was punctuated by
moments of extreme cognitive dissonance, such as when New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo
<a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Newsroom/2021-Announcements/2021-04-29-Governor-Cuomo-Announces-Successful-Closure-of-Indian-Point-Nuclear-Power-Plant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shut
down the Indian Point nuclear power plant</u></a> in 2021 without lining
up new zero-carbon generation to replace it —
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/20/nuclear-plant-closure-carbon-emissions-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leading
the state’s carbon emissions to soar</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Democrats didn’t have to do much to kill nuclear: At the same
time, the market was doing a perfectly good job of it. As cheap natural
gas flooded the American energy system in the 2010s, more and more
nuclear plants became too expensive to run. From 2012 to 2022, 12
nuclear reactors
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46820/3#:~:text=Twelve%20U.S.%20nuclear%20power%20reactors,%25%20of%20U.S.%20nuclear%20capacity)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shut
down in the U.S.</u></a>, taking nearly 10,000 megawatts of low-carbon
generation offline.
</p>
<p>
That was the status quo as recently as 2020 or even 2022. And it has
remained the status quo in energy commentary. “What role, if any, does
[Vice President Kamala Harris] see for nuclear power in her energy and
climate plans?”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/kamala-harris-election.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
<em><em>The New York Times </em></em>columnist Bret Stephens last month,
in a column titled “What Harris Must Do to Win Over Skeptics (Like Me).”
At the vice presidential debate earlier this month, Republican nominee
JD Vance even alluded to the argument amid a broader paean to fossil
fuels. “If you really want to make the environment cleaner, you’ve got
to invest in more energy production,” Vance said. “We haven’t built a
nuclear facility — I think one — in the past 40 years.”
</p>
<p>
In fact, Vance is wrong: The United States recently turned on
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=57280#:~:text=The%20first%20commercial%20nuclear%20power,reactor%20came%20online%20in%202016." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>two
new nuclear reactors</u></a> in Georgia — the first newly built reactors
in America in 30 years. But this idea — <em><em>Why aren’t we building
more nuclear reactors? Why don’t Democrats do more to help nuclear? —
</em></em>has been a throughline of energy punditry since well before
Vance was a best-selling author.
</p>
<p>
So I want to intervene in this conversation and note that the answer has
now changed. Democrats are a pro-nuclear party now — not uniformly, but
then again,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-musk-live" target="_self"><u>neither
are Republicans</u></a>. Over the past several years, Democratic
lawmakers and officials have adopted a slate of aggressively pro-nuclear
policies and characterized the technology as pro-climate. Secretary of
Energy Jennifer Granholm has called for America
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-musk-live" target="_self"><u>to
build a new wave</u></a> of <em><em>conventional</em></em> nuclear
reactors — going much further than Obama ever did. Sometimes working
with Republicans — but sometimes working alone, too — Democrats have
pushed billions of dollars of support toward conventional nuclear
reactors and the nascent advanced nuclear industry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It’s worth stepping back here and going over what has actually changed.
</p>
<p>
For the past 10 years at least, both parties have been credibly
committed to building up the advanced nuclear industry — the theoretical
next generation of nuclear reactors that will be smaller, cleaner, and
safer than the behemoths built during the Cold War. During the Trump
administration, Congress
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/president-trump-signs-bill-boost-advanced-nuclear-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a>
a bipartisan bill meant to push along the advanced nuclear industry. It
also
<a href="https://clearpath.org/our-take/the-energy-act-of-2020-a-monumental-climate-and-clean-energy-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a>
the Energy Act of 2020, which authorized a demonstration program for
advanced nuclear reactors.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration has continued this support. The bipartisan
infrastructure law created
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/civil-nuclear-credit-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
$6 billion program</u></a> that would pay existing nuclear power plants
to stay open. At least
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/civil-nuclear-credit-award-cycle-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.1
billion of that money</u></a> will go to keeping Diablo Canyon,
California’s only operating nuclear facility and its largest power
plant, from shutting down; it was originally slated to close in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Biden also
<a href="https://environmentamerica.org/updates/feds-extend-nuclear-power-subsidy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extended</u></a>
a key program that indemnifies the nuclear industry for the cost of
nuclear accidents and disasters above $16.1 billion.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the most important nuclear law passed in the past five years
is the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s signature
climate package. For the first time ever, that law embraced the idea of
“technology neutrality,” which means that electricity generated by
nuclear reactors is now on the same footing as power from wind turbines
or solar panels. If a method of electricity generation emits almost no
carbon, then the government subsidizes it under the IRA.
</p>
<p>
The law is already helping restart nuclear reactors that have recently
closed such as the Palisades reactor in Michigan and Three Mile Island
in Pennsylvania. The utility giant NextEra is also
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nextera-beats-third-quarter-profit-estimates-renewables-strength-2024-10-23/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploring
plans to restart</u></a> the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, which
closed in 2020. If those go through, then it will be able to take
advantage of Inflation Reduction Act funding, as well.
</p>
<p>
Lawmakers from both parties have continued to back advanced nuclear
research and deployment. Under Biden, Congress passed
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1111/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
ADVANCE Act</u></a>, containing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-21-advance-act" target="_self"><u>a
hodgepodge of policies</u></a> meant to help the advanced nuclear
industry. Among other changes, it instructs the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to move faster when approving new reactor designs, and it
changes that agency’s mission statement to more affirmatively support
nuclear development.
</p>
<p>
Biden administration officials haven’t just backed that legislation,
they’ve also asserted that it will “help us build new reactors at a clip
that we haven’t seen since the 1970s,” as Michael Goff, who leads the
Energy Department’s nuclear office,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/newly-signed-bill-will-boost-nuclear-reactor-deployment-united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bragged</u></a>
in a statement.
</p>
<p>
The irony is that nuclear plants are now doing well enough that Congress
has clawed back some of the money from the bipartisan infrastructure
law. The industry, seemingly, doesn’t need it any more, and no
additional nuclear reactors have been scheduled to shut down. In 2024,
Congress stripped up to $3.7 billion to pay for a program to produce a
type of high-assay used in next-generation nuclear reactors.
</p>
<p>
Democrats have begun to brag about their nuclear policymaking efforts on
the campaign trail, as well. In
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/us/politics/kamala-harris-raleigh-nc-economy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>her
speech on economic policy</u></a> earlier this month, Kamala Harris
included “advanced nuclear” in a list of technologies that her
administration would support.
</p>
<p>
“We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace; remain dominant in AI
and quantum computing, blockchain and other emerging technologies;
expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing,” she said,
“so the next generation of breakthroughs — from advanced batteries to
geothermal to advanced nuclear — are not just invented but built here in
America by American workers.”
</p>
<p>
The party’s Senate candidates
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-election-nuclear_n_6712ccc1e4b0e2b6e54c0e1c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
become</u></a> even more positive about nuclear energy. Candidates in
Arizona, Michigan, Florida, and Texas have all backed nuclear power, as
the reporter Alexander Kaufman at <em><em>Huffpost
</em></em><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-election-nuclear_n_6712ccc1e4b0e2b6e54c0e1c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
shown</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This transformation has happened even though the big big environmental
groups that have historically set the party’s energy priorities have
<em><em>not </em></em>changed their mind on nuclear. Although many green
groups
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/environment-funding-nuclear-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
scaled back</u></a> or defunded their anti-nuclear activism, their
rhetoric remains staunchly anti-nuclear. The Sierra Club
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/nuclear-free" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>calls</u></a>
nuclear power a “uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity” and
states on its website: “The Sierra Club remains unequivocally opposed to
nuclear energy.”
</p>
<p>
The party’s approach to nuclear hasn’t informed all its policy yet. The
Biden administration’s nominations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-20-spring-2024/matthew-marzano-is-exactly-who-i-said-he-was" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
been criticized</u></a> by pro-nuclear advocates for continuing the
status quo or for not knowing enough about the advanced nuclear
industry.
</p>
<p>
But Democrats are, by any measure, much more pro-nuclear now than they
were 10 years ago — and <em><em>much </em></em>more pro-nuclear than
they were a decade before that. (It’s often forgotten now that President
Bill Clinton’s would-be climate policy,
<a href="https://www.carbontax.org/some-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
BTU tax</u></a>, also would have levied a fee on nuclear reactors.)
Republicans also remain fairly pro-nuclear: Donald Trump
<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/us-news/trump-vows-to-make-electricity-cheap-with-hundreds-of-new-power-plants-and-modular-nuclear-reactors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
promised</u></a> to approve “hundreds of new power plants,” including
“new reactors,” during his presidency.
</p>
<p>
What remains unclear is whether both parties can persist in this new
pro-nuclear formation. Nuclear energy is popular with a majority of the
public, but only just; 56% of Americans
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/05/majority-of-americans-support-more-nuclear-power-in-the-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favor
building more nuclear power plants</u></a>, according to the Pew
Research Center. And there are signs, if you squint, of a potential
coming era of GOP skepticism of nuclear power — part of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/opinion/liberal-conservative-crank-realignment.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
party’s broader turn</u></a> against science and high-trust
institutions.
</p>
<p>
Signs like: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-adds-rfk-jr-gabbard-transition-team-2024-08-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been added</u></a> to Trump’s transition team,
<a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-5111/rfk-jr-elon-musk-talk-nuclear-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes</u></a>
that nuclear power is unsafe and uneconomical. Even Trump himself, in
conversation with Elon Musk,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-musk-live" target="_self"><u>has
worried</u></a> about “nuclear warming” — it’s not clear what he was
talking about, but it might be nuclear war — and said that nuclear has a
“branding problem.” Even if Trump continues to support the idea of
building “new reactors,” his potentially illegal plan
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/05/trump-inflation-reduction-act-00177493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
claw back</u></a> the Inflation Reduction Act’s unspent funding may lead
to pandemonium in the sector. If the nuclear industry is now planning on
receiving IRA subsidies, then ending those subsidies — especially in a
messy or chaotic way — could spell disaster.
</p>
<p>
There are identity-driven reasons for Republicans to turn on nuclear,
too: The nuclear energy industry is
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-workforce-trends-nuclear-energy#:~:text=Nuclear%20is%20more%20unionized%20than,collective%20bargaining%20agreement%20in%202023." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
unionized</u></a> than any other energy source, and it requires a highly
institutionalized and educated workforce. (Yet not all the trends augur
a realignment: Nuclear power
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8665401/nuclear-power-gender" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remains
much more popular</u></a> with men than women.)
</p>
<p>
For now, though, both parties — including Democrats — support building
new nuclear power plants. The economics are good for once, too. The
question now is how long that will hold.

<h2 id="biden-administration-approves-nevada-lithium-mine">Biden
administration approves Nevada lithium mine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday gave final approval to
ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine in Nevada, the first domestic
source of the battery metal to be permitted by President Joe Biden’s
administration and one that will become a key supplier to Ford and other
electric vehicle manufacturers. </p>
<p>Shares of the Australia-based critical minerals miner jumped more
than 20% in New York trading on Thursday afternoon before easing
down. </p>
<p>The approval ends a more-than six-year review process during which
regulators, ioneer and conservationists tussled over the fate of a rare
flower found at the mine site, a tension that exposed the sometimes
competing priorities between climate change mitigation efforts and
biodiversity protection. </p>
<p>The permit, which had been expected by the end of the year, comes
amid a flurry of recent moves by Biden officials to support critical
minerals production and offset China’s market dominance.  </p>
<p>It also unlocks a $700 million loan from the U.S. Department of
Energy, as well as a $490 million equity investment from Sibanye
Stillwater to fund the project. </p>
<p>“This is a science-based decision,” Laura Daniel-Davis, the Interior
Department’s acting deputy secretary, told Reuters. “We’re trying to
send a signal that there’s no topic with greater importance than
addressing climate change.” </p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which is controlled by the
Interior Department, on Thursday issued the Rhyolite Ridge project’s
record of decision — essentially the mine’s permit — and said the
project will “include significant protections for the local ecosystem”
and help create hundreds of jobs in the rural region.  </p>
<p>The project, roughly 362 kilometers north of Las Vegas, Nevada,
contains enough lithium to power roughly 370,000 electric vehicles each
year. Construction is slated to begin next year, with production
commencing by 2028, a timeline that would make Rhyolite Ridge one of the
largest U.S. lithium producers alongside Albemarle and Lithium
Americas. </p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey has labeled lithium a critical mineral
vital for the U.S. economy and national security.  </p>
<p>“We’re proud to be the first U.S. lithium mine permitted by the Biden
administration,” James Calaway, ioneer’s chairman, told Reuters. </p>
<p>The project will extract lithium as well as boron, a chemical used to
make ceramics and soaps, from a clay-like deposit. The lithium will be
processed on site into two main derivatives used to make batteries, and
the company said it plans to recycle half of all the water used at the
site, higher than the industry average. </p>
<p>Ford and a joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic have agreed to
buy lithium from the mine.</p>

<h2 id="fewer-americans-trust-the-news-the-question-is-why">Fewer
Americans trust the news; the question is why</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Polls show that Americans’ trust in news reporting is at an all-time
low. And while the decline has many causes, it reflects both the
changing media landscape and the values of media consumers.</p>
<p>Nearly 250 years since the principle was enshrined in the U.S.
Constitution, a majority of Americans still agree that a free press is
crucial to a democratic society, according to polling by the Pew
Research Center. But how they feel about the existing press is a
different matter.</p>
<p>The same polls show that only one-third of Americans believes the
country’s media report the news objectively. And a September Gallup poll
reveals that Americans’ overall trust in mass media has declined to an
all-time low of 32%.</p>
<p>Much of the narrative around declining faith in media has been shaped
by political partisanship. The last time that America saw such low
levels of media confidence was in 2016, when Donald Trump amplified
longstanding conservative complaints about liberal media bias by
attacking critical coverage of his presidential campaign as “fake
news.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, self-identified Republicans report less trust in media,
reaching a low of 11% compared with 58% for Democrats.</p>
<p>However, partisan trends don’t capture the whole picture. While
partisan divergence in media confidence significantly widened during the
presidency of Republican George W. Bush, overall trust in media
institutions has been declining for supporters of both parties as well
as independents since Gallup first began tracking it in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The rise of partisan cable news networks in the 1990s and digital
news, along with social media in the 2000s, has reflected and
exacerbated this trend. And dissatisfaction with perceived bias in
coverage of conflicts such as the Iraq War or Israel’s invasion of Gaza
has also reduced trust in traditional news sources among left-leaning
Americans, often driving them toward unreliable alternative sources.</p>
<p>As Americans lose trust in traditional media, they also engage less
with it. While over half of adults in the U.S. now report getting their
news from social media, audiences and advertising revenue have shrunk
when it comes to newspapers and TV news.</p>
<p>In fact, part of the story behind declining trust in media is
Americans across the political spectrum becoming less interested in news
overall. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are experiencing news fatigue
while 38% report that they follow the news closely, compared with 51% in
2016.</p>
<p>Do Americans want independent journalism?</p>
<p>The simultaneous loss of trust and interest in news media has raised
questions beyond simple accusations of partisan bias. While criticism of
the media often focuses on whether the core principles of independent
journalism are being upheld, the principles themselves may not be
popular.</p>
<p>A recent study by the Media Insight Project found that common
journalistic values such as amplifying marginalized voices, holding
power to account or increasing public transparency do not enjoy majority
support.</p>
<p>In fact, such values may not be as integral to journalism as is
commonly believed. As Columbia University journalism professor Michael
Schudson writes, the modern idea of journalism as an independent
investigative force and a check on government power has been a fairly
recent development.</p>
<p>And amid today’s rapid social, political and technological changes,
the role that people expect journalism to play in society may once again
be shifting.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-intelligence-agencies-ordered-to-embrace-ai">US
military, intelligence agencies ordered to embrace AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have new
marching orders — to more quickly embrace and deploy artificial
intelligence as a matter of national security.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden signed the directive, part of a new national
security memorandum, on Thursday. The goal is to make sure the United
States remains a leader in AI technology while also aiming to prevent
the country from falling victim to AI tools wielded by adversaries like
China.</p>
<p>The memo, which calls AI “an era-defining technology,” also lays out
guidelines that the White House says are designed to prevent the use of
AI to harm civil liberties or human rights.</p>
<p>The new rules will “ensure that our national security agencies are
adopting these technologies in ways that align with our values,” a
senior administration official told reporters, speaking about the memo
on the condition of anonymity before its official release.</p>
<p>The official added that a failure to more quickly adopt AI “could put
us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals.”</p>
<p>“Because countries like China recognize similar opportunities to
modernize and revolutionize their own military and intelligence
capabilities using artificial intelligence, it’s particularly imperative
that we accelerate our national security community’s adoption and use of
cutting-edge AI,” the official said.</p>
<p>But some civil liberties advocates are raising concerns that the new
guidelines lack sufficient safeguards.</p>
<p>“Despite acknowledging the considerable risks of AI, this policy does
not go nearly far enough to protect us from dangerous and unaccountable
AI systems,” according to a statement from the American Civil Liberties
Union’s Patrick Toomey.</p>
<p>“National security agencies must not be left to police themselves as
they increasingly subject people in the United States to powerful new
technologies,” said Toomey, who serves as deputy director of ACLU’s
National Security Project.</p>
<p>The new guidelines build on an executive order issued last year that
directed all U.S. government agencies to craft policies for how they
intend to use AI.</p>
<p>They also seek to address issues that could hamper Washington’s
ability to more quickly incorporate AI into national security
systems.</p>
<p>Provisions outlined in the memo call for a range of actions to
protect the supply chains that produce advanced computer chips critical
for AI systems. It also calls for additional actions to combat economic
espionage that would allow U.S. adversaries or non-U.S. companies from
stealing critical innovations.</p>
<p>“We have to get this right, because there is probably no other
technology that will be more critical to our national security in the
years ahead,” said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan,
addressing an audience at the National Defense University in Washington
on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The stakes are high,” he said. “If we don’t act more intentionally
to seize our advantages, if we don’t deploy AI more quickly and more
comprehensively to strengthen our national security, we risk squandering
our hard-earned lead.</p>
<p>“We could have the best team but lose because we didn’t put it on the
field,” he added.</p>
<p>Although the memo prioritizes the implementation of AI technologies
to safeguard U.S. interests, it also directs officials to work with
allies and others to create a stable framework for use of AI
technologies across the globe.</p>
<p>“A big part of the national security memorandum is actually setting
out some basic principles,” Sullivan said, citing ongoing talks with the
G-7 and AI-related resolutions at the United Nations.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure that people around the world are able to seize the
benefits and mitigate the risks,” he said.</p>

id="blinken-announces-135m-in-additional-us-aid-for-palestinians">Blinken
announces $135M in additional US aid for Palestinians</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — In a latest diplomatic push to end the conflicts
in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
said Thursday that negotiators will meet “in the coming days.” He also
announced $135 million in additional U.S. aid for Palestinian
civilians.</p>
<p>“In referring to negotiators coming back together, that was referring
specifically to negotiations on the return of hostages and a cease-fire
for Gaza, and that is the entire focus of their work. Separate from that
is work that we’re doing, also very intensely, on Lebanon to reach a
diplomatic resolution,” Blinken said during a press conference in Doha,
Qatar, alongside Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar’s prime
minister and foreign minister. </p>
<p>The United States is in discussions with regional counterparts on a
plan that allows Israel to withdraw from Gaza, ensures that Hamas cannot
reconstitute and supports the Palestinian people in governing, securing
and rebuilding Gaza.</p>
<p>More humanitarian aid</p>
<p>“Today, we’re announcing an additional $135 million in humanitarian
assistance, water, sanitation, maternal health for Palestinians in Gaza,
in the West Bank, as well as in the region,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>He emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, noting the extraordinary challenges faced daily by people there.
“That’s all the more urgent with winter approaching,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>This announcement brings total U.S. humanitarian aid to more than
$1.2 billion since Oct. 7 of last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, France hosted an international conference Thursday in
Paris to raise funds to help those affected by the war between Israel
and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p>
<p>France announced a pledge of $108 million, while Germany said it is
contributing $103 million for aid in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Cease-fire talks</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether Hamas is prepared to engage in the
upcoming cease-fire talks after the death of its leader, Yahya
Sinwar.</p>
<p>“We are closely coordinated with Egypt on any kind of initiatives
that will emerge on the table. Today, there [is] an ongoing discussion
between Egypt and Hamas. We hope that these discussions will yield to
something positive. And the discussion that will come afterward, it will
be a follow-up for that,” Qatar’s Al Thani told reporters.</p>
<p>Al Thani added that U.S. negotiators will meet soon with Israeli
counterparts in Doha to attempt a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that he
welcomed Egypt’s efforts in attempting to broker a deal that would bring
Israeli hostages held in Gaza home.  </p>
<p>Earlier this week, a report by the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development painted a grim picture of the economic impact of the Israeli
military operation in Gaza from October 2023 to May 2024.</p>
<p>The report said that even if the war were to end tomorrow, it could
take 350 years for Gaza’s devastated economy to recover to the fragile
state it had been in before the Israel-Hamas war started in October
2023.</p>
<p>‘General’s Plan’</p>
<p>On Thursday, Blinken renewed the United States’ opposition to any
Israeli reoccupation of post-war Gaza and “fully and fundamentally”
rejected the so-called Generals’ Plan, a proposal by retired Israeli
generals allegedly aimed at blocking humanitarian aid to northern Gaza
to starve out Hamas terrorists.</p>
<p>Blinken also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
assured him during their meetings that this is not the policy of the
Israeli government. “The government of Israel says that it is not the
policy of Israel,” Blinken told reporters.</p>
<p>In a video message to the Paris aid conference, U.N.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate cease-fire
and urged meaningful steps toward full implementation of Security
Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, which call for the long-term
disarmament of Hezbollah and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon.</p>
<p>Guterres noted that more than 1.2 million people have been displaced
or affected by fighting in Lebanon.</p>
<p>“I call on Lebanon’s leaders to take resolute steps toward ensuring
fully functional state institutions to address the country’s pressing
political and security challenges,” Guterres said.</p>
<p>On the battlefields</p>
<p>Israel’s military said Thursday it conducted a new round of
airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons production sites in Beirut’s
southern suburbs.</p>
<p>Lebanon’s military said three of its soldiers were killed in an
Israeli strike while they were conducting a rescue operation near the
village of Yater in southern Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israel has said its fight is with Iran-backed Hezbollah, not Lebanon,
in a conflict that has raised fears of wider regional hostilities.</p>
<p>Medics in Gaza said an Israeli strike hit a school that was being
used as a shelter in Nuseirat, killing at least 17 people, most of them
women and children.</p>
<p>On another front Thursday, Syria’s Defense Ministry said Israeli
airstrikes hit Damascus, killing at least one soldier and injuring seven
other people.</p>
<p>Israel rarely comments on strikes against targets in Syria, but it
has hit Iran-linked targets there for years as part of a campaign to
halt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and disrupt Iranian proxies.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on
southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people
and took 250 people as hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100
hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than
42,847 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel
saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas
militants.</p>
<p>The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have
designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations.</p>

<h2 id="us-targets-sudan-weapons-procurement-director-with-sanctions">US
targets Sudan weapons procurement director with sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against
Mirghani Idris Suleiman, a leading figure in the Sudanese Armed Forces
(SAF) efforts to get weapons for the war against the Rapid Support
Forces (RSF), the Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>As director of Defense Industries Systems (DIS), the Sudanese army’s
primary weapons procurement arm, “Idris has been at the center of
weapons deals that have fueled the brutality and scale of the war,” the
statement said.</p>
<p>“Today’s action underscores the essential role that key individuals
like Mirghani Idris Suleiman have played in procuring weapons,
perpetuating violence, and prolonging the fighting in Sudan,” said
Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence.</p>
<p>DIS was sanctioned last year by Treasury.</p>
<p>Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan in a conflict with
the army that the United Nations says has caused one of the world’s
worst humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>The war has displaced more than 10 million people, driven parts of
the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers
that have given both sides material support.</p>

Ebb uses electricity to separate seawater into acidic and basic streams,
then returns the basic stream back to the ocean, where it reacts with
carbon in the water and promotes faster CO2 absorption from the air. The
company must achieve and verify an initial 1,300 tons of CO2 removal
before Microsoft commits to buying the remainder. The company has a
small pilot project up and running at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory in Washington, and is working with federal scientists and the
University of Washington to measure and model the results.

<li>The IRA’s X-Factor is in full effect
</h3>
<p>
The Treasury Department issued final rules this morning for the Advanced
Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, also known as 45X. The program is
the backbone of the Inflation Reduction Act, offering incentives for
domestic manufacturing of the components of solar panels, wind turbines,
and batteries, subsidizing every step of the supply chain for these
technologies. During a call with reporters on Wednesday, Deputy
Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo said the tax credit has already
driven more than $126 billion in private sector clean energy
manufacturing investments.<br/> <br/> The biggest change introduced in
the final rule that the administration highlighted was allowing critical
mineral extraction — separately and in addition to mineral processing —
to qualify for a 10% tax credit. “The U.S. has major deposits of
critical minerals like lithium and palladium. Extracting and processing
them here in America, as opposed to relying on China, Russia, and other
countries with weak worker and environmental protection, is an economic
and national security priority for us,” Adeyemo said.

people trust government to deliver prosperity? Ask this year’s Nobel
laureate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Americans nowadays don’t agree on much, but most have one thing in
common: disappointment in their government and the direction of the
country. According to University of Chicago Professor James Robinson,
who jointly won the Nobel Prize in Economics this year, a lot of this
discontentment can be tied back to economic inequality and a perception
that economic gains of the past few decades haven’t substantially
improved normal people’s lives. Plus, an update on Boeing as striking
machinists reject the company’s latest offer in ongoing labor
negotiations.

When Zara Bode, a musician from Brooklyn, New York, first walked into
the old seven-bedroom Victorian in downtown Brattleboro, Vermont, it
just felt right. Her husband, also a traveling musician, had grown up
nearby. “You walk in this house and you’re like, <em><em>oh, there’s a
good vibe</em></em>,” she told me. Since the 1890s, when it was built,
it had been a community health center and a food co-op, before being
lovingly restored by the older woman who sold it to Bode and her husband
in January of 2020. Bode hoped to make it their forever home, a place
for friends and family to gather.
</p>
<p>
Within a month of moving in, she and her husband both lost their incomes
in the pandemic. Then they made a brutal discovery: the house was
ruinously expensive to heat.
</p>
<p>
They spent all their time huddled in the kitchen with their two young
children in front of the wood burning cookstove and kept the thermostat
at 65. Even so, they were running through a full tank of oil every nine
days. Each delivery cost more than $1,000, adding up to twice their
mortgage every month. They had to ask for government emergency
assistance.
</p>
<p>
Bode started asking around to other families, who told her about a
state-funded program that gives out 0% weatherization loans with
deferred repayment to low-income families. She got quotes from two
different reputable companies, each of which proposed using polyurethane
spray foam insulation in the large basement. The buzz in the community
was that spray foam is a miracle product — so incredibly insulating that
it would cut their heating oil needs down by two-thirds or or more. But
Bode was protective of the old Victorian. “I knew it was lucky for us to
get this house in the first place. We don’t have the money to make
mistakes,” she says.
</p>
<p>
Without any outside expert to turn to, desperate for relief, and
grateful for Vermont’s robust social safety net, she went for it.
</p>
<p>
She would come to regret it.
</p>
<p>
<strong><br/> </strong>

<p class="drop-caps">
To hit its climate goals, the U.S. is going to have to upgrade its old
housing stock. Residential energy use accounts
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
about 20% of U.S. carbon emissions</u></a>, and the lion’s share of that
energy is used to heat and cool homes. At the same time, low-income
families are struggling more than ever to shoulder the financial burden
of doing that. In 2023, the number of American families needing
assistance
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/us/new-england-heating-costs-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>jumped
by 1.3 million</u></a> to over 6 million.
</p>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act is aiming to tackle these twin crises, with
a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/save/rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tax
credit</u></a> covering 30% of the cost of insulation and air-sealing
materials, up to $1,200 annually per household. So far only New York has
an active IRA-funded home rebate program, but more states have applied
to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-heat-pump-rebates" target="_self"><u>start
handing out funds</u></a> to homeowners over the next year, which should
also help shield Americans from the health effects of extreme
temperatures.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, insulating an old home is a delicate and complex
process. Improper installation can lead to mold, dry rot in your home’s
framing and roof, and poor indoor air quality that can make you sick.

<p>
“It’s potentially a huge problem,” Francis Offerman, a.k.a. Bud, an
industrial hygienist who does indoor air quality testing for homeowners
(and lawyers) who suspect a house or apartment is making its inhabitants
ill, told me. “Especially if your mindset is, <em><em>we’re going to
just spray foam the home</em></em>, and that’s it.”
</p>
<p>
Bode reached out to me last year after she read my
<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/05/22/i-wanted-to-cry-devastating-risks-of-spray-foam-insulation-hidden-from-vermont-homeowners/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>viral
story for </u><u><em><em>VT Digger</em></em></u></a>, which raised the
alarm about the risks of spray foam insulation in particular. (Though
experts say any insulation done badly can cause problems.) She and her
family had vacated their Victorian for a few days in early 2021 while
the basement was spray foam insulated. When they moved back in, Bode was
struck by the bad paint smell. That eventually went away, and oil
deliveries dropped from every nine days to every three weeks.
</p>
<p>
But then she realized the basement, which used to be bone dry, was now
damp all the time. She bought two industrial dehumidifiers that run
constantly, and still the smell of mildew wafts up through the
floorboards. Bode has allergies to mold and mildew and worries the bad
air quality could affect her kids, who also have allergies and asthma.
She’s had to move all her furniture and art out of the basement lest it
get damaged.
</p>
<p>
When she saw my article, she felt a mix of emotions. On the one hand,
after having her concerns dismissed by the insulation company, she
finally felt validated. “That was the first time that I had heard about
air exchangers and other things I can’t afford,” Bode told me about
reading my article. But she wondered, “Did I ruin a house that’s been
standing strong for 140 years?”
</p>
<p>
The kind of person that could have advised Bode on how to safely
insulate her historic home would be someone trained in building science
— that is, someone educated in the physics of buildings, who can
identify moisture issues and air leaks, recommend appropriate materials
and HVAC solutions, and give you a step-by-step plan for implementing
them so your home stays healthy and whole.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, many insulation companies, architects, and contractors
have either never heard of or are actively hostile to these concepts,
which they see as expensive, unnecessary, overly complicated, and (in
the case of many spray foam contractors) an impediment to making the
sale.
</p>
<p>
“In the grand scheme of things, building science is a relatively new
field,”
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-werling-48b9b1b/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eric
Werling</u></a>, who recently retired after 30 years of directing the
U.S. Department of Energy’s Building America program to run his own
consulting business, told me. “People have studied structural
engineering for thousands of years. But air-tightening buildings is a
relatively new phenomenon.”
</p>
<p>
Up until the 1970s, people in the U.S. didn’t think much about
insulation. Then the energy crisis struck, and oil shortages caused
prices to skyrocket. President Jimmy Carter told Americans to put on a
sweater and turn down the thermostat. Letting all that expensive energy
flow outside suddenly seemed like a waste of money.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy launched its
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/wap/weatherization-assistance-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Weatherization
Assistance Program</u></a> in 1976 for low-income families and created
efficiency standards for commercial buildings that relied on the new,
synthetic materials that had emerged after WWII. The problem was, as
homes and commercial buildings were sealed, a lot of people got sick.
The most high profile cases were cancer from chronic radon exposure or
quiet but shocking deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. But there also
emerged the autoimmune-adjacent condition called
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796751/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sick
Building Syndrome</u></a>, a constellation of symptoms related to
breathing in VOCs from furniture, carpeting, pesticides, and cleaning
products circulating inside a tight building.
</p>
<p>
“The Department of Energy… screwed it up a lot at the very beginning,”
<a href="https://buildingscience.com/users/jlstiburek" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Joe
Lstiburek</u></a>, a longtime building science consultant, told me. But
the DOE started training its weatherization crews, establishing
standards for proper insulation, and providing additional funding for
safety measures, including mechanical ventilation. “America became a
world leader at figuring out how not to rot houses and how not to kill
people,” Lstiburek said.
</p>
<p>
Today, indoor air quality in the workplace has dramatically improved.
Aspects of building science have been codified in residential homes as
well, with some states requiring that new builds with a tight air seal
include mechanical ventilation. But nobody I talked to could point to
similar requirements for an existing home that has been retrofitted with
insulation. And when I asked Lstiburek if low-income renters and
homeowners have access to building science information and advice, he
said, “No, they do not.”
</p>
<p>
According to Werling, there are still probably fewer than a thousand
building science experts, and many are eyeing retirement. “Their
teachings have impacted thousands –– probably hundreds of thousands ––
of people in the construction industry.” He points to New York and
Wisconsin as two states that have had robust contractor training
programs for the longest. But he admits that’s still a small percentage
of the millions of people involved in construction in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
“There are just too many companies with people who don’t know enough
about the issues regarding moisture doing whatever they want and leaving
the homeowner with the bill,” Chris West, a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HouseCallsVermont" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Vermont-based
certified consultant</u></a> and trainer for Passive House, a design
standard for ultra-low-energy-consumption homes, told me. “Often these
companies have some kind of caveat in their contract that makes the
owner responsible for any future issues.”
</p>
<p>
To make things worse, our homes are more delicate today. New building
construction has largely switched from rot- and mold-resistant materials
such as hardwood and plaster to cheaper manufactured mold-prone
materials like plywood and drywall.
</p>
<p>
“Green” or “eco” home programs that advise homeowners focus solely on
energy efficiency, and tightened energy codes are requiring ever more
robust insulation without taking into account existing moisture problems
(such as a wet basement or unventilated bathroom), which are not rare.
<a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/562d25c6/files/uploaded/NIOSH-Dampness-and-Mold-Assessment-Tool_DMAT_Documentation-and-Data-Analysis-of-Dampness-and-Mold-Related-Damage-in-Buildings-and-Its-Application_2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NIOSH
estimates</u></a> about half of all homes have some sort of moisture or
mold issue. Residential contractors, architects, and developers,
meanwhile, are largely free to ignore building science concepts and go
about their business doing things the way they’ve always been done. And
there doesn’t seem to be a good plan in place to upskill contractors for
this next weatherization push or protect consumers from shoddy
workmanship.
</p>
<p>
<strong>“</strong>There isn’t an educational track that’s indoor air
quality in universities or colleges,” Offerman told me. “I’m 71 now. I’m
gonna retire eventually, and where are the replacements?”
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
I’ve talked to several homeowners who have been burned by bad insulation
jobs, and every one expressed dismay that contractors aren’t required to
at least share the potential risks or downsides of getting your home
weatherized. For example, homeowners may have to install mechanical
ventilation at an extra cost of a few thousand dollars, and spray foam,
as opposed to traditional batting insulation, is permanent and all but
impossible to remediate or take out.
</p>
<p>
This information is largely hidden from consumers, even savvy ones like
me. I was pitched spray foam by an energy auditor for my own old
farmhouse, and I had to go out and
<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2023/05/22/i-wanted-to-cry-devastating-risks-of-spray-foam-insulation-hidden-from-vermont-homeowners/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview
a half dozen experts for an article</u></a> and pay $1,000 to West to
drive two hours down to audit our house (again) and come up with an
alternative plan I was comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
Werling doesn’t want homeowners to be scared away from weatherizing
their homes. “In the vast majority of cases, homeowners are better off
when they insulate and air-seal their homes,” he said, “but it’s
important to be aware that the house is a complicated system of parts.
Hire the right contractor to help avoid potentially costly problems down
the road.” He points to the <u>Home Improvement Expert</u> section of
the Building America Solution Center from the U.S. Department of Energy,
which has detailed checklists you can go over with your contractor to
ensure the work is done properly. West suggests homeowners
<a href="https://www.phius.org/find-professional?_page=1&keywords=&_limit=50&professional_type=99" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>find
a certified consultant at Passive House Institute US</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The building science experts I spoke to suggested things like an
educational program for consumers so they know to ask about ventilation,
third party inspections before and after weatherization projects with
the results entered into the public record, pre-sale energy audits, and
mandatory building science training for contractors and their crews.
Offerman said weatherization programs should hold installers accountable
for insulating and ventilating according to the latest building science
standards as a condition of receiving funds.
</p>
<p>
The question is how many homeowners like Zara will have their homes and
health damaged before the situation is addressed. “It’s not that we
don’t know that this is happening,” Listiburek says. “It’s that it’s not
painful enough yet.”

<h2 id="boeing-strike-barrels-on-as-workers-reject-wage-deal">Boeing
strike barrels on as workers reject wage deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Boeing factory workers voted to reject a contract offer and
continue a more than five-week strike on Wednesday, in a blow to new CEO
Kelly Ortberg’s plan to shore up the finances of the struggling
planemaker.</p>
<p>The vote was 64% in opposition to the deal, which offered a 35% rise
in wages over four years, in a major setback for Ortberg who took the
top job in August on a pledge to work more closely with factory workers
than his predecessors.</p>
<p>The rejection of Boeing’s offer, which comes after 95% of workers
voted against a first contract last month, reflects years of resentment
from workers who felt cheated by the company in talks a decade ago and
deepens a financial crisis.</p>
<p>After the vote, union leaders said they were ready to immediately
resume negotiations with Boeing on the first major negotiation since
2014, when the company used the threat of moving production of the new
version of the 777 out of the region to push through a deal that ended
traditional pensions.</p>
<p>The union has been seeking a 40% pay rise and the return of the
defined-benefit pension.</p>
<p>Boeing factory workers were also venting frustration after a decade
when their wages have lagged inflation and critics have complained that
the planemaker spent tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks and
paid out record executive bonuses.</p>
<p>“This membership has gone through a lot … there are some deep
wounds,” the union’s lead contract negotiator Jon Holden told reporters
after the vote.</p>
<p>“I want to get back to the table. Boeing needs to come to the table
as well. Hopefully, we can have some fruitful discussions with the
company, and Mr. Ortberg, to try and resolve this.”</p>
<p>Boeing declined comment on the vote.</p>
<p>Some 33,000 machinists downed tools in Boeing’s West Coast factories
on Sept. 13, halting production of the best-selling 737 MAX as well as
767 and 777 wide-body programs.</p>
<p>Time is running out for Boeing, historically the largest U.S.
exporter, and its biggest union to reach a deal before the busy
political period surrounding the presidential election on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>With Boeing and IAM at a stalemate earlier this month, acting U.S.
Secretary of Labor Julie Su had helped get the latest offer presented
for a vote after attending in-person talks with both parties in Seattle
last week.</p>
<p>Holden said after the union vote that he would reach out to the White
House to see if the union could get more assistance negotiating with
Boeing.</p>
<p>“After the first contract offer was rejected, the honeymoon was over
on the labor reset. This further validates that,” said Scott Hamilton,
an aviation consultant.</p>
<p>“It’s bad news for everybody - Boeing, labor, suppliers, customers,
even the national economy.”</p>
<p>Boeing is the largest customer for a U.S. aerospace supply chain
already facing critical financial pressure.</p>
<p>Fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems warned that if the strike
continued beyond the end of November, there would be layoffs and more
drastic furloughs.</p>
<p>The company, which is in the process of being taken over by Boeing,
has already announced a 21-day furlough for 700 workers.</p>
<p>‘Defining moment’</p>
<p>Boeing has announced plans to cut 17,000 jobs and is closing in on a
plan to raise up to $15 billion from investors to help preserve its
investment grade credit rating, while some airlines have had to trim
schedules due to aircraft delivery delays.</p>
<p>Ortberg warned on Wednesday there was no quick fix for the ailing
planemaker.</p>
<p>In a quarterly earnings call, Boeing forecast it would burn cash
through 2025. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said after the vote
that the decision to prolong the strike could worsen the expected drain
on cash.</p>
<p>The specter of a quality crisis from a January mid-air panel blowout
hangs over Boeing.</p>
<p>Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said
this was now the “defining moment” of Ortberg’s short tenure and he
needed to get a deal across the line soon.</p>
<p>“There’s a feeling that he hasn’t handled this as well as he might
have,” Aboulafia said. “They’ve (Boeing) got to get this done, and
they’re in a position of weakness.”</p>
<p>The rejection from workers on Wednesday was the second in a formal
vote after the offer of a 25% pay rise over four years was rejected last
month, leading to the strike.</p>
<p>Many comments on social media and from workers outside voting
stations had cast doubt on a deal.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to go back on strike until we get a better deal,” Irina
Briones, 25, said after the vote.</p>
<p>“They took a bunch of numbers and moved them around to make them look
like they’re giving us more than they were,” said Josh Hajek, 42, who
has worked six years at Boeing on wing assembly.</p>
<p>Voting figures showed the two sides getting closer to a deal but
still a solid majority in favor of prolonging the strike.</p>
<p>Before the vote, Terrin Spotwood, a 20-year-old machinist in 737 wing
assembly, said he planned to approve the contract because the offer was
“good, but not great.” He said several coworkers planned the same
because they “can’t really afford to say no to this contract. They have
to go back to work.”</p>
<p>Even so, many workers are still angry about the last deal signed a
decade ago.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get what we want this time. We have better legs to
stand on this time than Boeing,” said Donovan Evans, 30, who works in
the 767 jet factory outside Seattle.</p>

<h2 id="new-evidence-china-russia-and-iran-targeting-us-elections">New
evidence China, Russia and Iran targeting US elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — There is new evidence China, Iran and Russia are
aggressively expanding their efforts to influence American voters to
potentially sway the result of the upcoming U.S. elections.</p>
<p>Two threat intelligence reports Wednesday, one from software giant
Microsoft and the other from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future,
detail growing activity by cyber actors linked to each country — all
aiming to impact U.S. public perceptions with less than two weeks before
voters go to the polls.</p>
<p>The biggest change, according to Microsoft, comes from Chinese-linked
actors known to researchers as Spamouflage or Taizi Flood.</p>
<p>“Chinese influence operations have recently taken a new turn,
shifting focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of
Congress,” Microsoft said, noting that starting in September, China has
targeted at least four prominent Republican lawmakers, all of whom are
known critics of the government in Beijing.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Chinese-linked accounts targeted Texas Republican
Michael McCaul, accusing the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee of “abusing power for personal gain.” </p>
<p>Late last month, other Spamouflage began going after Tennessee
Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, Microsoft said. And earlier this
month, the same effort began promoting Blackburn’s opponent in the
November 5 election.</p>
<p>Other targets include Alabama Republican Representative Barry Moore,
who was subjected to content criticizing his support for Israel, and the
vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco
Rubio, who was accused of corruption.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected the allegations in the
Microsoft report.</p>
<p>“The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs,”
embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told VOA Wednesday, echoing previous
Chinese denials. </p>
<p>“Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China,
which China firmly opposes,” he added.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers, however, said they were not surprised by the uptick
in malign activity.</p>
<p>“The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] cannot stand anyone who supports
and gives a voice to those they oppress; their response is to sanction
and attack,” McCaul said in a statement to VOA. </p>
<p>“I consider it a badge of honor when the CCP — a leading abuser of
human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people —
takes issue with my work,” he said. </p>
<p>Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee,
called for the Chinese influence efforts to “be taken very
seriously.”</p>
<p>“China is becoming increasingly more aggressive,” Rubio said in a
statement to VOA. “China’s goal is to shape American opinion on critical
issues and target specific candidates, especially those they view as
anti-China.”</p>
<p>Growing threats</p>
<p>The reports from Microsoft and Recorded Future warn Beijing is not
alone.</p>
<p>Specifically, the reports caution the Russian-linked cyber actors,
known to researchers as Storm-1679 or Operation Overload, have increased
their pace of operations over the past month and a half and are showing
signs that more influence operations are on the way.</p>
<p>“Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities,” said
the Recorded Future report.</p>
<p>Recorded Future said many of the Russian efforts, of late, have
sought to provoke anger toward the LGBTQ+ community “using
disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender
individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and
reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments.”</p>
<p>Other influence operations, the report said, are making use of
AI-generated voiceovers to emulate the style of U.S. broadcast
journalists.</p>
<p>Microsoft said the Russian cyber actors also have found ways to reach
additional U.S. voters by shifting much of the content from the Telegram
social media platform to X.</p>
<p>“Storm-1679 videos posted to X received higher levels of engagement,”
Microsoft said.</p>
<p>Microsoft researchers also warned there are signs Iran is also
ramping up its election interference efforts.</p>
<p>The Microsoft report says that in one instance, less than two weeks
ago, “an online persona operated by Iran began falsely posing as an
American and called on Americans to boycott the elections due to both
candidates’ support for Israel’s military operations.”</p>
<p>Russia and Iran, like China, have repeatedly denied any involvement
in efforts to meddle with the U.S. election.</p>
<p>But the new findings from Microsoft and Recorded Future align with
assessments from U.S. intelligence officials.</p>
<p>“Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent
on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine
Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what
they perceive to be in their interests,” according to a declassified
assessment issued Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials have previously said Russia has been
working to boost the chances of former president and current Republican
nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has been working to hurt Trump’s
reelection bid and instead buoy the campaign of Vice President Kamala
Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>And while there is little evidence to suggest China has sought to
affect the U.S. presidential race, intelligence officials have said
Beijing has been focusing its efforts on congressional and state and
local candidates perceived to be promoting policies detrimental to
Beijing’s interests.</p>

Justice Department warns Musk’s super PAC over $1 million giveaways</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department has sent a letter to Elon
Musk’s super PAC warning that the billionaire Tesla CEO’s $1 million
giveaways may violate federal law, several media organizations reported
on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>A letter from the department’s public integrity section, which
investigates potential election-related law violations, went to the
PAC.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and Musk’s America PAC did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>South African-born Musk, who has thrown his support behind Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of the November 5 election,
announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that
he was giving away $1 million each day until Election Day to someone who
signs his online petition supporting the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>He handed $1 million checks to two separate people over the weekend —
one to a man in Harrisburg on Saturday and another to a woman in
Pittsburgh on Sunday.</p>
<p>Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, so far has
supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal
disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump’s bid to regain
the White House.</p>

id="pakistans-weapons-programs-face-scrutiny-after-us-curbs">Pakistan’s
weapons programs face scrutiny after US curbs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>islamabad — The latest U.S.-imposed restrictions on entities
supporting Pakistan’s defense programs may hinder Islamabad’s future
efforts to acquire sensitive defense technologies and its collaboration
with China but are unlikely to affect Pakistan’s weapons development for
now, experts say.</p>
<p>Sixteen Pakistani firms were among 26 international companies added
this week to a U.S, “entities list,” making them ineligible to acquire
U.S. items and technology without government authorization.</p>
<p>Companies or individuals can be placed on the list if they are
“involved or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in
activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests
of the United States,” according to a U.S. Commerce Department
statement.</p>
<p>Nine of the 16 Pakistani companies added to the blacklist this week
were accused of being front companies for a previously sanctioned
company, Advanced Engineering Research Organization, deemed responsible
for the country’s cruise missile and strategic drone programs.</p>
<p>The remaining seven entities were added for contributions to
Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, the Commerce Department statement
said. Other companies added to the list this week were accused of
procuring U.S.-made items with military applications for China, Iran,
Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Defense analysts told VOA that addition to the list is unlikely to
slow Pakistan’s missile program, which has continued despite multiple
rounds of U.S. curbs on entities supporting it.</p>
<p>“It will not make a difference to Pakistan,” said Pakistani defense
analyst Salman Javed, who acknowledged that the country relies on the
United States for other defense technology needs. “I believe Pakistan’s
missile program is in an advanced stage, and U.S. restrictions will have
no impact on it.”</p>
<p>Former Pakistani army General Talat Masood said Pakistan has looked
more to China than the United States for “the expertise and technology”
needed to advance its drone program. But he said the new curbs might
affect Pakistan’s future collaboration with China in the field of drones
and their sale to other countries.</p>
<p>Pakistan has not officially responded to the latest restrictions but
objected last month when Washington blacklisted four companies, three
Chinese and one Pakistani, for “knowingly” transferring prohibited
equipment to Pakistan. Islamabad said the sanctions were imposed
“without any evidence whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Syed Irfan Ashraf, an assistant professor at the University of
Peshawar in Pakistan, said the United States has long prevented arms
technology sales in black markets to protect its interests. “However,
the timing and scrutiny of entities supporting Pakistan right now is
crucial” because of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>
<p>In September, the U.S. State Department acted against five entities
and one individual — all but one Chinese — that were involved in the
proliferation of ballistic missiles and controlled missile equipment and
technology to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Salman Ali, a Pakistani scholar at the School of Politics at the
Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, said the recent wave of U.S.
sanctions represents a distinct shift from the usual regulatory measures
observed since Pakistan’s de facto nuclearization and are aimed more at
pressuring China.</p>
<p>“Over the past six rounds of U.S. curbs, it’s clear that the focus
has been on the technical exchanges between China and Pakistan. These
sanctions are not only intended to curb the rapid advancement of missile
and drone programs but are also seen as a strategy to pressure China,”
Ali told VOA.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran are both members of the China-led regional alliance
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which opposed the unilateral
sanctions in its recently concluded summit October 16 in Islamabad.</p>

<h2 id="small-elections-with-big-consequences-for-clean-energy">3 Small
Elections With Big Consequences for Clean Energy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
On November 5, voters in a handful of states will cast their ballots not
just for their next president and state and local lawmakers, but also
for the members of an obscure body with outsized influence on the
country’s energy mix.
</p>
<p>
It’s called a public utilities commission. Every state has one, usually
composed of three to five officials who regulate the private companies
that deliver water, power, gas, and other services to residents and
businesses. Their job is to secure reliable energy at affordable rates,
which means these power players also preside over how quickly utilities
adopt clean energy and adapt to extreme weather, and how much companies
can raise customers’ rates to do so. In most of the U.S., utility
commissioners are appointed by the governor or legislature. But 10
states leave filling these roles up to the electorate.
</p>
<p>
Utility commissions are famous for being ignored by the public — until
there’s a rate increase. But if the U.S. is to have any chance of
cutting emissions in line with its global commitments, ensuring fossil
fuel communities aren’t left behind, or improving our resilience to
increasing heat waves, fires, and floods, these gatekeepers have to be
paid more attention — and held accountable.
</p>
<p>
Charles Hua, the founder of a new nonprofit called Powerlines that aims
to raise awareness about the importance of these regulators, told me his
group has found that over the last decade, about one in 10 voters in
states with utility commission elections skipped that part of the
ballot. “In many of these elections where the margins are only a couple
percent, the one in 10 that sit out are deciding the election,” he said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Apathy or ignorance about utility commissions isn’t unique
to states where commissioners are elected, but it’s not helped by the
fact that many of these states are deeply red, and the races aren’t much
of a competition. This year, although seats are opening up in eight
states, many of them are unlikely to see a change from the status quo.
</p>
<p>
In Alabama and Nebraska, three current commissioners are running for
re-election unopposed. There’s a clear frontrunner among the three
candidates vying for one open seat in Oklahoma: a former Republican
state lawmaker named Brian Bingman, who is endorsed by the governor and
has raised nearly $450,000, much of which was donated by energy PACs and
oil and gas company executives, according to state filings. He’s up
against a lesser-known Libertarian candidate who, as of the last
reporting period, had raised less than $2,000, and a 90-year-old
Democrat who has raised zero dollars and already run for and lost
commission races three times.
</p>
<p>
Whoever is elected to open seats in North and South Dakota will have a
say in approving the permits for a contentious carbon dioxide pipeline —
a project that has drawn opposition from both sides of the aisle and
could have raised the stakes for the elections — but environmental
advocates in those states told me they expected incumbent candidates to
win.
</p>
<p>
But there are three races that are being closely watched by climate and
clean energy advocates. In Louisiana, a swing voter on the commission is
stepping down, throwing into question recent momentum against
business-as-usual operations in the gas-heavy state. In Arizona and
Montana, the current commissions have been skeptical of, if not outright
hostile to supporting the development of the two states’ big untapped
solar and wind resources. In each state, however, momentum is building
behind candidates who could change that paradigm.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
“If you can unlock Montana’s renewable energy potential, you can help
the western part of the country decarbonize,” Anne Hedges, the director
of policy and legislative affairs at the Montana Environmental
Information Center told me. “This is a really important race.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s what’s at stake.
</p>
<h3>
Arizona
</h3>
<p>
During the two years since the last election for the Arizona Corporation
Commission, the confusing name of the body in Arizona that regulates
utilities, its four-to-one Republican majority has been on a tear
dismantling what little clean energy policy there was in the state. In
February, the group voted to scrap the state’s meager Renewable Energy
Standard, which was enacted in 2006 and required utilities to get 15% of
their energy from renewables by 2025, as well as energy efficiency
standards. According to Autumn Johnson, executive director of the
Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, the commission has been
more resistant to renewable energy than the utilities. She told me that
in a recent proceeding to plan for the closure of the Four Corners coal
plant in 2031, the commission tried to prevent the state’s biggest
utility from considering renewables paired with batteries as part of the
replacement mix.
</p>
<p>
Solar development has been obstructed at every level. The commission
quashed efforts to create a market for community solar, small-scale
photovoltaic installations that offer low-income customers and renters
access to low-cost clean energy. It adopted a community solar policy
that “had so many poison pills in it that it made it impossible for a
market to actually form,” said Johnson. “We should for sure have a
community solar market. I think it’s kind of crazy we wouldn’t do that
in the sunniest state in the country.” It also gummed up the economics
of rooftop solar by decreasing the amount homeowners get paid for
exporting solar to the grid and burdening them with fixed fees. Johnson
said the market is down 40%, and that “a whole bunch of companies are
going bankrupt” because of the commission’s policies.
</p>
<p>
Whoever lands on the commission come January will have a big opportunity
to change course. The renewable energy and efficiency standards have not
yet been fully repealed, and will see another vote early next year.
Johnson said the new commission will vote on rules for virtual power
plants, which could help get more distributed solar and batteries on the
grid. As in many states, Arizona utilities are anticipating large load
growth in the coming years and proposing a lot of new natural gas power
plant development to meet it — but the commission has a chance to get
them to consider alternatives.
</p>
<p>
The race is competitive, with three Democrats, two Green party
candidates, and three Republicans, including one incumbent, running to
fill three seats. During a
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2024/09/03/arizona-corporation-commission-debate-how-to-watch/75019858007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
debate</u></a>, the main split between the two major political parties
was over support for renewables. Five of them took public funding for
their campaigns through
<a href="https://www.azcleanelections.gov/run-for-office/how-clean-funding-works" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
state’s Clean Elections fund</u></a>, so they’re nearly all working with
the same amount of capital, which means there is little to help signal
who’s likely to come out on top. The AFL-CIO has endorsed the three
Democrats in the race, but Arizona has one of the lowest union densities
in the country. The state Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, has endorsed
the Republicans running, and one of them, Rachel Waldman, has been
endorsed by three current commissioners.
</p>
<p>
Voters can choose three candidates, and the three with the most votes
will be elected.
</p>
<h3>
Montana
</h3>
<p>
Montana also has three seats opening up on its five-member Public
Service Commission, but the elections there are divided by district, and
all eyes are on one of the races in particular. Elena Evans, a geologist
who works as the environmental health manager for Missoula County, is
running as an Independent to unseat Jennifer Fielder, a Republican
incumbent running for her second term. Evans has raised nearly $100,000
since she registered to run in April, while Fielder has raised less than
$10,000 since January.
</p>
<p>
The headline issue in the race is affordability. Last year, the
commission approved a 28% rate increase for Northwestern Energy, the
biggest utility in the state. Molly Bell, political director for Montana
Conservation Voters, told me regulators have been “asleep at the wheel.”
She said the commission has been “rubber stamping rate increases, not
asking questions about [our utilities’] resource plans, and really not
holding our energy companies accountable to making plans for the
future.”
</p>
<p>
Environmental advocates are also worried about Northwestern’s recent
decision to acquire a larger stake in the Colstrip power plant, a
coal-fired facility built in the 1970s and 80s. Northwestern called the
plant “a dependable bridge to a cleaner energy future,” but it will
require nearly $200 million in retrofits to comply with new federal air
pollution regulations, a cost that Northwestern is now
<a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2024/09/24/four-things-to-know-about-northwestern-energy-rate-hike-request/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trying
to recoup</u></a> from ratepayers with a new 26% rate increase.
</p>
<p>
Hedges, of the Montana Energy Information Center, told me the rate
increases aren’t just hurting customers — major manufacturers like REC
Silicon are leaving the state due to rising energy costs. She wants the
commission to force Northwestern to invest in building out the
transmission system so that more wind energy can get onto the grid. “We
have a ton of wind energy, we have developers who are just clamoring to
access that, but they can’t because we don’t have the transmission
system,” she said. “Northwestern has no desire to build out that
transmission system because that means competition for them. That’s why
our rates are so high.”
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Elena Evans isn’t campaigning on a platform of cutting down on fossil
fuels or expanding renewables; she’s mainly telling voters she wants to
bring costs down and increase transparency. But in interviews, she’s
talked about the importance of ensuring utilities are prepared for
climate impacts, criticized the sitting commission for being
anti-technology, and expressed an interest in solutions such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-grid-reconductoring" target="_self"><u>reconductoring
transmission lines</u></a> to increase their capacity and installing
batteries to make the grid more resilient against outages.
</p>
<p>
The commission is currently fully Republican, and switching out just one
of those seats will not bring change overnight. But Stephanie Chase, a
researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute, said that having even one
person to ask different questions and bring new information to the
public record can be meaningful. “Even if they don’t have the votes,
they still have a platform and ability to raise issues, which I think is
really important in states where climate hasn’t been at the forefront.”
</p>
<h3>
Louisiana
</h3>
<p>
Louisiana’s recent history proves the value of dissenting voices, even
if they don’t have decisive influence. The state’s historically
utility-friendly commission saw a big shakeup two years ago when Davante
Lewis, a young progressive candidate,
<a href="https://grist.org/article/in-louisiana-an-electoral-upset-could-mean-a-breakthrough-for-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dethroned
a Democratic incumbent</u></a> who had held his district’s seat for
nearly two decades. Close to 80% of Louisiana’s electricity comes from
natural gas, and Lewis campaigned on transitioning the state to
renewables, in addition to hardening the grid against storms and
lowering fees for customers. He has already made a few small inroads on
clean energy, such as advancing an energy efficiency program that had
been held up in negotiations with the utilities for more than a decade.
The commission also recently approved the
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/05/23/louisiana-approves-largest-renewable-expansion-in-state-history-00159454" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>biggest
expansion of renewable energy</u></a> in state history.
</p>
<p>
But Lewis is one of two Democrats on the commission, and has been helped
by a swing voter — a moderate Republican named Craig Greene — who’s
stepping down this year.
</p>
<p>
Three candidates are vying for Greene’s spot, but one — State Senator
Jean Paul Coussan — has a clear fundraising advantage. The big question
around the election seems to be less about who will win, and more about
what Coussan would do on the commission. In interviews with local media
outlets, he has said he wants to ensure the state can keep pace with
demand growth while keeping rates down. He’s expressed openness about
renewables but also emphasized the importance of the state’s “abundant
supply of natural gas.”
</p>
<p>
The clean energy advocates I spoke to weren’t sure what to make of him.
“You just can’t tell based on what Coussan’s saying now,” Daniel Tait,
who researches Southern utilities for the Energy and Policy Institute, a
consumer watchdog, told me. He said that of the two Republicans running,
Coussan seemed more willing to talk about clean energy and find common
ground. But it’s unclear how he will compare to the outgoing
commissioner.
</p>
<p>
Hua, of PowerLines, emphasized that whatever happens, it will have
ripple effects through the region. “What Louisiana does is an indicator,
in some ways, of what the rest of the Southeast can do,” he told me.
“And the Southeast is a particularly important region because that’s
where we’re seeing all this load growth, this gas build out, energy
burden and environmental injustice challenges. What the Southeast does
will make or break what the U.S. does in terms of the clean energy
transition.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Editor’s note: A previous version of this article misstated the
percentage of voters who skip utility commission elections. It also
misidentified the party of the incumbent whom Davante Lewis defeated.
Both mistakes have been fixed. We regret the errors.</em>

<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg1MzI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzY2NTA1MX0.KqTShFTxhIOwRjFsnOnSmEtefpe4sMVJEFCuju0JR54/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
An hour northwest of San Antonio, Texas, the small town of Bandera is
home to fewer than 1,000 people. Complete with old-timey heritage
buildings from the Old West, the town markets itself as a ranching
tourism destination and the “cowboy capital of the world.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
And some residents <em><em>really</em></em> don’t want the solar farm
coming to town: Pine Gate Renewables’
<a href="https://pinegaterenewables.com/rio-lago/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rio
Lago solar project</u></a>, which would produce 132 megawatts of power.
That’s enough renewable electricity to fuel almost 23,000 homes.
</p>
<p>
When the project first appeared on homeowners’ doorsteps, citizens
concerned about building anything at industrial scale in their bucolic
community
<a href="https://www.banderabulletin.com/article/news/school-board-unanimously-rejects-solar-farm-tax-abatement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rejected
a local tax abatement</u></a> and began speaking to local media.
Eventually, roughly a dozen people living near the proposed Rio Lago
site filed a lawsuit in state court seeking damages for alleged sediment
runoff, along with a laundry list of other complaints. The state court
judge was sympathetic to the individuals in Bandera, ordered
<a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/real-estate/article/bandera-solar-farm-pine-gate-lawsuit-order-18684108.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construction
to stop</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/real-estate/article/bandera-solar-farm-pine-gate-judge-sanctions-19393574.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sanctioned
Pine Gate</u></a> when
<a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/ksat-investigates/2024/02/24/landowners-claim-solar-company-is-breaking-court-order-to-halt-construction-of-bandera-solar-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>residents
said</u></a> the company appeared to continue work on the project. The
case is now pending in federal court.
</p>
<p>
Taken together this outcry, lawsuit, and
<a href="https://www.ksat.com/video/news/2024/01/09/bandera-landowners-push-for-court-intervention-on-solar-farm-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>all
of</u></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtmJCusIukI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
resulting</u></a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ78eQgod2Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>local
news coverage</u></a> coverage add up to a crucial test: Can a handful
of people block carbon-free power to so many homes?
</p>
<p>
In this circumstance, probably not. Last week, the federal judge now
overseeing the case – Richard Farrer, who was appointed under Trump in
2017 – told the aggrieved homeowners and their lawyer that while the
allegations of damages may still proceed to trial, there was “not
sufficient evidence of imminent irreparable harm to support” an order to
stop construction, according to a transcript of the hearing.
</p>
<p>
But still, this case still fascinates. That’s because despite Texas’
conservative political leaning the Lone Star state is a panacea for
renewables development. It produces 16% of the nation’s total renewable
energy but accounts for only 2.5% of the contested projects, restrictive
ordinances, and moratoriums in Heatmap Pro’s database. Part of the
reason Texas is so receptive is that energy production overall is pretty
welcome – when you’re so used to oil rigs, a solar farm isn’t that big
of a deal. For its part, Pine Gate clearly thinks it’s a great place to
build as the company claims to have forty projects at various stages in
the state.
</p>
<p>
The case of Bandera and the Rio Lago solar project ultimately
illustrates NIMBYism – historically
<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/nimbyism-isnt-a-conservative-or-winning-message/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>understood
as</u></a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/05/business/economy/california-housing-crisis-nimby.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
of</u></a>
<a href="https://www.curbed.com/2022/06/obama-aia-conference-housing-crisis-liberal-nimby-yimby.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
issue</u></a>
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159345/new-york-temporary-housing-eviction-nimby-rhetoric" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>amongst
liberals</u></a> – can occur in even the most staunchly conservative
parts of the country: the town is represented in Congress by Rep. Chip
Roy, who has a 96% lifetime score from the
<a href="https://heritageaction.com/scorecard/members/R000614" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Heritage
Foundation’s political arm</u></a> and a month ago called to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GREcEKI5aaI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fully
defund</u></a> the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, while renewable energy and decarbonization capital is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>pouring
into culturally red areas</u></a> across the U.S., this conflict
demonstrates how a backlash can really rear its ugly head.
</p>
<p>
Jennifer Rosenblatt, a lawyer representing the homeowners opposed to the
solar farm, told me her litigation isn’t “anti-solar” and “simply a
construction issue.” But she acknowledged the residents are motivated by
a simple and familiar adage: “Nobody wants it in their backyard.”
</p>
<p>
“All things being equal, they don’t want it there,” Rosenblatt said.
“Everybody wants to say it’s a lawsuit about ‘not in my backyard,’ but
in Texas you can’t control what somebody does on their property next
door. There’s no lawsuit about that.”
</p>
<p>
We’ll keep you updated on the status of this lawsuit in future editions
of The Fight.

<p>
<strong>1. Madison County, Ohio</strong> – All eyes are now on the Ohio
Supreme Court, after opponents of the nation’s largest agri-voltaics
project – Savion’s Oak Run solar farm – yesterday formally appealed a
key approval from the state Power Siting Board.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We’ve previously explored how the fight over Oak Run is a flashpoint for
solar on farmland. But perhaps even more important: it could decide the
threshold for rejecting renewables in Ohio towns and counties that don’t
want more projects.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Matt Eisenson at Columbia’s Sabin Center for Climate Law represents
landowners intervening in support of the project. The big legal question
in this appeal, he said, “is the extent to which public opinion and
opposition by local government officials can be viewed as a proxy for
the public interest.”
</li>
<li>
“[A]s a matter of law, one of the criteria for approval by the Ohio
Power Siting Board is whether a project will serve the public interest,
convenience, and necessity,” he explained in an email last night. “Can
the Siting Board conclude, on the basis of local opposition alone, that
a project does not serve the public interest?”
</li>
<li>
Eisenson said other legal challenges against other solar projects –
Lightsource bp’s Birch Solar and Vesper Energy’s Kingwood Solar – could
also decide this question. But crucially, Oak Run is the lone project of
the three that was approved by the siting board.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Nassau County, New York </strong>– RWE and National Grid
submitted the nation’s biggest offshore wind proposal to date to be
built in the New York Bight with interconnection points in Brooklyn and
Long Island …
</p>
<ul>
<li>
…and days later, the member of Congress representing the Long Island
connection point – Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito – came out against
offshore wind.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Ironically, D’Esposito is the top Republican on the congressional
offshore wind caucus.
</li>
<li>
“I was just asked the other day, <em><em>why don’t you support offshore
wind and certain battery storage?</em></em>” D’Esposito said at a debate
last week. “I don’t really see how building offshore wind farms and
giant battery storage facilities is going to stop flooding in low-lying
areas.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
If D’Esposito wins re-election, I expect him to become a Chris
Smith-like figure in New York and take up the cause opposing offshore
wind projects. It won’t matter for legislation – but as we’ve shown with
other project fights, field hearings and oversight letters can be
harmful to an individual project’s public perception.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Swift County, Minnesota </strong>– Rarely do we talk
pro-renewables decisions here in The Fight’s Hotspots… but that changes
today thanks to a rural Minnesota county <em><em>rejecting</em></em> a
moratorium.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
County commissioners
<a href="https://www.wctrib.com/news/local/for-second-time-minnesotas-swift-county-rejects-moratorium-on-wind-power" target="_blank"><u>blocked
a moratorium</u></a>, proposed by a petition signed by over 400 locals,
for the second time last week, according to local media outlet
<em><em>West Central Tribune</em></em>. If enacted, per the
<em><em>Tribune</em></em>, it would bar Apex Clean Energy from
constructing at least one utility scale solar farm in the western part
of the county that could generate up to 400 megawatts in carbon-free
power.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The commissioners have instead delegated the moratorium conversation to
a renewable energy-focused committee with no clear timetable to conclude
its work.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Fayette County, Pennsylvania </strong>– Another spot to watch
for an anti-solar and wind ordinance is this county where developers are
vying to stop restrictive property setback requirements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If adopted, solar projects would have to be built in areas zoned for
light or heavy industry and get special permits. They’d also have to be
300-600 feet from property lines and 1,200 feet from state roads.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Commissioners told the public and would-be solar developer Prospect 14
last week at a hearing it would study the legal and technical details of
the subject and vote on the proposal at a
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/proposed-fayette-county-solar-farm-legislation/" target="_blank"><u>later,
unspecified date</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
I’m not optimistic this county will side with the developers. The county
zoning commission just rejected a Susquehanna Solar project because it
was proposed
<a href="https://www.heraldstandard.com/editors_pick/2024/oct/18/fayette-commissioners-hold-a-public-hearing-on-solar-farm-ordinance/" target="_blank"><u>too
close to a school</u></a>. The county also swung hard for Donald Trump
in 2016, which Heatmap Pro’s data finds to be a flashing danger sign for
developers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>5. Carroll County, Maryland </strong>– Developers have released
the route for the Piedmont Reliability Project, a transmission proposal
that will connect to a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and will
criss-cross Maryland. Some of the power will feed to data centers in
Northern Virginia.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You can see
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ead641cb808140eea82ca58900c25ecb?fbclid=IwY2xjawF_RI5leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHTrDH5uPF5H5daHQCZKthqnQHA4yBs6Rrb9hv0KHX5VsWVAH1S3tilLnQg_aem_rCSQ_ktVGqG9oBQd7zWs8w" target="_blank"><u>a
map</u></a> of the transmission line route here. The line is necessary
to avoid blackouts from coal plant retirements, which is partially why
we included it on Heatmap’s list of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/risk-index" target="_self"><u>10 at-risk
projects</u></a> in the energy transition. (I would note state officials
have stated this project is not a part of their climate goals, likely
because some of the energy will feed data centers.)
</li>
<li>
Piedmont’s biggest hurdles are the same rural Maryland counties opposed
to solar and wind on farmland. Residents are
<a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/residents-continue-speak-out-proposed-power-line-project/62672763" target="_blank"><u>in
outcry mode</u></a>.
</li>
<li>
Public meetings on the proposal will be Nov. 12 in Baltimore County,
Nov. 13 in Carroll County, and Nov. 14 in Frederick County. <em><em>Dear
reader, should I go to one?</em></em>
</li>
</ul>

a solar project</a> on state endowment land – and of course, some
Republican politicians are <a href="http://v" target="_blank">grousing
about it</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span><strong>In Kentucky</strong>, only

<p>
<strong>1. Offshore wind completion </strong>– The Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-completes-environmental-review-wind-lease-areas-offshore-new-york-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">finished
its environmental review</a> for more offshore wind off the coast of New
York and New Jersey – an area relevant to the recently-submitted
Community Offshore Wind joint venture between RWE and National Grid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Five other projects have acreage within the lease area according to
BOEM: Bluepoint Wind, Atlantic Shores, Invenergy Wind, and Vineyard
Wind. BOEM’s website also lists an area held by Attentive Energy; it is
unclear how the company’s decision to pull out of the New York
solicitation will impact those parcels.
</li>
<li>
The lengthy programmatic environmental impact statement
(<a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/new-york-bight-final-programmatic-environmental-impact-statement" target="_blank"><u>viewed
here</u></a>) is a crucial step under the National Environmental Policy
Act before selling leases to developers.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. Offshore wind polling </strong>– On the heels of that
decision comes a noteworthy poll of New Jersey residents finding many
voters opposed to offshore wind don’t really care if politicians feel
the same way.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Stockton University
<a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2024/hughes-center-wind-poll-election.html" target="_blank"><u>poll
released Tuesday</u></a> found only 17% of voters said a candidate’s
views on offshore wind would influence their vote “a great deal.” Among
coastal voters – a group deeply opposed to offshore wind in the poll –
only about 30% of voters said a candidate’s view on the matter “would
impact their vote greatly.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
“No matter which side of the issue voters land on, they seem to agree
that it’s not a top priority,” said Alyssa Maurice, research director at
Stockton’s William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy, in a statement.
“The opposition to offshore wind is particularly vocal and
well-organized in New Jersey, but the poll shows that for most voters
this issue doesn’t move the needle much.”
</li>
<li>
What does this mean? Well when it comes to this issue deciding
elections, we’ll be holding our breath.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Geothermal permitting</strong> – The Bureau of Land
Management has
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-takes-major-steps-accelerate-clean-energy-geothermal" target="_blank">dropped
a new proposal</a> to streamline permitting for geothermal energy
projects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The proposed rule, which is now up for public comment, would create a
new “categorical exclusion” for geothermal resource confirmation plans –
a crucial step in the exploration process for potent geothermal energy.
It would allow drilling wells and core drilling to avoid a lengthy
review under the National Environmental Policy Act.<br/>
</li>
<li>
BLM
<a href="https://www.powermag.com/blm-approves-major-2-gw-geothermal-project-in-utah/" target="_blank"><u>also
approved</u></a> the Fervo Energy project in Utah, which will generate
upwards of 2 gigawatts of power.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em><em>Here’s what else we’re watching…</em></em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Energy Department </strong>has offered
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-montana-renewables-significantly-expand-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
conditional loan commitment</a> of up to $1.44 billion to a company
producing “sustainable” aviation fuel in Montana.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Michigan regulators </strong>have declared an anti-renewables
group
<a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2024/10/michigan-campaign-finance-violationoour-home-our-voices/" target="_blank">violated

<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
With the election approaching, I wanted to talk to the smartest person I
could find to explain how the election could affect the Inflation
Reduction Act and ultimately renewable energy development. So I hit up
Jason Clark, who was until recently chief strategy officer for American
Clean Power during passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the first
years of IRS guidance.
</p>
<p>
Clark, who has started energy policy consulting firm Power Brief, put
together a risk profile for every major IRA program in the event of
unified Republican control in Washington. I talked to him about the risk
analysis, what programs are most at risk, and whether we should care
about oil companies supporting some parts of the law.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why did you do this? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I spent the last six months traveling the world and during that time, I
was blissfully tuned out on politics. Now that I’m back in D.C., and
given how consequential this election is going to be – suffice it to
say, I’m tuned back in.
</p>
<p>
I was close to the IRA drafting process – I’m familiar with the
underlying bill and also how the government thinks about the programs. I
recently started a company, Power Brief, that marries my love for clean
energy policy and my old consulting habits: pretty visuals and
PowerPoints. And looking at what might happen to the IRA felt like THE
big thing happening in the space right now, so I wanted to dive deeper.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the content has been “will they/won’t they” analysis. How much
do Republicans feel strongly about this bill overall? How much passion
would Trump have for pushing for a full repeal? It’s been out there. But
this is so complicated and has so many moving parts. I wanted to try and
capture both the political reality for some of these programs and also
the very practical reality of how the government thinks about the
<em><em>cost</em></em> of these programs. The fact it can all be
contained in one visual is to help people who care about climate policy
and want to really understand what may happen depending on how the
election turns out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We know Congress is going to take a stab at a new tax bill next
year. I’ve written about how the
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u><strong>IRA
would be targeted</strong></u></a><strong> in that situation. Can you
help our readers understand why these programs would be vulnerable in
tax talks? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Classic partisan politics in D.C. By the nature of using reconciliation,
the IRA was ultimately purely Democratic-led and that automatically
paints it with a certain color. I think that [former] President Trump
has been very unshy about criticizing the IRA, and when he doesn’t use
the IRA moniker, he uses different monikers thereof. And people are
going to be looking for the easiest path [to money to extend the
Trump-era tax cuts].
</p>
<p>
What I don’t think is that it’ll be thrown out entirely. We’ve seen
members of the House and Senate express support for parts of it–
</p>
<p>
<strong>Republicans? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Correct. There was
<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
letter</u></a> from 18 House Republicans to the [House] Speaker [Mike
Johnson] saying we shouldn’t just throw this out, we should really look
at it. And I think that there’s a lot of people who look at where the
investment from the IRA is flowing – a lot of the dollars are going to
Republican-controlled states and districts. Yes, that may insulate the
whole bill from repeal outright but a lot of that is announced
investment but hasn’t turned into steel on the ground and jobs yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So your chart singles out EV tax credits as most vulnerable to
repeal. Why? </strong>
</p>
<p>
The universe of electric vehicle tax credits is fully at risk. We’ve
seen it from Republican voters – constituents! – who feel that EVs are
just some type of government mandated, <em><em>this is some car you have
to buy.</em></em> But it also happens to be very, very expensive. When
the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT} crunches the numbers about what
this is going to cost between now and 10 years from now, it’s one of the
most expensive portions of the legislation. So when you look at it and
ask how much is it going to cost to ax this and give us the most savings
in the tax code? You get this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The IRA didn’t create these credits though. It simply expanded
them. You think the entire credit could go away in a Republican
trifecta? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the entire EV tax credit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay. So next up on the chopping block per your chart is the
renewable energy investment tax credit, or ITC. Why? </strong>
</p>
<p>
“Both the ITC and the PTC [production tax credit] when they shift into
this new tech neutral paradigm have the same risk profile. For these, I
don’t think it’s necessarily going to be a full repeal. I think the data
about how much money is going into Republican districts is legitimate,
and I think it will materialize. But there’s many spectrums of levers
that someone can pull.
</p>
<p>
The tech neutral credit doesn’t end on a certain calendar year date. It
ends when the U.S. sector hits a certain emissions target. The credit
continues until that moment in time. One way to make the credit look
less expensive on paper is to say, <em><em>no, we are going to end it at
a certain point</em></em>. Take 2030 or 2032. You could codify a
timeline on it, so the JCT won’t score the out-years on how expensive
the credit is going to be. That is one version of it.
</p>
<p>
Another version of it is that there’s a base credit and then there’s
added layers, like wage requirements or low-income area benefits. And
that’s another thing you could pull to say,<em><em> look, we’re not
going to do that anymore. </em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What would be the impact on developers? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think a lot of folks appreciate just how long range some of this
planning is, how long it takes to permit something, how long it takes to
figure out the interconnection queue.
</p>
<p>
Companies aren’t thinking <em><em>what are we going to build this
year</em></em> – they’re thinking <em><em>what will be put online in
2035</em></em>. So if the government changes the stability of that,
companies start to pull back and say <em><em>hey, let’s not go too crazy
in the outyears</em></em>. Baseline? It means fewer clean energy
projects come online. The industry has been banking on a certain level
of certainty to plan against. Any shockwave against that and some
companies are going to look and ask if they have the assurance to move
forward with this or not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Okay well, candidly, to that I say: woof. So okay, your chart
labels the PTC and energy efficiency credits as vulnerable. Why are they
at risk if they cost less than other programs? </strong>
</p>
<p>
There are going to be certain things where the dollars and cents lose
out to the political policy realities. On energy efficiency, it would be
easy to make that whole category a continuation over the fight on gas
stoves or heat pumps and frame them as tax credits for wealthy people to
do expensive stuff on their homes, costing the rest of the country. I
don’t think it’s as much of a kitchen table conversation per se but it’s
up there. Even if it doesn’t save them that much money, it does face the
risk of being that low-hanging fruit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Well, alrighty then. What about 45X? That’s pretty crucial to
many manufacturers out there today. </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think both Democrats and Republicans can stand behind more domestic
manufacturing coming to the United States. That’s something that is a
bipartisan consensus and reducing that, harming that, will pose a
liability for politicians. Now similarly, you could shorten the window
and amounts, but at the end of the day, it’s a lot more politically
resilient despite being seen as the most expensive part of what was
included in the IRA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You ranked about half of the IRA’s programs – hydrogen, carbon
capture, sustainable aviation fuels, and more – as being both low cost
and at low risk for repeal. Why? </strong>
</p>
<p>
What they benefit from is a greater resonance with Republican
policymakers. Carbon capture and sequestration, sustainable aviation
fuels and biofuels, hydrogen – all of these things get more of a shrug
with Republicans when you talk to them. And that is why you see major
oil and gas groups come out and say, hey, let’s not repeal the whole
IRA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>But repealing the programs at risk while keeping these other
programs… how would that outcome impact the pace of decarbonization?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Drastically. It would effectively remove the economic premise for all
future renewable energy generation. It gets rid of a key driver of the
shift toward electric vehicles. I think if you repealed everything in
the red, then I think what you’ve done is you’ve gotten rid of all the
reasons capital is pouring money into renewable energy projects and
storage right now. In that scenario you’d see a drastic slowdown in
climate ambitions in the electric power sector and also the EV
transition that’s been happening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So… the oil companies telling Trump to keep some of the IRA is a
cold comfort, then? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowing it doesn’t go away fully is a cold comfort looking at this risk
analysis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What did this exercise teach you about the IRA? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think that a lot of the net benefit of the decarbonization that
translates to jobs and economic development is really, really close, and
a lot of what is in the IRA would be lower risk if more of that had been
pushed through faster. I think implementation and the natural barriers
of the lack of transmission, siting and permitting challenges… There’s a
confluence of things that make it hard to quickly double the size of the
sector but a lot of stuff is coming. But there’s capital behind it,
plans behind it, and I think they’re going to build a lot more. As they
do that, the sentiment is going to change behind it, but we have to get
to that promised land first.

id="trump-wanted-generals-like-hitlers-says-ex-white-house-chief-of-staff">Trump
wanted generals like Hitler’s, says ex-White House chief of staff</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff is warning
that the Republican presidential nominee meets the definition of a
fascist and that while in office, Trump suggested that Nazi leader Adolf
Hitler “did some good things.” </p>
<p>The comments from John Kelly, the retired Marine general who worked
for Trump in the White House from 2017 to 2019, came in interviews
published Tuesday in The New York Times and The Atlantic. They build on
past warnings from former top Trump officials as the election enters its
final two weeks. </p>
<p>Kelly has long been critical of Trump and previously accused him of
calling veterans killed in combat “suckers” and “losers.” His new
warnings emerged as Trump seeks a second term vowing to dramatically
expand his use of the military at home and suggesting he would use force
to go after Americans he considers “enemies from within.” </p>
<p>“He commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good
things, too,’” Kelly recalled to the Times. Kelly said he would usually
quash the conversation by saying “nothing (Hitler) did, you could argue,
was good,” but that Trump would occasionally bring up the topic
again. </p>
<p>In his interview with the Atlantic, Kelly recalled that when Trump
raised the idea of needing “German generals,” Kelly would ask if he
meant “Bismarck’s generals,” referring to Otto von Bismarck, the
chancellor who oversaw the unification of Germany. “Surely you can’t
mean Hitler’s generals,” Kelly recalled asking Trump. To which the
former president responded, “Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.” </p>
<p>Trump’s campaign denied the accounts Tuesday, with campaign spokesman
Steven Cheung saying that Kelly had “beclowned himself with these
debunked stories he has fabricated.” </p>
<p>Polls show the race is tight in swing states, and both Trump and Vice
President Kamala Harris are crisscrossing the country making their final
pitches to the sliver of undecided voters. Harris’ campaign has spent
considerable time reaching out to independent voters, using the support
of longtime Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney and comments like
Kelly’s to urge past Trump voters to reject his candidacy in
November. </p>
<p>Harris’ campaign held a call with reporters Tuesday to elevate the
voices of retired military officials who highlighted how many of the
officials who worked with Trump now oppose his campaign. </p>
<p>“People that know him best are most opposed to him, his presidency,”
said retired Army Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson. </p>
<p>Anderson said he wished Kelly would fully back Harris over Trump,
something he has yet to do. But retired Army reserve Col. Kevin Carroll,
a former senior counselor to Kelly, said Wednesday that the former top
Trump official would “rather chew broken glass than vote for Donald
Trump.” </p>
<p>Before serving as Trump’s chief of staff, Kelly worked as the former
president’s secretary of homeland security, where he oversaw Trump’s
attempts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly was also at
the forefront of the Trump administration’s crackdown in immigration
policy that led to the separation of thousands of immigrant parents and
their children along the southern border. Those actions made him a
villain to many on the left, including Harris. </p>
<p>Kelly is not the first former top Trump administration official to
cast the former president as a threat. </p>
<p>Retired Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, who served as Trump’s chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bob Woodward in his recent book “War”
that Trump was “fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to
this country.” And retired Gen. Jim Mattis, who worked as secretary of
defense under Trump, reportedly later told Woodward that he agreed with
Milley’s assessment. </p>
<p>Throughout Trump’s political rise, the businessman-turned-politician
benefited from the support of military veterans. </p>
<p>AP VoteCast found that about 6 in 10 military veterans said they
voted for Trump in 2020, as did just over half of those with a veteran
in the household. Among voters in this year’s South Carolina Republican
primary, AP VoteCast found that close to two-thirds of military veterans
and people in veteran households voted for Trump over former South
Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s toughest opponent in the 2024
Republican primary.</p>

id="border-arrests-fall-in-september-last-monthly-gauge-before-us-elections">Border
arrests fall in September, last monthly gauge before US elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Diego — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico
fell 7% in September to a more than four-year low, authorities said
Tuesday. It was likely the last monthly gauge during a presidential
campaign in which Republican nominee Donald Trump has made immigration a
signature issue. </p>
<p>The Border Patrol made 53,858 arrests, down from 58,009 in August and
the lowest tally since August 2020, when arrests totaled 47,283,
according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. </p>
<p>Mexicans accounted for nearly half of the arrests, becoming a greater
part of the mix. In December, when arrests reached an all-time high of
250,000, Mexicans made up fewer than 1 in 4. Arrests for other major
nationalities seen at the border, including Guatemalans, Hondurans,
Colombians and Ecuadoreans, have plunged this year. </p>
<p>San Diego was again the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in
September, followed by El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona. </p>
<p>For the government’s fiscal year that ended on September 30, the
Border Patrol made 1.53 million arrests after topping 2 million in each
of the previous two years for the first time. </p>
<p>The White House touted the numbers as proof that severe asylum
restrictions introduced in June were having the intended effect, and
blamed congressional Republicans for opposing a border security bill
that failed in February. Vice President Kamala Harris has used that line
of attack against Trump to try to blunt criticism that the Biden
administration has been weak on immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>“The Biden Harris administration has taken effective action, and
Republican officials continue to do nothing,” said White House spokesman
Angelo Fernández Hernández. </p>
<p>The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a frequent
administration critic and advocate for immigration restrictions,
attributed recent declines to more enforcement by Mexican officials
within their own borders, saying the White House “essentially outsourced
U.S. border security to Mexico in advance of the 2024 election —
policies that can be reversed at any time that the government of Mexico
chooses.” </p>
<p>Arrests fell sharply after Mexico increased enforcement in December,
and took a steeper dive after the U.S. asylum restrictions took effect
in June. U.S. officials have not been shy about highlighting Mexico’s
role. </p>
<p>Mexican authorities are encountering more migrants this year while
deportations remain relatively low, creating a bottleneck. Panamanian
authorities reported an increase in migrants walking through the
notorious Darien Gap during September, though numbers are still well
below last year. </p>
<p>Troy Miller, acting CBP commissioner, said last week that the
administration is working with Mexico and other countries to jointly
address migration. </p>
<p>“We continue to be concerned about any bottlenecks, we continue to
look at those, we continue to address them with our partners,” Miller
said at a news conference in San Diego. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has promoted new and expanded legal pathways
to enter the country in an effort to discourage illegal crossings. In
September, CBP allowed more than 44,600 people to enter with
appointments on an online system called CBP One, bringing the total to
852,000 since it was introduced in January 2023. </p>
<p>Another Biden policy allows up to 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti,
Nicaragua and Venezuela with financial sponsors to enter monthly through
airports. More than 531,000 people from those four countries have
entered that way up through September.</p>

id="fernando-valenzuela-mexican-born-pitcher-whose-feats-for-dodgers-fueled-fernandomania-dies-at-63">Fernando
Valenzuela, Mexican-born pitcher whose feats for Dodgers fueled
‘Fernandomania,’ dies at 63</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican-born phenom for the
Los Angeles Dodgers who inspired “Fernandomania” while winning the NL Cy
Young Award and Rookie of the Year in 1981, has died. He was 63. </p>
<p>The team said he died Tuesday night at a Los Angeles hospital but did
not provide the cause or other details. </p>
<p>His death comes as the Dodgers prepare to open the World Series on
Friday night at home against the New York Yankees. Baseball Commissioner
Rob Manfred said Valenzuela would be honored during the series at Dodger
Stadium. </p>
<p>Valenzuela left his color commentator job on the Dodgers’
Spanish-language television broadcast in September without explanation.
He was reported to have been hospitalized earlier this month. His job
kept him as a regular at Dodger Stadium, where he held court in the
press box dining room before games and remained popular with fans who
sought him out for photos and autographs. </p>
<p>“God bless Fernando Valenzuela!” actor and Dodgers fan Danny Trejo
posted on X. </p>
<p>Valenzuela was one of the most dominant players of his era and a
wildly popular figure in the 1980s, although he was never elected to the
Baseball Hall of Fame. However, he is part of Cooperstown, which
features several artifacts including a signed ball from his no-hitter in
1990. </p>
<p>“He is one of the most influential Dodgers ever and belongs on the
Mount Rushmore of franchise heroes,” Stan Kasten, team president and
CEO, said in a statement. “He galvanized the fan base with the
Fernandomania season of 1981 and has remained close to our hearts ever
since, not only as a player but also as a broadcaster. He has left us
all too soon.” </p>
<p>Valenzuela’s rise from humble beginnings as the youngest of 12
children in Mexico and his feats on the mound made him hugely popular
and influential in Los Angeles’ Latino community while helping attract
new fans to Major League Baseball. Their fondness for him continued
after his retirement. </p>
<p>“63 is way too young…. A piece of my childhood is gone,” actor and
Access Hollywood co-host Mario Lopez posted on X. “Growing up as a
Mexican kid one of the main reasons I’m a Dodgers fan is because of
Fernando. … Not only a great player, but a great man to the community.
What a legend.” </p>
<p>Eva Torres, who is originally from Mexico City, drove from Anaheim to
look at murals of Valenzuela on Sunset Boulevard near Dodgers
Stadium. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t a fan of baseball, but I am a fan of his,” she said. “He’s
like me: an immigrant that came here to do great things.” </p>
<p>In 1981, Valenzuela became the Dodgers’ opening day starter as a
rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his scheduled
start. He shut out the Houston Astros 2-0 and began the season 8-0 with
five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. He became the first player to win a Cy
Young and Rookie of the Year in the same season. </p>
<p>His performances created the delirium known as “Fernandomania” among
Dodgers fans. The ABBA hit Fernando would play as he warmed up on the
mound. </p>
<p>“Fernando Valenzuela was a true icon of the Dodgers and the game,”
U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California posted on X. “His legacy and
connection with the Latino community in LA is one of the reasons I fell
in love with the Dodgers.” </p>
<p>Valenzuela was 13-7 and had a 2.48 ERA in his first season, which was
shortened by a players’ strike. </p>
<p>He was an All-Star selection every year from 1981-86, when he
recorded 97 victories, 84 complete games, 1,258 strikeouts and a 2.97
ERA. He was 5-1 with a 2.00 ERA in eight postseason starts. He earned
two Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove. </p>
<p>Valenzuela’s no-hitter on June 29, 1990, a 6-0 victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals, was an emotional career highlight. He struck out
seven and walked three. </p>
<p>“If you have a sombrero, throw it to the sky!” Hall of Fame
broadcaster Vin Scully exclaimed in his game call. </p>
<p>Nicknamed “El Toro” by the fans, Valenzuela had an unorthodox and
memorable pitching motion that included looking skyward at the apex of
each windup. His repertoire included a screwball — making him one of the
few pitchers of his era who threw that pitch regularly. It was taught to
him by teammate Bobby Castillo after the Dodgers felt Valenzuela, who
wasn’t known as a hard thrower, needed another pitch. </p>
<p>Early in his Dodgers career, Valenzuela spoke little English and had
trouble communicating with his catchers. Rookie Mike Scioscia learned
Spanish and became Valenzuela’s personal catcher before becoming the
team’s full-time catcher. </p>
<p>Valenzuela was a better-than-average hitter, with 10 career home
runs. </p>
<p>Eventually, his pitching was compromised by nagging shoulder problems
that kept him out of the 1988 postseason, when the Dodgers won the World
Series. </p>
<p>The team released Valenzuela just before the 1991 season. He also
pitched for the former California Angels, Baltimore Orioles,
Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals. </p>
<p>He retired in 1997, going 173-153 with a 3.54 ERA in 17 seasons, the
all-time major league leader in wins and strikeouts (2,074) by a
Mexican-born player. In 11 seasons with the Dodgers, he was 141-116 with
a 3.31 ERA. </p>
<p>After retiring from MLB, Valenzuela remained active in Mexico’s
winter league. He played for the Aguilas de Mexicali in the Pacific
League until he was 44. He retired on Dec. 20, 2006. </p>
<p>“We regret the passing of a Mexican baseball legend, his legacy will
remain forever in our league and in the heart of our fans,” the league
said in a statement. </p>
<p>The baseball summer league as well other sports entities in Mexico,
including the Mexican Soccer Federation and the National Sports
Commission, also mourned his death. </p>
<p>“I think we, all Mexicans, are sad for the Valenzuela loss, and we
express our solidarity with his family,” new Mexican President Claudia
Sheinbaum said at her daily news conference. </p>
<p>Valenzuela is not only considered Mexico’s greatest baseball player,
but he also is widely considered one of its top three athletes of all
time, along with soccer player Hugo Sanchez and boxer Julio Cesar
Chavez. </p>
<p>“It’s a sad night. The news has shocked me, my soul and my spirit,
it’s a tremendous loss,” said Sanchez, now a sports analyst for ESPN.
“He was a symbol for Mexican sports during a historic moment.” </p>
<p>Valenzuela’s rise from his tiny hometown of Etchohuaquila in the
Mexican state of Sonora to stardom in the U.S. was improbable. He was
the youngest child in a large family who tagged along when his older
brothers played baseball. </p>
<p>He signed his first pro contract at age 16, and soon began
overpowering older players in the Mexican Central League. </p>
<p>In 1978, legendary Dodgers scout Mike Brito was in Mexico to watch a
shortstop when Valenzuela entered the game as a reliever. He immediately
commanded Brito’s attention and at age 18, Valenzuela signed with the
Dodgers in 1979. He was sent to the California League that same
year. </p>
<p>In 1980, Valenzuela was called up to the Dodgers in September and
soon made his big league debut as a reliever. </p>
<p>He remains the only pitcher in MLB history to win the Cy Young and
Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The left-hander was the
National League’s starting pitcher in the All-Star Game in 1981, the
same year the Dodgers won the World Series. </p>
<p>During his career, he made the cover of Sports Illustrated and
visited the White House. </p>
<p>In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers as the Spanish-language
radio color commentator for NL games. Twelve years later, he switched to
the color commentator job on the team’s Spanish-language TV feed. </p>
<p>“He consistently supported the growth of the game through the World
Baseball Classic and at MLB events across his home country,” Manfred
said in a statement. “As a member of the Dodger broadcasting team for
more than 20 years, Fernando helped to reach a new generation of fans
and cultivate their love of the game. Fernando will always remain a
beloved figure in Dodger history and a special source of pride for the
millions of Latino fans he inspired.” </p>
<p>He was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame
in 2014. Five years later, the Mexican League retired Valenzuela’s
No. 34 jersey. The Dodgers followed in 2023 after keeping his number out
of circulation since he last pitched for the team in 1991. The team has
a rule that requires a player to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame before
the Dodgers retire his number, but they made an exception for
Valenzuela. </p>
<p>The Dodgers named Valenzuela as part of the “Legends of Dodger
Baseball” in 2019 and inducted him into the team’s Ring of Honor in
2023. </p>
<p>He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. </p>
<p>Valenzuela served on the coaching staff for Mexico during the World
Baseball Classic in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2017. He was a part-owner of
the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo, with son Fernando
Jr. serving as team president and son Ricky serving as general manager.
Fernando Jr. played in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox
organizations as a first baseman. </p>
<p>“To talk about Mexican baseball is to talk about Fernando Valenzuela.
Thank you for putting Mexico’s name high,” Baseball’s National Teams
Committee said on X. “We join the Valenzuela Burgos family in their
sorrow.” </p>
<p>In addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife, Linda, who was a
schoolteacher from Mexico whom he married in 1981, and daughters Linda
and Maria as well as seven grandchildren.</p>

for Harris another milestone in former President Jimmy Carter’s
legacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Plains, Ga. — In a cavernous store filled with trinkets and
knick-knacks, Philip Kurland is surrounded by politics.</p>
<p>“We’re the largest political memorabilia dealer in the United
States,” he tells VOA as he sorts through numerous bins that line his
shop.</p>
<p>If there’s a button or badge supporting a political candidate,
chances are Kurland has it, as he stops and inspects one button in
particular.</p>
<p>“This is the number one button people request and come in for,” as he
proudly shows an image of a smiling peanut shell.</p>
<p>Every four years, Kurland stocks up on items featuring the candidates
of the moment, and gauges support by the volume of related memorabilia
he sells.</p>
<p>“Our sales have always equaled to who has won,” said Kurland. “This
year’s election is really hard to even say by my sales.”</p>
<p>His store isn’t just any ordinary shop in the country. It’s the
Plains Trading Post … as in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter with a population of around 600 people, where the
streets are lined with dueling signs from the current election
supporting both Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“For the first time ever, I’d say there was some tension over the
upcoming election,” Kurland told VOA.</p>
<p>In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Sumter County which encompasses
Plains, and narrowly won the state of Georgia by 11,779 votes out of
more than 5 million cast.</p>
<p>“It’s shocking that we’re a battleground state now,” said Kurland,
acknowledging that polls continue to show a close race in Georgia this
election cycle where both campaigns recognize every vote counts,
including a prominent one cast by mail-in ballot from the most famous
resident of Plains.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’d miss any opportunity to vote,” said Kurland, “I
can remember one time when they passed a new law in the state that you
had to show an ID, and he went to vote and didn’t have an ID, and they
said, ‘you can’t vote.’</p>
<p>And he said, ‘I’m the president of the United States!’ and they said,
‘well, we’re sorry,’ and he had to go home and get an ID to vote, which
I thought was hilarious.”</p>
<p>“He was excited to turn 100, but he’s more excited to cast his ballot
for Vice President Harris,” Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson,
explained to VOA during a recent interview.</p>
<p>Jason Carter currently serves as chairman of the board of the former
president’s global nonprofit Carter Center.</p>
<p>“It would be an incredible story, at the end of his 100-year life,
that is continuing on as we know, to have grown up in the segregated
south and for one of his last political acts is to help elect a Black
woman who is a president, I do think it would be important,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter has already said it was important for him to vote for
Barack Obama in 2008,” said Joe Crespino, a professor of history at
Emory University.</p>
<p>Crespino believes Carter’s vote this year is directly connected to
his legacy, specifically his efforts to get the Equal Rights Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, or ERA — which prohibits sex discrimination —
ratified by some U.S. states while he was president in the 1970s.</p>
<p>“Voting for the first female candidate of color would be important
for him not only because of his experiences with race over the course of
his life but also his experiences in trying to advance women in public
life,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 40 years after Carter served in the White House, the ERA is
still an unsettled issue as legal debates over its ratification
continue.</p>
<p>Jason Carter believes with a vote in the 2024 election, his
grandfather is thinking as much about the future as he is the past.</p>
<p>“I think he wants to see this country brought back together,” said
Carter. “I think he wants to reduce that polarization; I think he wants
us to focus on what makes us Americans first and fundamentally, and I
think he thinks she [Harris] can do that.”</p>
<p>Kurland said not everyone in Plains agrees with Jimmy Carter, or his
candidate of choice, as he sees not just the tourists but some of the
locals stopping in to pick up memorabilia.</p>
<p>“Some days you can’t get eight people to say the sun is shining at
the same time,” he said.</p>
<p>But Kurland admits everyone in Plains honors the man who continues to
draw tens of thousands of tourists to their small town each year.</p>
<p>“Even though he’s come out for Kamala Harris, everyone that’s not for
her would instantly forgive him and still love him,” Kurland said.</p>
<p>As election day nears, Jimmy Carter continues to receive hospice care
in his modest home in Plains on the edge of town, not far from the
Depression-era boyhood farm where his story began 100 years ago.</p>

study</a> released in <em>Nature</em> finds that these actions could
actually be an effective means of increasing support for more moderate
climate organizations. <br/> <br/> The study’s authors conducted a
survey of over 1,400 UK residents before and after the activist group
Just Stop Oil shut down traffic on a major highway, which ultimately led
to a 3.3% increase in support for the supposedly more moderate
environmental group Friends of the Earth. This is likely due to the
“radical flank effect,” in which a movement’s fringe boosts support for
more mainstream activists by making them seem more reasonable in
comparison. One of the study’s authors, Markus Ostarek,

that</a> though the boost in support was modest, the study indicates
that moderate groups could “use these moments of high momentum to
directly negotiate with policymakers.”

id="boeing-reports-6-billion-quarterly-loss-ahead-of-vote-by-union-workers-who-have-crippled-production">Boeing
reports $6 billion quarterly loss ahead of vote by union workers who
have crippled production</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EVERETT, Wash. — Boeing reported a loss of more than $6 billion in
the third quarter and immediately turned its attention to union workers
who will vote Wednesday whether to accept a company contract offer or
continue their crippling strike, which has dragged on for nearly six
weeks.  </p>
<p>New CEO Kelly Ortberg laid out his plan to turn Boeing around after
years of heavy losses and damage to its reputation.  </p>
<p>In remarks he planned to deliver later Wednesday to investors,
Ortberg said Boeing needs “a fundamental culture change in the company.”
To accomplish that, he said, company leaders need to spend more time on
factory floors to know what is going on and “prevent the festering of
issues and work better together to identify, fix, and understand root
cause.”  </p>
<p>Ortberg repeated that he wants to “reset” management’s relationship
with labor “so we don’t become so disconnected in the future.” He
expressed hope that machinists will vote to approve the company’s latest
contract offer and end their strike.  </p>
<p>“It will take time to return Boeing to its former legacy, but with
the right focus and culture, we can be an iconic company and aerospace
leader once again,” he said.  </p>
<p>The strike is an early test for Ortberg, a Boeing outsider who became
CEO in August.  </p>
<p>Ortberg has already announced large-scale layoffs and a plan to raise
enough cash to avoid a bankruptcy filing. He needs to convince federal
regulators that Boeing is fixing its safety culture and is ready to
boost production of the 737 Max — a crucial step to bring in much-needed
cash.  </p>
<p>Boeing can’t produce any new 737s, however, until it ends the strike
by 33,000 machinists that has shut down assembly plants in the Seattle
area.  </p>
<p>Ortberg has “got a lot on his plate, but he probably is laser-focused
on getting this negotiation completed. That’s the closest alligator to
the boat,” said Tony Bancroft, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, a
Boeing investor.  </p>
<p>Boeing hasn’t had a profitable year since 2018, and the situation is
about to get worse before it gets better.  </p>
<p>Boeing said Wednesday that it lost $6.17 billion in the period ended
Sept. 30, with an adjusted loss of $10.44 per share. Analysts polled by
Zacks Investment Research were calling for a loss of $10.34 per share.
 </p>
<p>Revenue totaled $17.84 billion, matching Wall Street estimates.  </p>
<p>Shares were flat before the opening bell.  </p>
<p>Investors will be looking for Ortberg to project calm, determination
and urgency as he presides over an earnings call for the first time
since he ran Rockwell Collins, a maker of avionics and flight controls
for airline and military planes, in the last decade.  </p>
<p>The biggest news of the day, however, is likely to come Wednesday
evening, when the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers reveals whether striking workers are ready to go back to their
jobs.  </p>
<p>They will vote at union halls in the Seattle area and elsewhere on a
Boeing offer that includes pay raises of 35% over four years, $7,000
ratification bonuses, and the retention of performance bonuses that
Boeing wanted to eliminate.  </p>
<p>Boeing has held firm in resisting a union demand to restore the
traditional pension plan that was frozen a decade ago. However, older
workers would get a slight increase in their monthly pension payouts.
 </p>
<p>At a picket line outside Boeing’s factory in Everett, Washington,
some machinists encouraged colleagues to vote no.  </p>
<p>“The pension should have been the top priority. We all said that was
our top priority, along with wage,” said Larry Best, a customer-quality
coordinator with 38 years at Boeing. “Now is the prime opportunity in a
prime time to get our pension back, and we all need to stay out and dig
our heels in.”  </p>
<p>Best also thinks the pay increase should be 40% over three years to
offset a long stretch of stagnant wages, now combined with high
inflation.  </p>
<p>“You can see we got a great turnout today. I’m pretty sure that they
don’t like the contract because that’s why I’m here,” said another
picketer, Bartley Stokes Sr., who started working at Boeing in 1978.
“We’re out here in force, and we’re going to show our solidarity and
stick with our union brothers and sisters and vote this thing down
because they can do better.”</p>

Over the past two months, the country’s biggest tech companies have
announced a flurry of deals with advanced and conventional nuclear

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>There’s a set of conflicting facts, or
slightly contradicting pieces of analysis about this that I believe can
all be accommodated together, but I’m still trying to understand how
they all fit together. Which is at this point, when we look at the
sources of power demand growth in the U.S., as we’ve covered on Shift
Key, demand for electricity in the U. S. is rising now for the first
time in 20 years. It’s a big deal.<br/> <br/> When you look at where
that demand growth is coming from, very little of it — or not a ton of
it — is actually coming from data centers. It’s coming from EVs, it’s
coming from new factories, it’s coming from electrification, it’s coming
from air conditioning, it’s coming from all these more typical sources
of demand growth in the economy — lots of places, by the way, where we
want demand to grow. Because part of how we’re going to transition is
that we’re going to move people from combusting fossil fuels to using
electricity. <br/> <br/> The IEA also just said in a report — it’s big
global wrap of energy — last week that it was not very concerned about
data centers for AI driving energy scarcity because data centers
ultimately are only going to use, even in a high-growth situation,
they’ll only use as much electricity as desalination plants. And, yeah,
these tech companies are acting as if … Microsoft is seemingly acting as
if it’s ready to pay between four and five times the market cost for
electricity for the next 20 years because of how much it anticipates its
power needs going up. <br/> <br/> So on the one hand, data centers are
not driving electricity demand growth. On the other hand, they do seem
to be driving this new set of deals. How do we work that out? <br/>
<br/> <strong>Josh Freed: </strong>Yeah, look, I think the first thing:
My approach to all of these issues is the reality — having worked in the
energy and climate space since 2009 — is that it is a very humbling
sector. And whatever assumptions we’re operating under today are going
to be proven wildly wrong in a year or two or five years. So the
simplest answer is, we just don’t know. And I think that companies like
Microsoft and Google and Amazon are looking at the potential need for a
significant amount of clean, firm electricity in specific parts of the
grid, and saying, <em>Let’s get ahead of this and ensure that as we’re
planning, we have clean electricity in the right places, built at
roughly the timeframe we expect need to escalate significantly</em>, so
that we have certainty for planning purposes.<br/> <br/> And in some
cases there’s, I think, also the expectation that there is enough
electricity demand growth, both domestically and in other advanced or
rapidly modernizing economies, that being a partner with an advanced
nuclear company or another company that is going to be able to provide a
lot more electricity is a win-win for them.

id="lebron-bronny-james-make-nba-history-with-father-son-appearance">LeBron,
Bronny James make NBA history with father-son appearance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — LeBron and Bronny James made NBA history on Tuesday,
becoming the first father-and-son duo to play alongside each other in a
regular season fixture as the Los Angeles Lakers opened their campaign
against the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>
<p>The duo, who played together briefly in a pre-season game earlier
this month, took to the court together late in the second quarter at the
Crypto.com Arena with the Lakers leading 51-35.</p>
<p>An enormous roar went up from the home crowd as the James duo were
brought onto the court by coach J.J. Redick after the Lakers had surged
into a double-digit lead.</p>
<p>In a perfectly scripted moment that was pure Hollywood, the James’
double-act was watched at courtside by Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey
Jr, who made baseball history playing for the Seattle Mariners as father
and son in 1990-1991.</p>
<p>“We made history; now we get to watch history,” said Griffey Jr., who
joined his father to pose for photos with LeBron and Bronny James
shortly before Tuesday’s tip-off.</p>
<p>Lakers officials had been coy before Tuesday’s season-opener about
where and when LeBron James and Bronny would play their first regular
season fixture together.</p>
<p>However, NBA superstar LeBron James, who turns 40 in December,
admitted in pre-game remarks that he could scarcely contain his
excitement at the prospect of realizing his long-cherished dream of
sharing a court with his son.</p>
<p>“Just to run out the tunnel knowing that he’ll be in uniform, run out
the tunnel with him, see him warm up, and be out there with the rest of
my teammates,” James told reporters during a morning shoot-around on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This is my 22nd time running out on opening night so I don’t know
how many times I’ll have an opportunity, how many times I’ve got left to
run out. I won’t take it for granted.”</p>
<p>Anticipation about the James double-act has dominated the Lakers’
preparations for the new season since Bronny James was selected by the
franchise with the 55th pick in the draft in June.</p>
<p>‘It’s been a treat’</p>
<p>Bronny James, 20, is expected to spend most of his rookie season in
the developmental G-League rather than the Lakers senior squad.</p>
<p>LeBron James however said Tuesday that he had relished being able to
accompany his son on his first steps into professional basketball.</p>
<p>“It’s been a treat and just in preseason, the practices, just every
day,” James said. “The plane rides, the bus rides of being with him and
showing him the ropes, along with his teammates and coaches. Just what
this professional life is all about and how to prepare every day …
super-duper cool.”</p>
<p>Bronny James’ ascent to the ranks of the NBA has been made all the
more remarkable given that just over a year ago he suffered a cardiac
arrest during a workout with his University of Southern California
college team-mates.</p>
<p>James Sr. said his son’s swift recovery from that life-threatening
episode had convinced him that he would one day play in the NBA.</p>
<p>“To see him play in a college Division I game the same year he had
heart surgery … I knew that at that moment that there really was going
to be nothing to stop him from anything that he wants to do,” James
said.</p>
<p>Bronny said at the Lakers recent media day he was fueled by the words
of critics who have suggested he owes his place on the Lakers roster
entirely to his superstar father.</p>
<p>“I’m just taking all that stuff, that criticism and backlash that
people have given me and turning it into something that can fuel me,” he
said.</p>

id="giuliani-ordered-to-turn-over-nyc-apartment-26-watches-to-georgia-election-workers">Giuliani
ordered to turn over NYC apartment, 26 watches to Georgia election
workers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani must turn over sports memorabilia and other prized
possessions to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million
defamation judgment against him, including his New York City apartment,
more than two dozen luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes once owned by
movie star Lauren Bacall, a judge ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan also said Giuliani
does not have to give the election workers three New York Yankees World
Series rings or his Florida condominium — for now — noting those assets
are tied up in other litigation.</p>
<p>The property Giuliani must relinquish is expected to fetch several
million dollars for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss.
They won the $148 million judgment over Giuliani’s false ballot fraud
claims against them related to the 2020 presidential election. They said
Giuliani pushed Donald Trump’s lies about the election being stolen,
which led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.</p>
<p>Under Tuesday’s order, Giuliani must relinquish within seven days his
Manhattan apartment, estimated at more than $5 million, as well as his
interest in about $2 million that he says Trump’s 2020 presidential
campaign owes him for his services.</p>
<p>Also on the list of assets that must be given to Freeman and Moss are
a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500 previously owned by Bacall; a shirt and
picture signed, respectively, by Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and Reggie
Jackson; a signed Yankee Stadium picture; a diamond ring; costume
jewelry and 26 watches including a Rolex, five Shinolas, two Bulovas and
a Tiffany &amp; Co.</p>
<p>In court documents filed earlier this year, Giuliani estimated the
Mercedes was worth about $25,000, and the watches, World Series rings
and costume jewelry at about $30,000. He said the value of his sports
memorabilia was unknown.</p>
<p>One of those watches was given to Giuliani by his grandfather and he
asked that he be allowed to keep it because of its sentimental value.
But Liman rejected the request, saying Giuliani could have had it
exempted if he had proven it was worth less than $1,000 — but he did not
do so.</p>
<p>“The Court also does not doubt that certain of the items may have
sentimental value to Defendant,” the judge added. “But that does not
entitle Defendant to continued enjoyment of the assets to the detriment
of the Plaintiffs to whom he owes approximately $150 million. It is,
after all, the underlying policy of these New York statutes that ‘no man
should be permitted to live at the same time in luxury and in
debt.’”</p>
<p>Liman wrote that Freeman and Moss would be allowed to sell off the
property and “ensure that the liquidation of the transferred assets is
accomplished quickly.”</p>
<p>Giuliani had asked the judge to bar Freeman and Moss from selling any
of his assets until after his appeal of the judgment is completed. Liman
also rejected that request, saying Giuliani could have asked the federal
court in Washington, D.C., where Freeman and Moss won their case, to
stay any asset sales pending his appeal, but he did not.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyers, Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski, said in a
statement Tuesday night, “Stay tuned. When the judgment is reversed in
the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., these Plaintiffs will be
required to return all this property to Mr. Giuliani. We repeat, stay
tuned.”</p>
<p>To date, Giuliani has not paid Freeman and Moss anything.</p>
<p>“We are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of
the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani’s actions,”
Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss, said in a statement. “This
outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for
those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.”</p>
<p>As for the World Series rings, Giuliani’s son, Andrew, filed court
documents earlier this month saying he actually is the rightful owner.
He said his father gave him four rings — one for each of the Yankees’
championships in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 — as gifts in 2018. Rudy
Giuliani received the rings during his tenure as mayor of New York City.
The younger Giuliani’s claim is pending in federal court in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>Freeman and Moss also asked Liman to order Rudy Giuliani to turn over
his condo in Palm Beach, Florida, estimated to be worth more than $3
million. But that property is tied up in other litigation, with Giuliani
claiming it should be exempt because it is his primary residence.
Freeman and Moss have a lien on the Florida property.</p>
<p>Liman said he would take up the Florida condo at a hearing Oct. 28,
and he barred Giuliani from selling the property or taking any action
that would diminish its value.</p>
<p>After the $148 million verdict, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, which
froze attempts by Freeman and Moss to collect the award. But a judge in
July threw out the case citing repeated “uncooperative conduct,”
including a failure to comply with court orders and disclose sources of
income.</p>

id="e.-coli-outbreak-tied-to-mcdonalds-quarter-pounder-kills-1-sickens-dozens-in-us">E.
coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder kills 1, sickens dozens
in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>One person died and dozens fell ill from E. coli infections linked to
McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers in 10 states, led by Colorado,
where 26 people were sickened, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The E. coli outbreak, linked to one of McDonald’s most popular menu
items, has sickened 49 people and sent 10 to the hospital, officials
say.</p>
<p>The strain involved, E. coli O157:H7, can cause serious illness and
was the source of a 1993 outbreak that killed four children who ate
undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants.</p>
<p>Shares of the world’s largest fast-food chain were down about 6% in
extended trading. A livestock trader said the outbreak also could
pressure U.S. cattle futures on Wednesday by threatening demand for
beef.</p>
<p>Everyone interviewed as part of an investigation into the outbreak
has reported eating at McDonald’s before their illness started, and most
mentioned eating a Quarter Pounder hamburger, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>The specific ingredient linked to the illness has not been identified
but investigators are focused on fresh, slivered onions and fresh beef
patties, the CDC said.</p>
<p>Most of the illnesses were reported in Colorado and Nebraska.</p>
<p>“The initial findings from the investigation indicate that a subset
of illnesses may be linked to slivered onions used in the Quarter
Pounder and sourced by a single supplier that serves three distribution
centers,” McDonald’s North America Chief Supply Chain Officer Cesar Piña
said in a statement.</p>
<p>McDonald’s has proactively removed the slivered onions and beef
patties used for the Quarter Pounder hamburgers from stores in the
affected states while the investigation continues, the company informed
the CDC.</p>
<p>U.S. food safety attorney Bill Marler, who represented a victim in
the Jack in the Box outbreak, said more cases of illness could surface.
Onions have been linked to prior E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks, he said.</p>
<p>According to Marler, a founder of Marler Clark in Seattle, beef
contamination is less common due to food safety measures. “You’d have to
have multiple restaurants under-cooking the meat,” he said.</p>
<p>McDonald’s is temporarily removing the Quarter Pounder from
restaurants in the impacted areas, including Colorado, Kansas, Utah and
Wyoming, it said in a statement, adding it was working with suppliers to
replenish supply in the coming week.</p>
<p>Symptoms for E. coli include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and
vomiting. Most people who suffer an infection will start feeling sick
three to four days after eating or drinking something that contains the
bacteria, Colorado’s public health department said. However, illnesses
can start anywhere from one to 10 days after exposure, the department
added.</p>
<p>In 2015, burrito chain Chipotle saw its sales battered and reputation
hit due to E.coli outbreaks in several states. That outbreak was linked
to a different strain of E. coli that typically causes less severe
illness than E. coli O157:H7.</p>
<p>In addition to Colorado, the CDC said small clusters of a few people
fell ill after eating a Quarter Pounder in Nebraska, Utah and Wyoming.
Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Iowa, Wisconsin and Montana had one illness
apiece.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli leaders in
Tel Aviv Tuesday, pushing to increase humanitarian access to

Hezbollah. But as White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports,
both appear elusive.</p>

In the weeks after Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the Southeast, the
price to rebuild has become a topic of contention in the home insurance
market. For years, home insurers have identified climate change as a
threat, cut coverage and increased premiums for properties in
disaster-prone areas. But now, home insurers are also using new
technologies such as drone footage and artificial intelligence to
identify other high-risk areas in urban and suburban neighborhoods.

<p>
Then, we’ll get into what headline inflation measures leave out of the
cost of housing. And, how do we prepare for the upcoming Election Day in
the shadow of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol? Later, we’ll
hear from listeners on voting from overseas and the origins of
trick-or-treating.

<h2 id="made-in-china-election-merchandise-floods-us-market">‘Made in
China’ election merchandise floods US market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As the United States presidential election enters its
final phase, more and more voters are expressing support for their
favored candidate by wearing election merchandise.</p>
<p>What they may not realize is that the “Make America Great Again”
Trump hat or “Childless Cat Lady for Harris” T-shirt they’re wearing
quite possibly was made in China.</p>
<p>With the help of e-commerce platforms, Chinese traders are flooding
the market for U.S. election merchandise with cheap goods. Anecdotal
evidence suggests U.S. makers of these products are struggling to
compete.</p>
<p>“I think the amount of stuff on Amazon and Etsy that’s coming from
China and other countries in cargo ships and unloaded on American shores
is drastically impacting American manufacturers’, like myself, ability
to compete and grow our own business. I think it’s dramatic,” said Ben
Waxman, founder and co-owner of American Roots, an American apparel
company.</p>
<p>Waxman wouldn’t share production or profit figures with VOA Mandarin
Service because of privacy concerns, but he did say his U.S.-made
campaign T-shirts, for example, sell for about $15 each, while those on
Chinese online retailer Temu can sell for as little as $3.</p>
<p>“It’s more expensive when you pay higher wages, living wages, and
abide by environmental standards,” Waxman said, referring to
long-standing criticisms of China’s manufacturing practices.</p>
<p>His unionized company has been producing campaign merchandise for
presidential candidates since 2016, mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts,
with all raw materials and production sourced within the U.S.</p>
<p>Flooding the market</p>
<p>VOA Mandarin Service was unable to find total sales figures for
made-in-America election merchandise versus made-in-China ones. But the
massive number of Chinese-made election products for sale on e-commerce
platforms, including Amazon and eBay, show they are flooding the
market.</p>
<p>On Temu alone, tens of thousands of election-themed items have been
sold at a fraction of the price of the official campaigns’ versions.</p>
<p>Among them, a “Make America Great Again” hat costs less than $4,
while the official Trump campaign store website, which boasts “All
Products Made in the USA,” sells them for 10 times that price at $40
each.</p>
<p>Likewise, Temu’s “Kamala Harris 2024” hats can sell for less than $3
each, while the official Kamala Harris campaign store website sells
“Kamala” hats for $47 each.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign also vowed to only sell products made in the U.S.
on its official websites.</p>
<p>VOA asked both campaigns for comment but didn’t receive a response by
the time of publication.</p>
<p>The stark contrast in prices highlights the challenges the U.S. faces
in reducing its dependence on Chinese products and closing a trade
loophole, known as the de minimis loophole, that allows Chinese
companies to ship goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. without paying
import duties.</p>
<p>Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile
Organizations, a labor union-aligned organization, said abuse of the de
minimis loophole is rampant, adding that her group “lost 21
manufacturing operations over the last 18 months.”</p>
<p>Glas said some of NCTO’s member manufacturers found sales of campaign
products are slower this year than in any previous U.S. election
cycle.</p>
<p>VOA Mandarin reached out to Amazon and eBay for comments on the
volume of presidential campaign merchandise imported from China on their
websites and their regulations of the Chinese vendors but didn’t receive
a response by the time of publication.</p>
<p>Temu didn’t comment on election product sales in the U.S., but the
company’s spokesperson replied in an email to VOA Mandarin, “Temu’s
growth isn’t dependent on the de minimis policy. The primary drivers
behind our rapid expansion and market acceptance are the supply-chain
efficiencies and operational proficiencies we’ve cultivated over the
years.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added, “We are open to and supportive of any policy
adjustments made by legislators that align with consumer interests.”</p>
<p>U.S. textile industry representatives note the irony of the two U.S.
presidential candidates talking tough on trade with China while their
own followers are buying China-made products to show their support for
them.</p>
<p>“If someone is supporting a candidate because of that candidate’s
economic policy and their position toward improving our economy and
improving our environment and improving our labor conditions, and doing
so by increasing the amount of domestic manufacturing, and then they’re
supporting a candidate by buying a product that’s made in a country that
stands for the opposite of that, they’re actually doing themselves and
the candidate and the economy a disservice,” said Mitch Cahn, president
of Unionwear, a New York-based apparel company that has supplied more
than 300,000 baseball caps to Harris’ campaign.</p>
<p>‘Anybody can make the product’</p>
<p>Cahn notes that anyone can produce campaign products because the
campaigns don’t control their intellectual property. They think “it’s
more valuable for them to have a person wear the campaign’s name on
their head than it is to make money from selling the merchandise.”</p>
<p>“When anybody can make the product and sell it, a lot of the products
are going to end up being made in China because there’s just not a lot
of manufacturers here,” he told VOA Mandarin.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported on October 18 that thousands of Donald
Trump’s “God Bless America” Bibles were printed in China. The AP also
noted that most Bibles, not just the Trump-backed one, are made in
China.</p>
<p>Critics note Trump’s promotion of Made in the USA products could be
undermined by the revelation.</p>
<p>“In past [election] years, this would’ve been a scandal,” says Marc
Zdanow, a political consultant and CEO of Engage Voters U.S. “I think
Trump voters just don’t care. … I guess the question is whether or not
this rises to the top for those voters who are still undecided. This
issue is certainly one that could be enough to push this group away from
Trump.”</p>
<p>Chris Tang, a business administration and global management professor
at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, told VOA Mandarin the impact of
merchandise made in China on the U.S. economy is not simply about
one-sided manufacturing job losses. Consumers also get these products at
low prices.</p>
<p>“While there are job losses in manufacturing, it creates
opportunities for small businesses to import small quantities quickly
using [online Chinese sellers like] Alibaba to find suppliers to produce
election merchandise quickly and sell them online quickly.”</p>
<p>Tang said the U.S. should develop a manufacturing sector that focuses
on high-value products, not cheap ones such as U.S. election
merchandise.</p>

<h2 id="clean-energy-stocks-are-bracing-for-a-trump-victory">Clean
Energy Stocks Are Bracing for a Trump Victory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg0MTc5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDE3MTMwNH0.uk2uYD_FNeKNf3yEIRR5jR4jEWHYIL_RVX-5mhEYq4M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If you look at the polls, the presidential election — now exactly two
weeks away — is very close. If you listen to the prognosticators, Trump
has a slight edge. And if you look at the markets,
<a href="https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024/will-donald-trump-win-the-2024-us-presidential-election" target="_blank">whether
prediction markets</a> or
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/billionaire-investor-says-wall-street-very-convinced-trump-win-2024-election" target="_blank">Wall
Street</a>, Trump’s chances are looking pretty good, with a sweep of the
White House and both houses of Congress now firmly on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Politics prediction market data have tilted toward a win by former
President Trump, and markets have responded in line with this
development,” Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Wilson wrote in a note to
clients Monday. “Such an outcome should now be taken seriously,” wrote
Jefferies global head of equity strategy Christopher Wood in a separate
note last week.
</p>
<p>
And seriously is exactly how the market appears to be taking it, with a
range of assets now seeming to be pricing in a Trump victory. Yields on
Treasury bonds are also rising, which may be because traders see fewer
interest rate cuts coming in a
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/interest-rates-higher-trump-president-c3010e8a" target="_blank">more
inflationary Trump economy</a> fueled by tax cuts, spending, and an
icing of tariffs on top. Gold and Bitcoin prices have risen in the past
month as well.
</p>
<p>
But what about the clean energy economy? Trump often speaks critically
of the Inflation Reduction Act, clean energy in general, and wind energy
in particular. With Republicans in control of Congress, those sentiments
are more likely to be be turned into policy … of some kind.
</p>
<p>
For investors in clean energy companies, Trump’s improving odds make for
nervous times. In the initial days after a Trump victory, as the reality
solidifies, you’ll likely see some big price swings. Eight years ago, on
Wednesday, November 9, 2016, an exchange traded fund that tracks around
100 clean energy stock called iShares Global Clean Energy, which is used
as a benchmark for the industry as a whole, fell almost 5%, even as
stocks overall jumped. In 2020, the fund rose more than 6.5% percent
between close on election day and the following Monday, after networks
had called the race for Joe Biden.
</p>
<p>
“I think stocks will trade on sentiment” following a win in either
direction, Maheep Mandloi, an analyst at Mizuho, told me. “We’ll
probably see that knee-jerk reaction.”
</p>
<p>
The iShares fund has been falling recently, dropping from $14.77 on
September 27, when Kamala Harris peaked at 58.1% in Nate Silver’s
polling models, to 47% on Monday, when Trump’s probability to win
reached 52.7%.
</p>
<p>
“Renewables underperformed last week,” Mandloi wrote in a note to
clients on Tuesday, with the iShares ETF down compared to the S&amp;P
500 index. That sluggishness mostly came from solar stocks, particularly
residential companies like Sunnova, Sunrun, Enphase, and Solaredge —
“likely due to election, concerns” Mandloi added.
</p>
<p>
The fall has been even more dramatic for companies more exposed to
Trump’s particular (dis)taste in energy, namely wind. U.S.-traded shares
in Vestas, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer, have fallen over 16%
since Harris peaked in the forecasts last month through Monday.
</p>
<p>
But a number of analysts are more sanguine about the fate of the IRA and
the clean energy economy it has fostered. For one, the politics of
repeal might not hold up in a Trumpified Washington. In August, 18 House
Republicans in competitive districts
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/25/republican-fight-inflation-reduction-act-00176223" target="_blank">wrote
a letter</a> to House Speaker Mike Johnson asking him not to target the
clean energy tax credits at
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/25/republican-fight-inflation-reduction-act-00176223" target="_blank">the
core of the law</a>. These same House Republicans have supported
Johnson’s speakership where he’s taken flack from the body’s most
conservative members, so this is hardly a constituency he can afford to
ignore. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
Even if a reconciliation bill passed next year were to scrap some or all
of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, the Internal Revenue Service
could — as it has in the past when tax credits were about to expire —
write rules that
<a href="https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2021/7/irs-further-extends-continuity-safe-harbor-2016-later-renewable-energy-projects/" target="_blank">allow
projects to claim the credits for years</a> to come, Mandloi told me.
</p>
<p>
In any case, people in the tax credit market don’t seem to think the IRA
tax credits are particularly at risk. “Political uncertainty has slowed
the development of some industries,” analysts at LevelTen, a clean
energy financial infrastructure company, wrote in a report last week.
“It it hasn’t stopped the tax credit market from growing.” They assigned
a low likelihood to a complete gutting of the IRA, noting that “there is
bipartisan support for the investments catalyzed by the IRA across the
nation.”
</p>
<p>
While it’s possible that the bipartisan enthusiasm for investments
stemming from the Inflation Reduction Act could protect much of the
bill, the parts of the bill that directly support manufacturers may be
the safest, namely the advanced manufacturing tax credit that has been
especially popular in the solar industry.
</p>
<p>
These credits have been complemented by aggressive trade policy as well.
Some of Trump’s
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines-solar-panels.html" target="_blank">earliest
tariffs were on solar panels</a>, and the Biden administration has also
tried to protect the domestic solar manufacturing industry from
“overproduction” in China and Southeast Asia. First Solar
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/first-solar-announces-fifth-us-factory-as-climate-deal-fuels-domestic-manufacturing.html" target="_blank">has
thrown itself into domestic manufacturing</a> with the wind of the
Inflation Reduction Act’s
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/first-solar-45X-advanced-manufacturing-tax-credit-inflation-reduction-act-ira/703664/#:~:text=First%20Solar%20has%20agreed%20to,credits%20transferred%20from%20First%20Solar." target="_blank">manufacturing
tax credits at its back</a>. Bonuses for solar developers
<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/first-solar-shares-jump-following-us-treasury-guidance-domestic-content-requirements-2" target="_blank">whose
systems are made up of</a> “domestic content” have helped, as well.
<br/>
</p>
<p>
Morningstar analyst Brett Castelli wrote to investors a note last month
acknowledging the risk to solar stocks from a change in White House
party control. First Solar specifically, however, “would likely benefit
from proposed trade policies, such as higher tariffs, under a Republican
administration.”
</p>
<p>
The company’s stock is up 14% so far this year through Monday, although
it has dipped as Harris has dipped in election forecast. The Invesco
Solar ETF, which tracks the broad solar industry, is down 13% on the
year.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“First Solar is unique in our view in the fact that it is
relatively indifferent regardless of outcome,” Castelli told me this
week. It’s helped by sheer size. “They have the largest U.S. presence
for manufacturing solar panels here, domestically,” he said. “The
biggest competitive threat to those factories would be cheap imports
from China or Southeast Asia.”
</p>
<p>
But while the renewable energy industry is always at the risk of public
policy shifts, for good and for ill, there’s another, harder to predict
and harder to tame factor: interest rates.
</p>
<p>
Despite the spigot from Washington due to the IRA, many renewables
companies have not been doing great in the stock market in recent years,
and high interest rates are likely the reason why.
</p>
<p>
For renewables,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables" target="_self">most
of the cost comes from simply building the thing</a>. The “fuel,”
whether it be photons or wind, is free. This means that renewables
projects are highly sensitive to the price of the borrowed money they
need for construction. While the Federal Reserve
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_self">has
finally begun to cut rates</a> and anticipates continuing doing so
through the end of next year, it’s by no means something it’s mandated
to do, especially if there’s a major change in fiscal policy going
forward.
</p>
<p>
Predicting the path of interest rates is something people get paid far,
far more than journalists’ salaries to do, and they’re often wrong. That
being said, it’s not hard to see a world where a sizable Trump win keeps
rates elevated.
</p>
<p>
As president, he showed zero appetite for fiscal restraint, and going
into round two has indicated a desire for sizable tax cuts and almost
nothing specific for any large scale cuts in spending, policy
preferences that may be more likely to be indulged in a Washington under
unified Republican control. “Interest Rates Will Be Higher in the
Future, Especially if Trump Is President,”
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/interest-rates-higher-trump-president-c3010e8a" target="_blank">the
<em>Wall Street Journal</em> declared earlier this month.</a>
</p>
<p>
The “downside scenario” for stocks envisioned by Jonathan Golub, chief
U.S. equity strategist at UBS investment bank, largely follows this
scenario. “A combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus causes a
reacceleration in inflation, forcing the Fed to abandon their rate cut
plans,” he wrote to clients earlier this month. Clean energy could be
hardest hit, no matter what happens to the IRA.

interview: US Army General Costanza discusses Russia’s threat to
West</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine is reshaping the strategic landscape of Europe.
While Western and Eastern European nations within the NATO alliance
recognize the Russian threat, each day, NATO nations bordering Belarus
and Russia feel the immediacy of the threat.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with VOA’s Eastern Europe Bureau Chief
Myroslava Gongadze, Lieutenant General Charles Costanza, commander of
the U.S. Army’s V Corps (also known as the Fifth Corps) in Poland,
discusses how NATO adapts to Russia’s evolving tactics while defending
its members’ borders.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: Can you explain the different threat assessments from Eastern
and Western European partners of NATO regarding Russia?</p>
<p>Charles Costanza, commanding general of the U.S. Army’s V Corps:
Clearly, in the eastern flank of Europe, the threat is real. They’re on
the border with Belarus and Russia, and so, they see that threat every
day differently. You see recent open-source reporting on the Russian
UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] coming over Romanian
territory and Lithuanian territory. Those incursions have increased. You
see the sabotage operations going on throughout eastern flank countries
and Eastern European countries. So, Russia is increasing that, short of
… challenges and interference [that would trigger the NATO mutual
defense clause].</p>
<p>VOA: Do you think Russia is doing it deliberately?</p>
<p>Costanza: Of course, they are. They weaponize immigration — I say
“weaponize” deliberately. This weaponized immigration is happening in
Poland, it’s all been driven from Russia to interfere in Eastern Europe.
Moldova is a near-term example with their elections. Russia is actively
interfering in those elections to try and shape them in a pro-Russian
way. So, all that is going on right now. So, that’s part of this threat
assessment piece that isn’t necessarily impacting the Western European
countries as much as Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>VOA: How threatening is Russia’s military?</p>
<p>Costanza: I think there’s a view that Russia is going to take three
to 10 years to reconstitute, and I think that we need to look at that a
little differently. Russian armed forces, ground forces right now, are
actually bigger than they were before the war with Ukraine started 2½
years ago, despite the losses of open-source reporting [of] 600,000
casualties that they’ve incurred during the course of the war.</p>
<p>They may not be as well trained, but they’re bigger. Their industrial
base is on a wartime footing. Their mobilization base is on a wartime
footing. They know they’re fighting a Western-trained, West-equipped
country with Ukraine. They’re learning how to defeat those capabilities
and those systems over the last 2½ years. So, they’re modernizing their
force based on the lessons that they’re learning, and I think that’s
something we should be concerned about. They’re modernizing their
equipment. They’re changing the way that they fight based on learning
how to fight against Western-trained forces in Ukraine. And I think that
should be a concern for all of us. It clearly is to our Eastern European
allies.</p>
<p>VOA: How are you preparing to defend and deter?</p>
<p>Costanza: First of all, to maintain a high stance on readiness from a
U.S. forces standpoint but also the NATO standpoint. At the Fifth Corps,
one of the key things we do as partners with our multinational corps and
multinational divisions across the eastern flank of Europe [is] just to
help build their war-fighting capability as they field new capabilities.
HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System], for example. Apaches
[helicopters] — with Poland just purchasing 96 Apaches from the United
States. So, we help them to employ those things, those capabilities. But
how you employ them at the corps level, and how you employ them at the
division level, we can help, and we do.</p>
<p>VOA: General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief of the
Ukrainian Armed Forces and now ambassador to the United Kingdom,
recently gave a speech at Chatham House in London in which he talked
about the technological advancements of this war, and how this is a
different war than NATO was prepared to fight. How would you assess
NATO’s capabilities today?</p>
<p>Costanza: I think you’re exactly right. And those are some of the
comments that were made by our NATO partners in this event. I think that
the United States is kind of setting the standard on that with a new
program that our chief of staff of the Army [General Randy George] has
talked about, which is transformation in contact. So, for the U.S.
forces that are rotating over here to Europe, we’re modernizing them
with equipment that’s available right now. So, instead of going through
our normal four-year acquisition process to get new equipment, we’re
taking things that are available based on what we’re watching happen in
Ukraine. … So maybe that can be a model for our partners and allies.</p>
<p>VOA: We talked about NATO capabilities. Now I want to go back to
Russian capabilities. How advanced do you think they are right now?</p>
<p>Costanza: I think the biggest concern is what I said before: They
know they’re fighting Western-trained and -equipped forces. And so, as
they modernize based on the lessons that they’re learning — not just
their equipment, but how they fight — they’re really sharpening their
ability to fight us in the future. And I think that’s something we need
to be concerned about.</p>
<p>So, those things I just talked about that we’re trying to rapidly
introduce into our brigade to execute the transformation, contact — the
UAS [Unmanned Aircraft Systems, or drones], the border, ammunition, the
counter UAS, the EW [electronic warfare] capability. And how do you
synchronize all of that capability so that you can really, rapidly
strike and kill targets? They’ve learned how to do that. And so, we need
to be able to do that and do it better than they do.</p>
<p>VOA: Russia is gaining support from China and North Korea right now.
Are we ready to face this threat?</p>
<p>Costanza: The lessons that I was talking about, the reasons we should
be concerned about Russia — they’re sharing those lessons with China,
with Iran, and vice versa, the capabilities that Iran and China are
providing. And now you see the North Koreans, as well. North Korea is
now providing, I think it’s an initial batch [of] open-source reporting,
of 4,000 North Korean soldiers. I think that could potentially just be a
starting point for what they provide in terms of manpower to Russia. And
I think that’s a problem near-term here in Eastern Europe, because as we
talked about before we started, the challenge for Ukrainians is people.
It’s the amount of people that they have to put into this fight. And
Russia doesn’t care how many losses it takes. I mean, 600,000
[casualties], and they’re still throwing more manpower at it and don’t
even blink. Ukrainians can’t afford to take those losses. I think that’s
going to be the limiting factor for that as we move forward, watch this
war continue into this third period.</p>
<p>VOA: There are different assessments of threats between, let’s say,
the political part of the NATO alliance and the military part of the
alliance. How are you finding that common ground?</p>
<p>Costanza: Yeah, I think it’s just constant dialogue, right? And so, I
know we do that at different levels. So, the combatant commander, the
U.S. combat commander, has those discussions at the national levels with
our NATO partners and allies. We all live in Eastern Europe, including
myself — in Poland. We all see that threat the same way. It can be near
term.</p>
<p>VOA: What do you mean by the near term?</p>
<p>Costanza: I think, one year, two years, three years.</p>
<p>VOA: And you’re trying to be ready for that?</p>
<p>Costanza: U.S. forces are ready, and I can tell you, our NATO
partners and allies are ready. And we’re just continuing to build
capabilities.</p>

id="us-warns-ramped-up-election-influence-efforts-aim-to-stoke-violence">US
warns ramped-up election influence efforts aim to stoke violence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Efforts by U.S. adversaries to divide Americans and sow
growing distrust in the upcoming presidential election have already
begun to intensify, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, who
warn some countries appear to be leaning toward additional measures to
spark election-related violence.</p>
<p>The latest declassified assessment, issued Tuesday by the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence, comes just two weeks before
voters head to the polls November 5 to choose a new president and vote
on a series of statewide and local races and initiatives.</p>
<p>“Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent
on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine
Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what
they perceive to be in their interests,” according to the
assessment.</p>
<p>But it warns U.S. intelligence agencies are “increasingly confident”
that Russia is starting to engage in plans “aimed at inciting
violence.”</p>
<p>It further assesses Iran also “may try to incite violence.”</p>
<p>Post-poll closing concerns</p>
<p>Of particular concern is what appears to be a growing focus on the
hours, days and weeks after the polls close, when state and local
election officials begin to tally and certify the results.</p>
<p>U.S. adversaries “probably will be quick to create false narratives
or amplify content they think will create confusion about the election,
such as posting claims of election irregularities,” said a U.S.
intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity
to discuss the assessment in additional detail.</p>
<p>The official said Russia, Iran and China “may perceive a window of
vulnerability to push disinformation or foment or amplify protests and
threats” starting with the moment polling centers close and extending to
January 6, when the presidential results are certified by a joint
session of Congress.</p>
<p>“Foreign driven or amplified violent protests, violence or physical
threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge
state and local officials’ ability to conduct elements of the
certification and Electoral College process,” the official said.
“Particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or
venues.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials have previously warned that Russia and
Iran have been especially active, running a variety of influence
operations targeting U.S. voters, with a high likelihood that these
efforts would extend beyond the November 5 election.</p>
<p>Russia, they said, has been working to boost the chances of former
president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has
been working to hurt Trump’s reelection bid and instead buoy the
campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential
nominee.</p>
<p>China, according to U.S. intelligence officials, has so far stayed
out of the presidential race, focusing its efforts on congressional and
state and local candidates perceived to be promoting policies
detrimental to Beijing’s interests, including those voicing support for
Taiwan.</p>
<p>Officials said Tuesday that new intelligence streams have raised
concerns that Moscow, especially, will try to foment violence once the
polls close.</p>
<p>“We expect Russia will be more aggressive in this period if the vice
president [Kamala Harris] wins the election,” the intelligence official
said. “Russia would prefer the former president to win, and they would
seek to more aggressively undermine the presidency of the
then-president-elect.”</p>
<p>Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of
election meddling.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment,
but China on Tuesday again rejected the latest U.S. intelligence
findings.</p>
<p>“The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,” Liu
Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA
in an email. “China has no intention and will not interfere.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials, though, point to what they describe as
growing examples of malign intent, especially by Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>Influence operations</p>
<p>In one example, the officials said Russian-linked actors were
responsible for a post on the X social media platform earlier this month
that contained false allegations against Democratic vice presidential
candidate Tim Walz.</p>
<p>“There are several indicators of manipulation that are consistent
with the influence, efforts and tactics of Russian influence actors this
cycle,” the U.S. intelligence official said.</p>
<p>In another case, U.S. officials said a Russian intelligence unit
sought to recruit what they assess to likely be an unwitting American to
organize protests.</p>
<p>They also point to actions taken last month by multiple U.S. agencies
to counter several Russian influence efforts, including the use of fake
websites and the creation of a shell company to funnel $10 million to a
U.S. media company to push pro-Russian propaganda.</p>
<p>Also last month, the U.S. placed bounties and lodged criminal charges
against three Iranian hackers, all accused of seeking to undermine the
Trump reelection campaign.</p>
<p>And there are fears that even these types of ongoing influence
operations, which often seek to exploit divisive political issues, could
lead to problems.</p>
<p>“Even if these disinformation campaigns are not specifically calling
for violence, the tactics used to undermine confidence in the democratic
institutions can lead to violence, even if not deliberately called for,”
said a senior official with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, or CISA, who, like the U.S. intelligence official,
spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>‘Expect disruptions’</p>
<p>And while U.S. officials express confidence that safeguards are in
place to prevent U.S. adversaries from attacking or hacking systems used
to record and tally votes, there is concern that they will target other
U.S. infrastructure to try to induce panic or violence.</p>
<p>“That is a real possibility,” said the CISA official, adding the U.S.
public should “expect disruptions.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to see a voting location lose power,” the official said.
“We’re going to see potentially some type of impact on a transportation
system. We’re going to see a potential ransomware attack against a local
election office.”</p>
<p>CISA officials say they have been working with state and local
election officials to make sure they are prepared to handle sudden
disruptions. And state officials say they are prepared.</p>
<p>“All states consider their election infrastructure and IT
[information technology] systems a potential target for threats,” said
Steve Simon, Minnesota’s secretary of state and the president of the
National Association of Secretaries of State, during a call with
reporters Monday.</p>
<p>“Chief elections officials throughout the United States have worked
really tirelessly and consistently to mitigate risks to our election
systems and processes,” said Simon.</p>

<h2 id="biden-welcomes-slovenian-leader-golob-to-white-house">Biden
welcomes Slovenian leader Golob to White House</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday welcomed Slovenian Prime Minister
Robert Golob to the White House, where Biden spoke of the importance of
European unity and recognized the small Central European nation’s
outsized role in the largest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and
Russia in decades.</p>
<p>Biden underscored Ljubljana’s critical role in the August swap that
saw the release of 24 people, including three high-profile Americans in
Russian custody: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gerskovich, Radio
Free Europe reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.
Slovenia held two Russian spies in prison – and their release was a
critical part of the deal.</p>
<p>“You made it possible,” Biden said to Golob in the Oval Office.
“Thank you. We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies
matter. Well, just look at what you did. They matter a great deal.”</p>
<p>Biden, who spoke of his role in pushing for the nation to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization nearly two decades ago, continued his
push for European unity – diplomatically and through institutions like
the NATO security bloc – to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Because I knew then what I know now: We’re stronger when we stand
together with good partners like you,” Biden said. “We’ve seen it in
support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves
against Russia’s aggression and we see it in our work to support
democracy and prosperity across the western Balkans.”</p>
<p>Golob addressed Biden with “Dear Joe,” a greeting that has become
popular with European leaders.</p>
<p>“Mr. President, dear Joe, just a couple of words,” he said, in
English. “And that is with little help of true friends, nothing is
impossible. And I think that’s really what our joint effort with the
prisoner swap demonstrated to all of the world. And let’s continue to
work in true friendship and with a lot of friends.”</p>
<p>The two also discussed a wide range of issues, the White House said,
like energy security and cooperation and events in the Middle East.</p>
<p>This meeting – the first Oval Office visit by a Slovenian leader in
18 years – is “a particularly important legacy of Biden’s
administration,” said Wojciech Przybylski, editor-in-chief of
Warsaw-based think tank Visegrad Insight.</p>
<p>“Slovenia is also a major stakeholder in the development of other
Southeastern European countries of the Balkan region, where the U.S. is
investing heavily to make Europe whole and free from wars and autocratic
rule,” he told VOA via email.</p>
<p>“From a geopolitical point of view, Russian influence and even more
important Chinese influence, including Beijing’s ambitions to be the
dominant player in the Slovenian port of Koper, a major port on the
Adriatic Sea, is an important backdrop to the discussions on the
economic security of Central and Eastern Europe,” he said.</p>
<p>Donatienne Ruy, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told VOA by email that Golob’s visit is “an
important recognition of the small country’s contributions to
transatlantic relations, as both a NATO and an EU member.”</p>
<p>Slovenia, she said, is using its rotating presidency of the U.N.
Security Council to support Ukraine and is an “anchor for the Western
Balkans region.” And the country could soon play a big role in helming
the European Commission’s enlargement efforts, as the top diplomat in
line for the job is a left-leaning Slovene.</p>
<p>The nation hasn’t always held liberal stances, Ruy said.</p>
<p>“The country itself has seen ups and downs in governance in its
post-Communist history, most recently under former Prime Minister Janez
Jansa, who adopted an illiberal populist stance — he threatened the
independence of the media and regularly attacked his opponents
[rhetorically],” she said.</p>
<p>“The current government has been a more positive actor both on
governance and democracy issues and as an EU member, which the White
House visit likely acknowledges.”</p>
<p>Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
was less complimentary.</p>
<p>“I don’t see a lot of reasons for rewarding Slovenia’s PM with a
visit to the Oval Office,” he wrote to VOA by email. “Slovenia has made
little progress in bringing up its defense spending. It is not embarking
on massive purchases of U.S.-made equipment.</p>
<p>“Even in the EU context, the government has taken an extreme position
against Israel. The Prime Minister himself has faced domestic
controversy, including a criminal complaint for interfering with a
police investigation. In short, I don’t see much upside to Biden’s doing
this at this moment.”</p>
<p>VOA asked representatives from the campaign of former President
Donald Trump if he planned to meet with Golob during his U.S. visit.
Former first lady Melania Trump was born in the southern Slovenian city
of Novo Mesto. The campaign did not reply.</p>

charges Iranian Revolutionary Guard official in plot to kill VOA
host</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States has charged a senior Iranian official and three
others linked to Tehran for their role in a failed assassination plot
targeting VOA host Masih Alinejad.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ruhollah Bazghandi, a senior
official in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and three other
men linked to Tehran, with participating in a failed attempt to
assassinate VOA Persian Service journalist Alinejad in Brooklyn in 2022,
according to a new indictment made public on Tuesday.</p>
<p>These charges are the first to directly accuse a high-ranking
official in the Revolutionary Guard, or IRGC, with a role in the plot to
kill Iranian American Alinejad, a staunch critic of Iran’s repression of
women.</p>
<p>“Today’s indictment exposes the full extent of Iran’s plot to silence
an American journalist for criticizing the Iranian regime,” FBI Director
Christopher Wray said in a statement. “As these charges show, the FBI
will work with our partners here and abroad to hold accountable those
who target Americans.”</p>
<p>The indictment describes Bazghandi as a brigadier general with the
IRGC. The U.S. Treasury Department last year called him a
counterintelligence official.</p>
<p>Alinejad said this indictment confirms the lengths the Iranian
government will go to in order to silence its critics.</p>
<p>“It shows that this is in the DNA of the Revolutionary Guards,” she
told VOA.</p>
<p>‘Now we have proof’</p>
<p>When the FBI told Alinejad the news Tuesday morning, she said she
felt a mix of excitement and sadness.</p>
<p>“I was so excited because now we have proof that this is a member of
the Revolutionary Guards ordering a man in New York, from inside Iran,
to kill a U.S. citizen,” she said. “That was my reaction. Mixed
feelings. Happy, but at the same time sad that the same people cannot be
stopped from killing innocent women and men inside [Iran].”</p>
<p>When the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Bazghandi, it said
he had been involved with assassination plots against journalists and
others considered enemies of Tehran.</p>
<p>These aren’t the first charges related to the killing scheme. The
failed plot to kill Alinejad led to federal murder-for-hire charges
against members of an Eastern European criminal organization with
connections to Iran who were hired to carry out assassination.</p>
<p>Surveillance, harassment, intimidation</p>
<p>Iran is among the most prolific countries that reach across its
borders to target journalists and activists overseas in a process known
as transnational repression, according to Freedom House. Common tactics
include surveillance, harassment and intimidation.</p>
<p>The failed assassination plot came one year after a failed kidnapping
attempt against Alinejad in 2021. The FBI has said the kidnapping
attempt was part of a Tehran plot to bring Alinejad to Iran.</p>
<p>Since the kidnapping attempt, Alinejad has received U.S. government
protection and moved frequently between safe houses.</p>
<p>Despite the threats, Alinejad has refused to stop her work.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any guns and bullets — I don’t carry weapons. But this
government, they have everything, and they’re really scared of me,”
Alinejad told VOA late last year, referring to the Iranian government.
“And that gives me power — that, wow, even with my words, even with my
social media, I’m more powerful than them.”</p>
<p>‘This is about protecting democracy’</p>
<p>Iran is among the most censored countries in the world. At the end of
2023, Iran ranked among the worst jailers of journalists in the world,
according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, with 17 reporters
behind bars.</p>
<p>Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>While the United States is working to hold accountable perpetrators
in this case, Kiran Nazish, the founder of the Coalition for Women in
Journalism, told VOA that too many governments around the world aren’t
taking transnational repression seriously enough.</p>
<p>“We really want to learn from this moment — that it is possible to
make perpetrators accountable. And it is essential for courts and police
and law enforcement to really pay attention to the issue of
transnational repression,” Nazish said. </p>
<p>Alinejad said it’s important for the U.S. government to hold Iran
accountable for the plot and for Tehran’s broader use of transnational
repression.</p>
<p>“This is not a partisan issue. This is about protecting democracy.
Because I don’t think that they targeted me. I have no fear for my own
life,” Alinejad said. “The Iranian regime is challenging the U.S.
government on U.S. soil, and basically this is targeting freedom of
speech, and the national security and safety of America.”</p>

probing release of US intel on Israel’s attack plans for Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The FBI is investigating the public disclosure of a pair
of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s
preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the bureau said on
Tuesday. </p>
<p>“The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents
and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and
Intelligence Community,” it said in a statement. </p>
<p>White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday
that it has not been determined whether the disclosure was a hack or a
leak. President Joe Biden was watching the results of the investigation
closely, he added. </p>
<p>“We’re not exactly sure how these documents found their way into the
public domain,” Kirby told reporters. </p>
<p>“The president remains deeply concerned about any leakage of
classified information into the public domain. That is not supposed to
happen, and it’s unacceptable when it does,” he said. </p>
<p>The documents appear to have been prepared by the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, describing U.S. interpretations of
Israeli Air Force and Navy planning based on satellite imagery from
Oct. 15-16. </p>
<p>They began circulating last week on the Telegram messaging app.
Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic-missile barrage
carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran’s second direct attack on Israel
in six months. Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon,
days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. </p>
<p>U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said an
investigation was under way.</p>

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch chief arrested on sex trafficking charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former Abercrombie &amp; Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries and
two other men have been arrested on sex trafficking and interstate
prostitution charges, a spokesperson for federal prosecutors said
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Details of the criminal charges weren’t immediately available. They
come after years of sexual misconduct allegations, made in civil
lawsuits and the media, from young people who said Jeffries lured them
with promises of modeling work and then pressed them into sex acts.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for Brian Bieber, an attorney who
has represented Jeffries. Information on attorneys for the other
defendants wasn’t immediately available.</p>
<p>Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace and FBI and police officials
were set to hold a news conference later Monday.</p>
<p>Jeffries left New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in
2014.</p>
<p>One civil lawsuit filed in New York last year accused Abercrombie of
allowing Jeffries to run a sex-trafficking organization during his
22-year tenure. It said that Jeffries had modeling scouts scouring the
internet for victims, and that some prospective models became
sex-trafficking victims.</p>
<p>Abercrombie last year said it had hired an outside law firm to
conduct an independent investigation after a report on similar
allegations was aired by the BBC.</p>
<p>The BBC investigation included a dozen men who described being at
events involving sex acts they said were staged by Jeffries and his
partner, Matthew Smith, often at his home in New York and hotels in
London, Paris and elsewhere.</p>
<p>When the civil lawsuit was filed in New York last year, Bieber
declined to comment on the allegations.</p>

<p>
The way you bank and apply for credit could fundamentally change in the
next couple of years. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued
new rules this morning to give consumers more control over their
financial data, and spur competition in financial services. Then, it
appears to be a quiet period for business ahead of the election. And
later, how can companies tackle worker loneliness and isolation without
forced fun?

campus protest rules spur outcry from college faculty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dissent is thriving this fall at American colleges, and not just
among student activists. With student protests limited by new
restrictions, faculty have taken up the cause.  </p>
<p>To faculty, new protest rules threaten freedom of speech — and the
freedom to think, both central to university life. This semester, some
of the most visible demonstrations have involved professors speaking up
for the right to protest itself.  </p>
<p>Last spring, pro-Palestinian tent encampments crowded schools and
disrupted commencement plans, drawing accusations of antisemitism and
prompting new limits.  </p>
<p>At Indiana University, an “expressive activity policy” rolled out in
August prohibits protests after 11 p.m., bans camping on campus, and
requires pre-approval for signs. In defiance, each Sunday a group of
faculty members, students and community members gather on campus for
candlelight vigils that extend past the 11 p.m. deadline.  </p>
<p>Russ Skiba, a professor emeritus who has attended the vigils, said
the new restrictions are part of a larger movement to limit academic
freedom on campuses.  </p>
<p>In Indiana, the Republican governor in March signed a law increasing
state oversight of public universities. The law, sponsored by a lawmaker
who said colleges suffer from “monolithic thinking,” subjects faculty to
post-tenure reviews over whether they are fostering diversity of thought
and keeping their political views out of the classroom. Skiba and other
Indiana professors widely opposed the bill, which they criticized as
vague and subject to interpretation.  </p>
<p>“Universities are bastions of free speech, but when you have a
movement that is anti-democratic, one of the places that is most
attacked is freedom of speech,” Skiba said.  </p>
<p>Faculty members at colleges elsewhere around the country have pushed
back on the new rules with protests, vigils and demands for explanation.
 </p>
<p>A group of Harvard University professors held a “study-in” at a
campus library on Oct. 16 in support of pro-Palestinian students who
were temporarily banned from the library for holding a similar
demonstration. In September, a group representing University of
California faculty filed a complaint alleging the system sought to chill
their academic freedom and keep from teaching about the Israel-Hamas war
“in a way that does not align with the University’s own position.”  </p>
<p>To some professors, the protest restrictions are also a labor issue.
 </p>
<p>Colleges have been granting tenure to fewer professors, and facing
pressure in some areas to do away with it altogether. Legislatures in
several states have taken an interest in how topics around race, gender
and history are taught. Protest guidelines handed down by administrators
are another way the faculty’s say in university affairs is being
diminished, some professors say.  </p>
<p>“We have to, as faculty, organize and demand the sort of shared
governance that gives us a right to review and challenge these
policies,” said Todd Wolfson, a journalism and media studies professor
at Rutgers University and the president of the American Association of
University Professors. “They’re not made by people coming out of the
academic arm of our institutions.” </p>
<p>Tensions on campuses nationwide have been high since the war began
over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel,
killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250.
Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the
Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters.</p>
<p>Colleges have been under tremendous pressure, including from
Republicans in Congress, to protect students from discrimination while
upholding free speech. Demonstrations last spring blocked foot traffic
in parts of some campuses and included instances of antisemitic imagery
and rhetoric. Some Jewish faculty members and students have said the
protests made them feel unsafe.  </p>
<p>In a message announcing new guidelines at the start of the semester,
Northwestern University President Michael Schill said it needs to make
sure everyone on campus feels safe and supported.  </p>
<p>“Activities that lead to intimidation and impede an environment where
dialogue and education can flourish cannot occur again,” he said.  </p>
<p>Shirin Vossoughi, a Northwestern professor, was among 52 faculty
members who signed an open letter opposing the school’s new
demonstration policy as caving to political pressure to silence certain
types of activism. She said the rules crack down not just on free
speech, but pro-Palestinian voices in particular.  </p>
<p>During the protests last spring, some faculty members joined ranks
with demonstrators. Others acted as mediators for students they see as
under their care and protection. Faculty voted no confidence against
leaders of schools including Columbia University, the University of
Massachusetts, Brandeis University, and Cal Poly Humboldt over their
handling of the protests.  </p>
<p>At Northwestern University, Steven Thrasher was among three faculty
members charged by university police for obstructing law enforcement
during last spring’s protests. He was suspended and removed from
teaching this fall while under investigation by the university.</p>
<p>“The way that I saw my role was as a protector of the students’
safety and of their ability to express themselves,” Thrasher said this
fall. “I knew as soon as I started seeing violence happening towards
students that I would do what I could.”  </p>
<p>While schools say the rules are meant to limit disruptions, faculty
members say they have the effect of neutralizing dissent.  </p>
<p>“The whole point of a protest is to be seen and heard,” said Michael
Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia University, where new
rules require advance notice and prevent demonstrations that
“substantially inhibit the primary purposes” of an area of campus. “Free
speech rights aren’t served if you can only speak into the void and not
have anybody hear you, and that includes the right to be seen and heard
by people who don’t like what you have to say.”  </p>
<p>Professors also drew a connection to the growing percentage of
lecturers, adjuncts and professors who do not have tenure protections.
Professors increasingly see the issue of speech and academic freedom as
a labor issue as a result of the crackdowns, said Risa Lieberwitz,
AAUP’s general counsel.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing unionization growing and increasing,” she said. “I
think to some extent it’s because it’s so important to organize, to
claim democratic rights.”  </p>
<p>Wolfson said professors must stand up for students’ rights to
demonstrate and speak freely.  </p>
<p>“Their freedom of speech rights are the lifeblood of the university,”
Wolfson said. “We cannot have a university based on critical thinking
and exploring questions if we’re going to clamp down on students’ rights
to protest something they think is a massive problem, and if they see a
way for the university to actually engage in it productively.”</p>

id="imfs-economic-view-a-brighter-outlook-for-us-but-still-tepid-global-growth">IMF’s
economic view: A brighter outlook for US but still-tepid global
growth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday upgraded its
economic outlook for the United States this year, while lowering its
expectations for growth in Europe and China. It left its forecast for
global growth unchanged at a relatively lackluster 3.2% for 2024. </p>
<p>The IMF expects the U.S. economy — the world’s largest — to expand
2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on
the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United
States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains
in inflation-adjusted wages. </p>
<p>Next year, though, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to decelerate to
2.2% growth. With a new presidential administration and Congress in
place, the IMF envisions the nation’s job market losing some momentum in
2025 as the government begins seeking to curb huge budget deficits by
slowing spending, raising taxes or some combination of both. </p>
<p>The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic
growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. In its latest
forecast, it expects China’s economic growth to slow from 5.2% last year
to 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025. The world’s No. 2 economy has been
hobbled by a collapse in its housing market and by weak consumer
confidence — problems only partly offset by strong exports. </p>
<p>The 20 European countries that share the euro currency are
collectively expected to eke out 0.8% growth this year, twice the 2023
expansion of 0.4% but a slight downgrade from the 0.9% the IMF had
forecast three months ago for 2024. The German economy, hurt by a slump
in manufacturing and real estate, isn’t expected to grow at all this
year. </p>
<p>Worldwide inflation has been cooling — from 6.7% in 2023 to a
forecast 5.8% this year and 4.3% in 2025. It’s falling even faster in
the world’s wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to a forecast 2.6%
this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in
2025. The progress against inflation has allowed the Fed and the
European Central Bank to finally reduce rates after they had
aggressively raised them to combat the post-COVID-19 inflation
surge. </p>
<p>But just as lower borrowing costs aid the world’s economies, the IMF
warned, the need to contain enormous government deficits will likely put
a brake on growth. The overall world economy is expected to grow 3.2% in
both 2024 and 2025, down a tick from 3.3% last year. That’s an
unimpressive standard: From 2000 through 2019, before the pandemic
upended economic activity, global growth had averaged 3.8% a year. </p>
<p>The IMF also continues to express concern that geopolitical tension,
including antagonism between the United States and China, could make
world trade less efficient. The concern is that more countries would
increasingly do business with their allies instead of seeking the
lowest-priced or best-made foreign goods. Still, global trade, measured
by volume, is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2025,
improving on 2023’s anemic 0.8% increase. </p>
<p>India’s economy is expected to 7% this year and 6.5% in 2025. While
still strong, that pace would be down from 8.2% growth last year, a
result of consumers slowing their spending after a post-pandemic
boom. </p>
<p>The IMF predicts that Japan’s economy, hurt by production problems in
the auto industry and a slowdown in tourism, will expand by a meager
0.3% this year before accelerating to 1.1% growth in 2025. </p>
<p>The United Kingdom is projected to register 1.1% growth this year, up
from a dismal 0.3% in 2023, with falling interest rates helping spur
stronger consumer spending.</p>

<h2 id="us-european-economies-diverge-after-pandemic-as-war-rages">US,
European economies diverge after pandemic as war rages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy is showing resilience after bouncing
back from the COVID-19 pandemic but the eurozone’s prospects are
gloomier due to recent crises and deeper problems, according to IMF
forecasts released Tuesday.</p>
<p>In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the International
Monetary Fund revised its 2025 eurozone growth forecast down from 1.5%
in July to 1.2% as challenges in manufacturing bog down countries such
as Germany.</p>
<p>In contrast, the world’s biggest economy is anticipated to grow 2.2%
next year.</p>
<p>The United States and eurozone have seen their paths diverge over the
past two years, with the U.S. economy logging 2.9% growth in 2023,
significantly above the eurozone’s 0.4%, IMF figures show.</p>
<p>The fund expects the U.S. economy to expand by 2.8% in 2024, again
higher than the euro area’s 0.8% growth forecast.</p>
<p>This is because “Europe has experienced two shocks, while the United
States has only experienced one,” EY chief economist Gregory Daco told
AFP.</p>
<p>After rebounding from the pandemic, which led to historic recessions
around the world, European countries took a hit from the effects of
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>This once again sharply raised energy prices and snarled supply
chains in the region, with the United States experiencing less of an
impact given its distance from the conflict and greater energy
independence.</p>
<p>Germany stalls</p>
<p>In particular, the war has made a significant impact on the
eurozone’s biggest economy — Germany — which saw its economy shrink in
2023.</p>
<p>The German economy is set to see no growth this year, only expanding
0.8% in 2025, said the IMF’s latest report.</p>
<p>The 2025 figure was revised down from July’s projection of 1.3%
growth.</p>
<p>“Persistent weakness in manufacturing weighs on growth for countries
such as Germany and Italy,” said the IMF.</p>
<p>Although Italy’s domestic demand is set to benefit from a European
Union-financed recovery plan, “Germany is experiencing strain from
fiscal consolidation and a sharp decline in real estate prices,” the
fund said.</p>
<p>But it noted that “in the euro area, growth seems to have reached its
lowest point in 2023.”</p>
<p>France, the second-biggest EU economy, is projected to post modest
growth of 1.1% for this year and the next.</p>
<p>US advantages</p>
<p>Daco of EY said the United States benefits from more favorable
structural factors: “In view of its population growth, investment rate
and productivity, it has growth prospects that are double those of
Europe.”</p>
<p>He pointed to a younger U.S. population and greater
competitiveness.</p>
<p>Other factors include Washington’s support for households and
businesses during the pandemic, which have helped to prop up
consumption.</p>
<p>Funds from the government’s CHIPS and Science Act as well as
Inflation Reduction Act — to boost domestic semiconductor and clean
energy industries, respectively — are also stimulating the economy, he
said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Europe is struggling to contend with these major
initiatives.</p>
<p>A report by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi,
unveiled in September, aims to limit Europe’s economic gap with the
United States.</p>
<p>“It is crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious
structural policies, on Mario Draghi’s proposals for enhancing European
competitiveness,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde last
Thursday.</p>

The Supreme Court yesterday agreed to take on a handful of cases that

challenges to national EPA rules must go through the D.C. Court of

higher rates than the general electorate in key swing states like
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Nevada. The one exception EVP found is
Georgia, where climate voters are underperforming in early voting.
“Early voting is not predictive of overall turnout, and so I never get
too excited or too despondent from the data,” EVP founder and executive
director Nathaniel Stinnett told Heatmap. “But what we can see is that
in 18 of our 19 states, people who list climate as their number-one
priority are early voting at a higher rate than the overall electorate,

id="lower-priced-new-cars-are-gaining-popularity-and-not-just-for-cash-poor-buyers">Lower-priced
new cars are gaining popularity, and not just for cash-poor buyers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Detroit — Had she wanted to, Michelle Chumley could have afforded a
pricey new SUV loaded with options. But when it came time to replace her
Chevrolet Blazer SUV, for which she’d paid about $40,000 three years
ago, Chumley chose something smaller. And less costly.  </p>
<p>With her purchase of a Chevrolet Trax compact SUV in June, Chumley
joined a rising number of buyers who have made vehicles in the
below-average $20,000-to-$30,000 range the fastest-growing segment of
the nation’s new-auto market.  </p>
<p>“I just don’t need that big vehicle and to be paying all of that gas
money,” said Chumley, a 56-year-old nurse who lives outside Oxford,
Ohio, near Cincinnati.  </p>
<p>Across the industry, auto analysts say, an “affordability shift” is
taking root. The trend is being led by people who feel they can no
longer afford a new vehicle that would cost them roughly today’s average
selling price of more than $47,000 — a jump of more than 20% from the
pre-pandemic average.  </p>
<p>To buy a new car at that price, an average buyer would have to spend
$737 a month, if financed at today’s average loan rate of 7.1%, for just
under six years before the vehicle would be paid off, according to
Edmunds.com, an auto research and pricing site. For many, that is
financially out of reach.  </p>
<p>Yet there are other buyers who, like Chumley, could manage the
financial burden but have decided it just isn’t worth the cost. And the
trend is forcing America’s automakers to reassess their sales and
production strategies. With buyers confronting inflated prices and
still-high loan rates, sales of new U.S. autos rose only 1% through
September over the same period last year. If the trend toward
lower-priced vehicles proves a lasting one, more generous discounts
could lead to lower average auto prices and slowing industry profits.
 </p>
<p>“Consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic
uncertainty, still-high interest rates and vehicle prices that remain
elevated,” said Kevin Roberts, director of market intelligence at
CarGurus, an automotive shopping site. “This year, all of the growth is
happening in what we would consider the more affordable price buckets.”
 </p>
<p>Under pressure to unload their more expensive models, automakers have
been lowering the sales prices on many such vehicles, largely by
offering steeper discounts. In the past year, the average incentive per
auto has nearly doubled, to $1,812, according to Edmunds. General Motors
has said it expects its average selling price to drop 1.5% in the second
half of the year.  </p>
<p>Through September, Roberts has calculated, new-vehicle sales to
individual buyers, excluding sales to rental companies and other
commercial fleets, are up 7%. Of that growth, 43% came in the
$20,000-to-$30,000 price range — the largest share for that price
category in at least four years. (For used vehicles, the shift is even
more pronounced: 59% sales growth in the $15,000-to-$20,000 price range
over that period.)  </p>
<p>Sales of compact and subcompact cars and SUVs from mainstream auto
brands are growing faster than in any year since 2018, according to data
from Cox Automotive.  </p>
<p>The sales gains for affordable vehicles is, in some ways, a return to
a pattern that existed before the pandemic. As recently as 2018, compact
and subcompact vehicles — typically among the most popular moderately
priced vehicles — had accounted for nearly 35% of the nation’s new
vehicle sales.  </p>
<p>The proportion started to fall in 2020, when the pandemic caused a
global shortage of computer chips that forced automakers to slow
production and allocate scarce semiconductors to more expensive trucks
and large SUVs. As buyers increasingly embraced those higher-priced
vehicles, the companies posted robust earnings growth.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, they deemed profit margins for lower-prices cars too
meager to justify significant production of them. By 2022, the market
share of compact and subcompact vehicles had dropped below 30%.  </p>
<p>This year, that share has rebounded to nearly 34% and rising. Sales
of compact sedans were up 16.7% through September from 12 months
earlier. By contrast, CarGurus said, big pickups rose just under 6%.
Sales of large SUVs are barely up at all — less than 1%.  </p>
<p>Ford’s F-Series truck remains the top-selling vehicle in the United
States this year, as it has been for nearly a half-century, followed by
the Chevrolet Silverado. But Stellantis’ Ram pickup, typically No. 3,
dropped to sixth place, outpaced by several less expensive small SUVs:
the Toyota RAV4, the Honda CR-V and the Tesla Model Y (with a $7,500
U.S. tax credit).  </p>
<p>The move in buyer sentiment toward affordability came fast this year,
catching many automakers off guard, with too-few vehicles available in
lower price ranges. One reason for the shift, analysts say, is that many
buyers who are willing to plunk down nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle
had already done so in the past few years. People who are less able — or
less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their
existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them.
And most of them seem disinclined to spend more than they have to.  </p>
<p>With loan rates still high and average auto insurance prices up a
whopping 38% in the past two years, “the public just wants to be a
little more frugal about it,” said Keith McCluskey, CEO of the
dealership where Chumley bought her Trax.  </p>
<p>Roberts of CarGurus noted that even many higher-income buyers are
choosing smaller, lower-priced vehicles, in some cases because of
uncertainties over the economy and the impending presidential election.
 </p>
<p>The shift has left some automakers overstocked with too many pricier
trucks and SUVs. Some, like Stellantis, which makes Chrysler, Jeep and
Ram vehicles, have warned that the shift will eat into their
profitability this year.  </p>
<p>At General Motors’ Chevrolet brand, executives had foreseen the shift
away from “uber expensive” vehicles and were prepared with the
redesigned Trax, which came out in the spring of 2023, noted Mike
MacPhee, director of Chevrolet sales operations.  </p>
<p>Trax sales in the U.S. so far this year are up 130%, making it the
nation’s top-selling subcompact SUV.  </p>
<p>“We’re basically doubling our (Trax) sales volume from last year,”
MacPhee said.   </p>
<p>How long the preference for lower-priced vehicles may last is
unclear. Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive, notes
that the succession of expected interest rates cuts by the Federal Rates
should eventually lead to lower auto loan rates, thereby making larger
vehicles more affordable.  </p>
<p>“The trends will probably start to change if these interest rates
start coming down,” Chesbrough predicted. “We’ll see consumers start
moving into these larger vehicles.”</p>

exporters race to ship soybeans as looming election stokes tariff
worries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicagp — U.S. soybean export premiums are at their highest in 14
months, as grain merchants race to ship out a record-large U.S. harvest
ahead of the U.S. presidential election and fears of renewed trade
tensions with top importer China, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Nearly 2.5 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans were inspected for
export last week, including almost 1.7 million tons bound for China, the
most in a year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data
released on Monday.</p>
<p>But while this export flurry is a bright spot for U.S. farmers coping
with low prices and hefty supplies, sellers say such heightened export
demand could be short lived — leaving the U.S. with a glut of oilseeds
at a time when prices are hovering near four-year lows.</p>
<p>Tariff threats from presidential hopeful Donald Trump’s campaign
speeches are prompting some Chinese importers to shun U.S. shipments
from January onward, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Instead, these buyers are booking Brazilian soy - and paying up to 40
cents a bushel more than they would in the United States in an
earlier-than-normal seasonal shift that’s shrinking the U.S. export
window.</p>
<p>“The Chinese don’t know what final costs will be relative to tariffs.
They are avoiding the United States from January forward,” said Dan
Basse, president of AgResource Co.</p>
<p>Basse said he expects 2024/25 U.S. exports to fall 75 million bushels
short of the latest USDA forecast.</p>
<p>How China will respond to tariffs under a new U.S. administration is
unclear. Trump has vowed to boost tariffs on Chinese products to around
60%, while challenger Kamala Harris’ plan is to keep tariffs roughly as
they are now.</p>
<p>“There’s a threat of tariffs from either party, but more so under a
Trump administration,” said Terry Reilly, senior agricultural strategist
with Marex. “With Harris, there’s a real possibility that things will
revert to the status quo.”</p>
<p>Traders said premiums for immediate shipments of U.S. soy are likely
to erode in the coming weeks as near-term demand is met and if trade war
concerns limit new buying by China.</p>
<p>Cash premiums for soybean barges delivered to Gulf export terminals
by midweek spiked to a 130-cent premium over Chicago Board of Trade
November SX24 futures on Monday, reflecting strong demand for immediate
supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>The same soybeans, if loaded next month, were available for 27 cents
a bushel less, or a savings of roughly $14,000 per fully loaded
1,500-ton barge.</p>

id="three-mile-island-nuclear-plant-gears-up-for-big-tech-reboot">Three
Mile Island nuclear plant gears up for Big Tech reboot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>THREE MILE ISLAND, Pennsylvania — Giant cooling towers at
Constellation Energy’s CEG.OThree Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania have sat dormant for so long that grass has sprung up in
the towers’ hollowed-out bases and wildlife roam inside.</p>
<p>Armed guard stations at an entrance to the shut concrete facility,
surrounded by barbed wire, sit empty. The plant, which would run so loud
when operating that workers were required to wear hearing protection, is
nearly silent.</p>
<p>“It’s still eerie walking in here and it’s, just, quiet,”
Constellation regulatory assurance manager Craig Smith said during a
tour of the plant last week. Smith, who worked at Three Mile Island when
Constellation shut the site’s remaining reactor in 2019, is now
preparing for a restart.</p>
<p>Constellation announced last month that it would revive the
half-century-old Three Mile Island with the purpose of fueling
Microsoft’s MSFT.O data centers. Microsoft is expected to pay at least
$100 a megawatt-hour, nearly double the typical cost of renewable energy
in the region, as part of the 20-year power contract.</p>
<p>The agreement shows the dramatic lengths Big Tech is willing to go to
procure electricity for its artificial intelligence expansion and the
undertaking by the U.S. power industry to meet that demand.</p>
<p>The effort to restore Unit 1 at Three Mile Island is expected to take
four years, at least $1.6 billion, and thousands of workers to complete
the unprecedented task of restarting a retired nuclear plant.</p>
<p>Constellation has already ordered costly equipment for the site and
identified fuel for the unit’s reactor core, with work expected to start
early next year, according to Reuters’ interviews with company
executives, contractors and a tour of the site.</p>
<p>Successfully resurrecting Three Mile Island, which is widely known
for a 1979 partial meltdown that cast a pall over the U.S. nuclear
sector for decades, would put the plant at the front edge of an industry
revival.</p>
<p>Nuclear creates large amounts of carbon-free electricity. That is
attractive to companies, like Microsoft, that have climate pledges and
face increasing public scrutiny for their voracious power use.</p>
<p>Microsoft would consider signing other power purchase agreements to
restart shut plants, Alistair Speirs, senior director of Microsoft’s
Azure Global Infrastructure, told Reuters.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anything’s off the table,” Speirs said.</p>
<p>Relaunching Three Mile Island would supply to the regional grid 835
megawatts of electricity - enough for all of Philadelphia’s homes - to
help offset Microsoft’s power consumption.</p>
<p>A restart of the plant, however, is not certain. Three Mile Island,
which will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Complex, still requires
licensing modifications and permitting. Local activists have also vowed
to fight the project over safety and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>If the plan suffers the same lengthy delays and cost overruns that
have plagued nearly every nuclear build in the country’s history, it
could stymie other deals and set back Big Tech’s quest to rapidly
expand, power experts say.</p>
<p>Millions of feet of building</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Constellation finished initial testing of the
plant’s Unit 1 to determine whether it was financially reasonable to
resurrect it.</p>
<p>After learning that the central generator, which would cost hundreds
of millions of dollars to replace, was in strong condition, the company
moved ahead with its plan.</p>
<p>“We have a perfectly ready-to-go main generator just waiting for the
rest of the plant to get started,” said Smith, standing in front of a
row of massive turbines.</p>
<p>About a thousand carpenters, electricians, pipefitters and other
tradesmen are expected to be deployed to the site, said Rob Bair,
president of Pennsylvania Building Trades.</p>
<p>Work will likely start in the first quarter of 2025 with restoring
two 370-foot (113-m) high cooling towers, which were stripped bare after
the plant shut.</p>
<p>“There is a ton of equipment that has to go back in those towers,”
said Bair, whose father helped build Unit 1, which opened in 1974.</p>
<p>Workers will be hoisted up the top of the towers to install lighting
and restock the buildings from within. The structures’ bases, which were
once made of redwood, will be refurbished with modern materials.</p>
<p>Next, restorations inside of the plant will begin: some major
equipment will be replaced. Constellation recently ordered the site’s
main transformer, which is expected to cost around $100 million
including installation, to be delivered in 2027.</p>
<p>Piping and electrical work, scrubbing condensers and cleaning out
power generators, will be among the next tasks. A million-gallon tank
will be filled with water.</p>
<p>Much of the analog control room, with a panel installed in the early
1970s, will stay the same. A benefit of keeping the analog system is
that it would be more secure against cyberattacks, officials said.</p>
<p>Completing the job will require several million feet of scaffolding,
built by scaffologists, or carpenters with special licenses, to be
assembled repeatedly around the island.</p>
<p>“And all of that has to be done before you can even put fuel on the
site,” Bair said.</p>
<p>The company has commissioned the fuel design for the reactor’s core,
said Constellation Chief Generation Officer Bryan Hanson. The core holds
the enriched uranium, the fuel source for the plant, stacked in pellets
and sealed in tubes.</p>
<p>Constellation, which is the biggest U.S. operator of nuclear plants,
will tap into fuel from its existing enriched uranium reserves as one of
the final steps before starting up.</p>
<p>The effort is part of a recent turnaround of U.S. nuclear power,
which suffered from competition from cheap fuel and fears of meltdowns,
said John Ciampaglia, CEO of Sprott Asset Management, which manages a
large physical uranium fund.</p>
<p>In Michigan, Holtec is in the process of trying to restart another
reactor site.</p>
<p>Constellation’s stock price has soared by 135% so far this year amid
fresh projections for record U.S. power consumption next year and a
doubling of data center demand by 2030.</p>
<p>Not everyone is enthused about the prospect of a nuclear comeback.
The power plants produce waste that can remain radioactive for thousands
of years.</p>
<p>About a tennis court-size amount of spent nuclear fuel from Unit 1 is
stored on Three Mile Island, which sits on a strip of land in the
Susquehanna River. The decommissioning of Unit 2 is still underway about
45 years after the partial meltdown.</p>
<p>Local activist Eric Epstein, who remembers the March 1979 incident,
said he will fight Constellation’s request to resume operating and water
use licenses.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a protracted battle,” Epstein said.</p>
<p>The first chance for the challenges comes on Oct. 25, when the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission has scheduled its initial public hearing
on Constellation’s plan to restart Unit 1.</p>

id="russian-state-media-flatters-trump-but-kremlin-cool-on-him-and-harris">Russian
state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — Russian officials from President Vladimir Putin down say it
makes no difference to Moscow who wins the White House on November
5.</p>
<p>Yet anyone watching Kremlin-guided state media coverage of the U.S.
election would conclude Donald Trump is strongly favored.</p>
<p>State TV’s main Channel One news program this month showed video of
billionaire Elon Musk and TV host Tucker Carlson denigrating Democratic
candidate Kamala Harris before zooming in on what it cast as a series of
stumbling performances.</p>
<p>Harris’ tendency to burst into fits of laughter, something Putin
himself spoke about sarcastically last month, has featured prominently
in broadcasts and state TV has played compilations of her least eloquent
statements during the campaign.</p>
<p>By contrast, the same Channel One report portrayed Trump and running
mate JD Vance as sure-footed and imbued with common sense on everything
from transgender politics to immigration, but facing sinister forces as
evidenced by assassination plots.</p>
<p>The Kremlin says the choice of who becomes the next U.S. president is
a matter exclusively for the American people to decide and that it will
work with whoever is elected.</p>
<p>It has denied steering coverage, although some former state media
employees have spoken publicly about weekly Kremlin meetings at which
guidance on different issues is given.</p>
<p>The state media’s apparent preference for Trump may be no
surprise.</p>
<p>Trump has been far less openly supportive of Ukraine in its war
against Russia than incumbent President Joe Biden or Harris, raising
fears in Kyiv that it could lose its most important ally if he wins.</p>
<p>Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin over the years and boasted of
having a good working relationship, last week blamed Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskiy for helping start the war.</p>
<p>This month he declined to confirm reports he had spoken to Putin on
several occasions since leaving office in 2021 saying only: “If I did,
it’s a smart thing.”</p>
<p>Harris by contrast has called Putin “a murderous dictator,” vowed to
continue backing Ukraine, and said that opposition politician Alexei
Navalny’s death in prison was “a further sign of Putin’s brutality.” The
Kremlin has denied any hand in Navalny’s demise.</p>
<p>State TV has often showcased guest speakers on its prime time
geopolitical talk shows who express a preference for Trump, even if
their reasons sometimes vary.</p>
<p>Andrei Sidorov, a senior academic at Moscow State University, told a
major state TV talk show in October that Trump would be better for
Russia because he would stir division that could trigger a long-held
fantasy of anti-Western Russian hawks - the disintegration of the United
States during infighting between its constituent states.</p>
<p>“I am for Trump. I was always for Trump - he’s a destroyer. If he’s
elected … then civil war will really be on the agenda,” Sidorov said,
forecasting a Democratic win would see the same “crap” as now,
continuing.</p>
<p>“(But) Trump could really lead to our geopolitical adversary
collapsing without any missiles being fired.”</p>
<p>A 2017 U.S. intelligence report said Putin had directed a
sophisticated influence campaign to denigrate Democratic candidate
Hillary Clinton and support Trump in the 2016 race for the White House.
The Kremlin denied meddling and Trump denied any collusion with Russia
during that campaign.</p>
<p>Despite the two current candidates’ different approaches to Moscow,
some Russian officials - who are navigating the worst period in
U.S.-Russia relations since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis - have
expressed wariness of both.</p>
<p>Harris, they say, would mean a continuation of what Moscow sees as
Biden’s proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian.”</p>
<p>Trump, who raised hopes in Moscow of better ties before he took
office in 2017, is remembered for imposing sanctions when in the White
House despite warm words about Putin. In Moscow’s eyes, he appeared
boxed in on Russia policy by the wider U.S. political establishment.</p>
<p>“I have no illusions. (When Trump was president) he had several
conversations with President Vladimir Putin. He received me at the White
House a couple of times. He was friendly,” Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov recalled in September.</p>
<p>“But sanctions against the Russian Federation were imposed under
President Trump on a regular basis. As a result, we concluded that we
need to rely on ourselves. We will never in our history count on ‘a good
guy’ getting into the White House.”</p>
<p>One senior Russian source said there were different views at top
levels of the Kremlin about Trump, but confirmed some believed a Trump
victory might not go well for Moscow.</p>
<p>“Look what happened last time he became president. Everyone said
beforehand that U.S.-Russia relations would benefit, but they ended up
even worse. Trump says a lot of things but doesn’t always do what he
says,” said the source, who declined to be named given the matter’s
sensitivity.</p>
<p>The same source questioned whether Trump’s purported reluctance to
keep financing and arming Ukraine and his talk of being able to end the
war swiftly would survive lobbying efforts from powerful U.S. factions
who argue that Ukraine’s fate is existential for the West and that Kyiv
must not lose.</p>
<p>A second senior source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Moscow was not expecting much from either candidate. Trump had been
“pretty tough” on Moscow when in power, was worryingly impulsive and had
tough views on Russia’s ally China, he said.</p>
<p>The source added that he did not expect to see big change in
Moscow-Washington relations whoever was elected.</p>
<p>“Neither Trump nor Harris are going to change the relationship with
Russia fundamentally. There is not going to be some great new
friendship,” said the source.</p>
<p>“The West views Russia and China as bad and the West as good and it
is hard to see any leader changing a belief that is now ingrained within
the Washington elite.”</p>

in custody after 5 found dead in shooting at home in Washington
state</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FALL CITY, WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officials found five people
killed in a shooting inside a home southeast of Seattle on Monday
morning and took a teenager into custody, police said.</p>
<p>Several people called 911 around 5 a.m. to report a shooting in Fall
City, Washington, King County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Mike Mellis
said at a media briefing Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Arriving deputies immediately took one teen into custody while
another teenager who had been hurt was taken to a Seattle hospital,
Mellis said. Both teens live at the house, Mellis said.</p>
<p>Deputies entering the home found the bodies of five people, he said.
Two were adults and three were described by Mellis as young teenagers.
No names have been released yet.</p>
<p>“Once bodies were discovered, clearly we understand that this is a
hugely significant crime scene,” he said.</p>
<p>Mellis said the shooting appears to involve members of a family, but
added that they didn’t yet know how they were related. He also said
there was no ongoing threat to the community.</p>
<p>“I have no reason to think that there will be any additional
arrests,” he said.</p>
<p>The teen in custody was booked into King County’s juvenile detention
facility, according to Mellis. The teen will appear in court for a first
hearing on Tuesday or Wednesday, a spokesperson for the county
Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said in an email.</p>
<p>A neighbor told KING-TV that a couple and their five children lived
in the home.</p>
<p>“I’m just in total shock, I keep bursting into tears,” Lynne Trowern,
told the news outlet.</p>
<p>An emailed statement Monday evening from King County Councilmember
Sarah Perry said the shooting involved a family of seven people.</p>
<p>Sheriff Patricia Cole-Tindall told KING-TV that she was “very sad,
very disturbed” to learn about the shooting.</p>

urges probe into killings of two Mozambique opposition figures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. government on Monday condemned the weekend
killings by gunmen of two Mozambique opposition figures ahead of
protests against a disputed election result, with Washington urging “a
swift and thorough investigation into the murders.”</p>
<p>Why it’s important</p>
<p>The United States is the largest bilateral donor to Mozambique,
providing over $560 million in assistance annually, according to the
U.S. State Department website.</p>
<p>Washington joined the European Union and Mozambique’s former colonial
ruler Portugal in the condemnation and the call for an investigation
into the murders of opposition lawyer Elvino Dias and opposition party
official Paulo Guambe on Saturday after multiple rounds were fired at a
car in which they were travelling.</p>
<p>Key quotes</p>
<p>“The United States condemns the killings of lawyer Elvino Dias and
Podemos parliamentary candidate Paulo Guambe in Mozambique,” the U.S.
State Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We join the calls made by all four of Mozambique’s national
political parties in urging a swift and thorough investigation.”</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>Mozambique police on Monday fired teargas and bullets at protesters
in the capital Maputo who had gathered at the scene where the two
opposition party figures were shot dead on Saturday after a disputed
election.</p>
<p>The full results of Mozambique’s Oct. 9 national election are
expected this week, with early results showing that the ruling party
Frelimo is set for another win. Opposition candidates say the poll was
rigged.</p>
<p>Frelimo has ruled the southern African country since 1975 and has
been accused of electoral fraud by opposition leaders, civil society and
election observers. It denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The State Department urged Mozambique’s state institutions, political
leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes
peacefully and lawfully while rejecting violence and inflammatory
rhetoric.</p>

endorsements play outsized role in US presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Across the country, about 14 million voters are members of unions -
workers’ organizations formed to protect their rights. But even though
union members make up a small part of the American electorate,
presidential candidates eagerly seek their endorsement. VOA’s
Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson reports from Nevada, where
unions have a powerful voice in this year’s presidential election.</p>

rails at Hong Kong efforts to block US-based content</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A leading U.S. Democrat on China policy has called on an
American web hosting company not to comply with requests from Hong Kong
authorities to suspend the website of a media service founded by
overseas Hong Kong democracy activists.</p>
<p>Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House
Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), wrote to web
services company Automattic on Monday to ensure the webpage belonging to
Flow HK, an online media outlet founded by Hong Kong pro-democracy
activists who are in exile, remains operational despite pressure from
the Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, VOA revealed Flow HK to be the first
overseas Hong Kong media website to be officially blocked within Hong
Kong, but recent requests to remove the website internationally brought
the original censorship inside China to a deeper level.</p>
<p>In the original notice, Hong Kong police requested that Flow HK’s
website be removed for allegedly violating the Hong Kong National
Security Law by promoting secessionism, subverting state power and
colluding with foreign forces.</p>
<p>Automattic has not complied with these requests, a decision that
Krishnamoorthi praises as “the correct choice,” in a letter exclusively
obtained by VOA.</p>
<p>“Hong Kong’s effort to use its National Security Law to
extraterritorially remove lawful content in the United States is
unacceptable, and American companies should not help facilitate such
repression,” the lawmaker said in his letter.</p>
<p>‘Crystal clear’ opposition</p>
<p>Krishnamoorthi expressed concern about what he sees as an increasing
tendency of Chinese officials attempting to censor detractors
abroad.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time the CCP has tried to use Hong Kong’s
National Security Law to target overseas pro-democracy activists, and it
won’t be the last. Bounties have been placed on activists, even
Americans,” Krishnamoorthi told VOA.</p>
<p>“Congress must be crystal clear that we will not tolerate the CCP
using its laws to target overseas activists, including their websites
hosted here in America,” he added.</p>
<p>Carmen Lau, international advocacy and program associate at the
Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, said the Hong Kong
government is more frequently using its security laws in this manner to
target people outside China.</p>
<p>“FlowHK goes beyond just reporting news; it plays a unique role in
documenting and discussing social issues,” Lau wrote to VOA. She added
that the behavior of the Hong Kong government “clearly signals that the
crackdown on free speech and freedom of expression is accelerating,
extending beyond borders to suppress the free speech of dissidents and
the diaspora.”</p>
<p>Flow HK was founded in early 2021 by social activists expelled from
Hong Kong. “In the face of unprecedented historical trials, it explains
on its website, “we who are scattered across the world are determined to
maintain this unique community of Hong Kong people and pass on the flame
of resistance.”</p>
<p>Hong Kong has internally blocked several websites related to the
protests, including the Hong Kong Chronicles, which contains personal
information on some Hong Kong police officers; the Washington-based Hong
Kong Democracy Council; the British human rights organization Hong Kong
Watch; Taiwan’s Transitional Justice Commission; the 2021 Hong Kong
Charter, composed of Hong Kong exiles; and the June 4th Memorial
Museum.</p>
<p>Automattic, a technology company headquartered in San Francisco,
provides web content management services in 92 countries and has 1,730
employees. According to its website, the company provides services for
many well-known websites, social networking sites and apps, including
WordPress.com, WordPress VIP, Woo, Simplenote, Newspack and Tumblr.</p>
<p>VOA requested comments from Automattic, the Hong Kong police and Flow
HK but did not receive responses by the time of publication.</p>

id="central-park-5-sue-trump-for-jogger-case-remarks-at-debate">Central
Park 5 sue Trump for jogger case remarks at debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The men formerly known as the Central Park Five before they were
exonerated filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against Republican
presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>
<p>With Election Day two weeks away, the group accused the former
president of making “false and defamatory statements” about them during
last month’s presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. The
group is asking for a jury trial to determine compensatory and punitive
damages.</p>
<p>“Defendant Trump falsely stated that plaintiffs killed an individual
and pled guilty to the crime. These statements are demonstrably false,”
the group wrote in the federal complaint.</p>
<p>The men are upset because Trump essentially “defamed them in front of
67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names
all over again,” co-lead counsel Shanin Specter told The Associated
Press in an email.</p>
<p>Specter had no comment when asked if there were concerns some see the
lawsuit as purely political because of the group’s support for Harris.
“We are seeking redress in the courts,” Specter said.</p>
<p>Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung decried the suit as “just another
frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing
activists, in an attempt to distract the American people from Kamala
Harris’s dangerously liberal agenda and failing campaign.”</p>
<p>Trump campaign officials did not immediately respond to emails
seeking comment.</p>
<p>Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and
Korey Wise were teenagers when they were accused of the 1989 rape and
beating of a white woman jogger in New York City’s Central Park. The
five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under
duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were
later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in
2002 after another person confessed to the crime.</p>
<p>After the crime, Trump purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times
calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. At the time, many in
New York believed Trump’s ad was akin to calling for the teens to be
executed. The jogger case was Trump’s first foray into tough-on-crime
politics that preluded his full-throated populist political persona.
Since then, dog whistles and overtly racist rhetoric have been fixtures
of Trump’s public life.</p>
<p>In the Sept. 10 debate, Trump misstated key facts of the case when
Harris brought up the matter.</p>
<p>“They admitted, they said they pled guilty, and I said, ’well, if
they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately …
And they pled guilty, then they pled not guilty,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He appeared to be confusing guilty pleas with confessions. Also, no
victim died.</p>
<p>The now Exonerated Five, including Salaam, who is now a New York City
councilman, have been campaigning for Harris. Some of them spoke at the
Democratic National Convention in August, calling out Trump for never
apologizing for the newspaper ad.</p>
<p>They have also joined civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton for a
get-out-the-vote bus tour.</p>
<p>Prior defamation suits involving Trump have led to sizable amounts
awarded to the plaintiffs. In January, a jury awarded $83.3 million to
advice columnist E. Jean Carroll over Trump’s continued social media
attacks against her claims he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan
department store in 1996. In May 2023, a jury found Trump liable for
sexually abusing her and issued a $5 million judgement.</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-cohen-appeal-in-lawsuit-against-trump">Supreme
Court rejects Cohen appeal in lawsuit against Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Supreme Court rejected an appeal Monday from Michael
Cohen, who wanted to hold his ex-boss, former President Donald Trump,
liable for a jailing he said was retaliation for writing a tell-all
memoir.</p>
<p>The justices did not detail their reasoning in the brief, a routine
order released just over two weeks before Election Day, when Trump is
running for another term.</p>
<p>Cohen had asked the high court to revive a lawsuit tossed out by
lower courts. Those judges found the law doesn’t generally allow people
to seek damages over claims they were jailed for criticizing a
president, and that the situation had been dealt with when Cohen was
released from custody.</p>
<p>Cohen’s attorney, Jon-Michael Dougherty, said the ruling “signals a
dangerous moment in American democracy” and raises questions about
free-speech rights.</p>
<p>Trump attorney Alina Habba said the Supreme Court had correctly
denied Cohen’s petition, and “he must finally abandon his frivolous and
desperate claims.”</p>
<p>Cohen filed the lawsuit after his early release from prison was
quickly reversed.</p>
<p>Cohen was serving time after pleading guilty in 2018 to charges
connected in part to the payment of hush money to porn actor Stormy
Daniels to avoid damage to Trump’s 2016 presidential bid.</p>
<p>Cohen said Trump had directed the hush money payment, a contention
that later became a key part of the New York trial in which Trump was
convicted this year. </p>
<p>The former president has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Cohen got a three-year sentence after pleading guilty and had served
more than a year when he was released in 2020 as authorities worked to
contain the coronavirus outbreak in federal prisons.</p>
<p>But he was returned to prison weeks later after authorities contended
he had failed to accept certain terms of his release. Cohen said he had
asked if a condition forbidding him from speaking with the media and
publishing his book could be removed.</p>
<p>He served 16 days in solitary confinement before he was again freed
on the orders of a judge who said he’d been jailed in retaliation for
his desire to publish a book critical of the president and to discuss it
on social media.</p>
<p>Cohen sued Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr, along with
various prison and probation officials.</p>

puts curbs on firms for supporting Iran, Pakistan weapons programs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States added more than two dozen entities to
a trade blacklist Monday over alleged support of weapons and drone
development programs in Iran and Pakistan, and for other issues
including aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. </p>
<p>The 26 targets, mostly in Pakistan, China and the United Arab
Emirates, were said to have violated export controls, been involved in
“weapons programs of concern,” or evaded U.S. sanctions and export
controls on Russia and Iran, the Commerce Department said. </p>
<p>Their addition to the so-called “entity list” restricts them from
getting U.S. items and technologies without government
authorization. </p>
<p>“We are vigilant in defending U.S. national security from bad
actors,” Alan Estevez, undersecretary of commerce for industry and
security, said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Our actions today send a message to malicious actors that if they
violate our controls, they will pay a price,” he added. </p>
<p>Nine entities in Pakistan were accused of being front companies and
procurement agents for the already blacklisted Advanced Engineering
Research Organization. </p>
<p>Since 2010, the group was said to have procured U.S.-origin items by
disguising their end users, who include a Pakistani entity responsible
for the country’s cruise missile and strategic drone program. </p>
<p>“This activity is contrary to the national security and foreign
policy interests of the United States,” the Commerce Department
said. </p>
<p>Six entities in China were added to the list for allegedly acquiring
U.S.-origin items to support China’s military modernization or to aid
Iran ’s weapons and drone programs, among other reasons. </p>
<p>And three entities in the UAE, alongside another in Egypt, were said
to have acquired or attempted to obtain U.S. components to avoid
sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the
department said. </p>
<p>On Monday, the Commerce Department also removed Canada-based Sandvine
from the entity list, after the company took steps to “to address the
misuse of its technology that can undermine human rights.” </p>
<p>The U.S. had placed Sandvine on the trade restriction list in
February 2024 for allegedly helping the Egyptian government target human
rights activists and politicians. </p>
<p>The company had been added “after its products were used to conduct
mass web monitoring and censorship and target human rights activists and
dissidents, including by enabling the misuse of commercial spyware,” the
Commerce Department said.</p>

id="white-house-tour-upgraded-so-visitors-can-see-hear-touch-more">White
House tour upgraded so visitors can see, hear, touch more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Jill Biden unveiled Monday what she says is a reimagined
White House public tour that will engage visitors’ senses to teach them
about the mansion’s history and events that happened there. </p>
<p>New to the tour is the Diplomatic Reception Room, which previously
had been off-limits. This ground-floor room is where President Franklin
D. Roosevelt recorded his “fireside chats.” Snippets of some of those
conversations will now play for visitors. </p>
<p>Tourists will also be able to go into several other ground-floor
rooms that previously were cordoned off at the doorway: the library; the
China Room, which houses the collection of presidential place settings;
and the Vermeil Room, which houses a collection of gold-plated silver
tableware. </p>
<p>There’s also greater access to the East Room and State Dining Room,
and the Red, Blue and Green Rooms, all located on the floor above, known
as the State Floor. </p>
<p>New displays, or reader rails, provide written details about the
rooms, their contents and some of the history that happened there, in
addition to offering experiences that encourage visitors to touch, see
and hear. </p>
<p>For example, the display in the China Room plays a brief loop of some
of the place settings. In the State Dining Room, there’s a replica of a
prayer that’s on the mantel beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln so
people can now read it because they were kept too far away from it. </p>
<p>“As a teacher for 40 years, I know that we all learn in different
ways,” the first lady, who teaches English and writing at a community
college, said Monday at a White House event to mark the unveiling of the
updated tour. People use all of their senses to learn, she said. </p>
<p>“We’ve made replicas so that you can feel the features of some of the
sculpture’s faces and touch the shining fabric on the furniture of the
Blue Room,” she said. “You can now hear President Roosevelt’s ‘fireside
chats’ in the room in which he recorded them, so you can feel as if you
are there right beside him.” </p>
<p>“We’ve added screens and information so you can read about what you
see in each of the rooms, for you visual learners,” Jill Biden
said. </p>
<p>After walking the tour route herself, the first lady decided to
expand it and add more educational and historical content, according to
aides. It had been decades since the tour was last updated. </p>
<p>“The White House tour now lets visitors touch, hear and see their
history up close,” she said Sunday. </p>
<p>Some 10,000 people tour the White House every week. </p>
<p>When they enter through the East Wing, Jill Biden will be there on
video to welcome them, while President Joe Biden will be on video in the
East Room to talk about some of the history that happened there. The
next president, who takes office in January, and his — or her — spouse
can record their own greetings since the changes are meant to carry over
from one administration to the next.  </p>
<p>Collages of printed photos that line the hallway are now digital,
making it easier to change them around, while a new vertical 3D model of
the 18-acre White House campus explains how the executive mansion was
built and expanded over the past 200-plus years. </p>
<p>The first lady’s office has worked on the project for the past two
years with the National Park Service, the White House Curator’s office,
the private, nonprofit White House Historical Association, presidential
libraries and the History Channel, which partnered with ESI Design on
the interactive experiences. </p>
<p>The project was funded by a $5 million gift from the History Channel
to the National Park Service. The White House is a national park.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Arbor Energy might have the flashiest origin story in cleantech.
</p>
<p>
After the company’s CEO, Brad Hartwig, left SpaceX in 2018, he attempted
to craft the ideal resume for a future astronaut, his dream career. He
joined the California Air National Guard, worked as a test pilot at the
now-defunct electric aviation startup Kitty Hawk, and participated in
volunteer search and rescue missions in the Bay Area, which gave him a
front row seat to the devastating effects of wildfires in Northern
California.
</p>
<p>
That experience changed everything. “I decided I actually really like
planet Earth,” Hartwig told me, “and I wanted to focus my career instead
on preserving it, rather than trying to leave it.” So he rallied a bunch
of his former rocket engineer colleagues to repurpose technology they
pioneered at SpaceX to build a biomass-fueled, carbon negative power
source that’s supposedly about ten times smaller, twice as efficient,
and eventually, one-third the cost of the industry standard for this
type of plant.
</p>
<p>
Take that, all you founders humble-bragging about starting in a dingy
garage.
</p>

“It’s not new science, per se,” Hartwig told me. The goal of this type
of tech, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, is to combine
biomass-based energy generation with carbon dioxide removal to achieve
net negative emissions. Sounds like a dream, but actually producing
power or heat from this process has so far proven too expensive to
really make sense. There are
<a href="https://co2re.co/FacilityData" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only
a few</u></a> so-called BECCS facilities operating in the U.S. today,
and they’re all just ethanol fuel refineries with carbon capture and
storage technology tacked on.
</p>
<p>
But the advances in 3D printing and computer modeling that allowed the
SpaceX team to build an increasingly
<a href="https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1819772716339339664/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>simple
and cheap rocket engine</u></a> have allowed Arbor to move quickly into
this new market, Hartwig explained. “A lot of the technology that we had
really pioneered over the last decade — in reactor design, combustion
devices, turbo machinery, all for rocket propulsion — all that
technology has really quite immediate application in this space of
biomass conversion and power generation.”
</p>
<p>
Arbor’s method is poised to be a whole lot sleeker and cheaper than the
BECCS plants of today, enabling both more carbon sequestration and
actual electricity production, all by utilizing what Hartwig fondly
refers to as a “vegetarian rocket engine.” Because there’s no air in
space, astronauts have to bring pure oxygen onboard, which the rocket
engines use to burn fuel and propel themselves into the stratosphere and
beyond. Arbor simply subs out the rocket fuel for biomass. When that
biomass is combusted with pure oxygen, the resulting exhaust consists of
just CO2 and water. As the exhaust cools, the water condenses out, and
what’s left is a stream of pure carbon dioxide that’s ready to be
injected deep underground for permanent storage. All of the energy
required to operate Arbor’s system is generated by the biomass
combustion itself.
</p>
<p>
“Arbor is the first to bring forward a technology that can provide clean
baseload energy in a very compact form,” Clea Kolster, a partner and
Head of Science at Lowercarbon Capital told me. Lowercarbon is an
investor in Arbor, alongside other climate tech-focused venture capital
firms including Gigascale Capital and Voyager Ventures, but the company
has not yet disclosed how much it’s raised.
</p>
<p>
Last month, Arbor
<a href="https://arbor.co/perspectives/microsoft-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a deal with Microsoft</u></a> to deliver 25,000 tons of permanent carbon
dioxide removal to the tech giant starting in 2027, when the startup’s
first commercial project is expected to come online. As a part of the
deal, Arbor will also generate 5 megawatts of clean electricity per
year, enough to power about 4,000 U.S. homes. And just a few days ago,
the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/doe-invests-58-million-tackle-climate-change-removing-carbon-atmosphere" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy announced</u></a> that Arbor is one of 11 projects to receive
a combined total of $58.5 million to help develop the domestic carbon
removal industry.
</p>
<p>
Arbor’s current plan is to source biomass from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>forestry
waste</u></a>, much of which is generated by forest thinning operations
intended to prevent destructive wildfires. Hartwig told me that for
every ton of organic waste, Arbor can produce about one megawatt hour of
electricity, which is in line with
<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1409/ML14093A260.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>current
efficiency standards</u></a>, plus about 1.8 tons of carbon removal. “We
look at being as efficient, if not a little more efficient than a
traditional bioenergy power plant that does not have carbon capture on
it,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
The company’s carbon removal price targets are also extremely
competitive — in the $50 to $100 per ton range, Hartwig said. Compare
that to something like direct air capture, which today exceeds $600 per
ton, or enhanced rock weathering, which is usually upwards of $300 per
ton. “The power and carbon removal they can offer comes at prices that
meet nearly unlimited demand,”<em> </em>Mike Schroepfer, the founder of
Gigascale Capital and former CTO of Meta, told me via email. Arbor
benefits from the fact that the electricity it produces and sells can
help offset the cost of the carbon removal, and vice versa. So if the
company succeeds in hitting its cost and efficiency targets, Hartwig
said, this “quickly becomes a case for, why wouldn’t you just deploy
these everywhere?”
</p>
<p>
Initial customers will likely be (no surprise here) the Microsofts,
Googles and Metas of the world — hyperscalers with growing data center
needs and ambitious emissions targets. “What Arbor unlocks is basically
the ability for hyperscalers to stop needing to sacrifice their net zero
goals for AI,” Kolster told me. And instead of languishing in the
interminable grid interconnection queue, Hartwig said that providing
power directly to customers could ensure rapid, early deployment. “We
see it as being quicker to power behind-the-meter applications, because
you don’t have to go through the process of connecting to the grid,” he
told me. Long-term though, he said grid connection will be vital, since
Arbor can provide baseload power whereas intermittent renewables cannot.
</p>
<p>
All of this could serve as a much cheaper alternative, to say,
re-opening shuttered nuclear facilities, as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>Microsoft
also recently committed</u></a> to doing at Three Mile Island. “It’s
great, we should be doing that,” Kolster said of this nuclear deal, “but
there’s actually a limited pool of options to do that, and
unfortunately, there is still community pushback.”
</p>
<p>
Currently, Arbor is working to build out its pilot plant in San
Bernardino, California, which Hartwig told me will turn on this
December. And by 2030, the company plans to have its first commercial
plant operating at scale, generating 100 megawatts of electricity while
removing nearly 2 megatons of CO2 every year. “To put it in perspective:
In 2023, the U.S. added roughly 9 gigawatts of gas power to the grid,
which generates 18 to 23 megatons of CO2 a year,” Schroepfer wrote to
me. So having just one Arbor facility removing 2 megatons would make a
real dent. The first plant will be located in Louisiana, where Arbor
will also be working with an as-yet-unnamed partner to do the carbon
storage.
</p>
<p>
The company’s carbon credits will be verified with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/isometric-carbon-credits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">credit
certification platform Isometric</a>, which is also backed by
Lowercarbon and thought to have the most stringent standards in the
industry. Hartwig told me that Arbor worked hand-in-hand with Isometric
to develop the protocol for
“<a href="https://registry.isometric.com/protocol/biogenic-capture-and-storage/1.1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>biogenic
carbon capture and storage</u></a>,” as the company is the first
Isometric-approved supplier to use this standard.
</p>
<p>
But Hartwig also said that government support hasn’t yet caught up to
the tech’s potential. While the Inflation Reduction Act provides direct
air capture companies with $180 per ton of carbon dioxide removed,
technology such as Arbor’s only qualifies for $85 per ton. It’s not
nothing — more than the zero dollars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>enhanced
rock weathering</u></a> companies such as Lithos or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>bio-oil
sequestration companies</u></a> such as Charm are getting. “But at the
same time, we’re treated the same as if we’re sequestering CO2 emissions
from a natural gas plant or a coal plant,” Hartwig told me, as opposed
to getting paid for actual CO2 removal.
</p>
<p>
“I think we are definitely going to need government procurement or
involvement to actually hit one, five, 10 gigatons per year of carbon
removal,” Hartwig said. Globally, scientists estimate that we’ll need
<a href="https://www.wri.org/initiatives/carbon-removal#:~:text=Analysis%20by%20the%20National%20Academy,GtCO2%20per%20year%20by%202100." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up
to 10 </u><u><em><em>giga</em></em></u><u>tons</u></a> of annual CO2
removal by 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
“Even at $100 per ton, 10 gigatons of carbon removal is still a pretty
hefty price tag,” Hartwig told me. A $1 trillion price tag, to be exact.
“We definitely need more players than just Microsoft.”

gears up for election amid Chinese threats, US military buildup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Koror, Palau — Driving toward the center of Palau’s commercial city
of Koror, election yard signs for presidential, senate and house of
delegates’ candidates in this tiny island nation’s November elections
line the street as waves of the pristinely blue Pacific Ocean lap the
shore not far away.</p>
<p>The serenity of the surroundings belies just how high the stakes are
in this year’s elections. Palau sits on the front line of competition
for geopolitical influence between the United States and China in the
Pacific Ocean. And competition between the candidates is tense, leading
some to worry about how winners and losers will respond to the results
once the votes are cast.</p>
<p>“This election is a very critical one and I just hope everything will
end peacefully,” Kaipo Recheungel, a Palauan transportation service
operator, told this reporter as we drove past hotels and bars along main
street.</p>
<p>Palau has some 16,000 registered voters and elections are scheduled
for Nov. 5, the same day millions of American voters will choose their
next president. Because Palau is one of the few countries in the world
that has official diplomatic relations with Taiwan as well as close ties
with the United States, Beijing will be watching the election
closely.</p>
<p>“Palau recognizes Taiwan, and it has a strong defense and security
relationship with the U.S., so undermining Palau is an extremely high
priority for China,” said Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow for
the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, in a
phone interview with VOA.</p>
<p>Deepening US ties</p>
<p>Palau is one of three Pacific Island nations that receive significant
economic support from the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association,
or COFA. Under the agreement, the U.S. provides economic aid worth
billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated
States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their
land, water and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to
their ports and territorial waters.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of President Surangel Whipps Jr., Palau’s ties
with Washington have deepened.</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. lawmakers passed funding for key provisions in COFA
for Palau. The U.S. military is also helping to repair a runway on a
World War II-era Japanese airfield on the island of Peleliu and
installing two radar systems on Palau.</p>
<p>In 2023, Whipps Jr. asked the U.S. to permanently deploy Patriot
missile defense batteries to Palau in response to China’s aggressive
posture in the Pacific. The proposal was rejected, though, in a
resolution passed by Palau’s Senate last November.</p>
<p>Despite the Palauan senate’s rejection of the U.S. missile battery
deployment, the country’s House of Delegates approved another joint
resolution that supported the idea of establishing a U.S. military base
in Palau.</p>
<p>The idea of inviting the U.S. to establish a military base in Palau
was first proposed in 2020 by Palau’s former president and Whipp Jr’s
brother-in-law, Tommy Remengesau Jr., who is running against Whipps
Jr. in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>“Since Palau is small, having the protection of the United States is
important because we see what’s happening now in the South China Sea
between the Philippines and China,” Whipps Jr., who is running for
reelection in November, told VOA at his office in Koror.</p>
<p>“We have reefs and islands that are far away from us, and it could
also be easily taken over, just like how the Chinese have invaded what
are clearly Philippine reefs,” he said.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2021, Whipps Jr. has been critical of
China’s aggressive military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, along
with what he describes as Beijing’s attempt to “weaponize” tourism
against Palau.</p>
<p>“In 2015 and 2016, tourism numbers from China went through the roof,
which helped Palau’s economy grow 30%, but since Palau never switched
diplomatic recognition [from Taiwan] to China, that number just
basically collapsed in the following years,” Whipps Jr. said.</p>
<p>In response, China’s state-run media People’s Daily said in August
that the Palauan president’s comments were an attempt to twist the
intention behind a travel advisory that China issued in June and an
effort to “smear and discredit China.”</p>
<p>Beijing’s crosshairs</p>
<p>In addition to economic pressure, some Palauan officials said the
country’s national security is threatened by repeated incursions into
its territorial waters by Chinese research vessels; cyberattacks linked
to China; the establishment of illegal Chinese scam operations in Palau;
and attempts to bribe politicians.</p>
<p>“The cyberattack happened just a day before Palau and the U.S.
exchanged diplomatic notes on COFA, so it shows that the adversaries are
watching and observing situations in Palau closely,” Jennifer Anson,
Palau’s national security coordinator, told VOA at a cafe in downtown
Koror.</p>
<p>As China continues to exert pressure on Palau, Whipps Jr. said it’s
important for Palau to uphold its “special relationship” with the
U.S.</p>
<p>“The U.S. military leaders have told me that when it comes to
security and defense, Palau is considered part of the homeland, and
given China’s expansionist program that’s destabilizing the Indo-Pacific
region, [the increased U.S. military presence in Palau] is about
deterrence and ensuring that we all continue to live in peace,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>Despite Whipps Jr.’s emphasis on bolstering security ties with the
U.S., some Palauan people, including his opponent, Remengesau Jr., say
the government needs to be more transparent about the purpose and
potential impact of U.S. military expansion in the country.</p>
<p>“The [current] government has fallen short of informing Palauan
people about the intended militarization for defense purposes,”
Remengesau Jr. told VOA at his home in Palau.</p>
<p>“Our relationship with the U.S. is supported, and we understand and
abide by our partnership responsibilities, but we also need to be very
clear about our concerns about U.S. militarization in Palau, including
how this development will affect Palau’s environment and social fabric,
as well as what is this militarization defending us from since we don’t
have any enemies,” he added.</p>
<p>Some political observers have echoed Remengesau Jr.’s concern, saying
the increased U.S. military presence will “put a target” on Palau and
potentially invite further Chinese aggression against the Pacific Island
nation.</p>
<p>“Many Palauans think President Whipps Jr.’s slogan that ‘presence is
deterrence’ doesn’t make sense because now is not wartime, and they
worry about what China might do if the U.S. continues to expand its
military presence in Palau,” Kambes Kesolei, editor of one of Palau’s
main newspapers Tia Belau, told VOA.</p>
<p>US protection</p>
<p>While some Palauans are concerned about the increased U.S. military
presence, others say it’s important for Palau to have U.S. military
protection amid intensifying geopolitical competition between Beijing
and Washington in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>“Taiwan is a target, and Palau is a target, so I’m appreciative of
the U.S. presence here because we are protected by them,” Lucius Malsol,
a Palauan tour operator, told VOA at a park in downtown Koror.</p>
<p>Despite the division over the U.S. military presence among Palauan
people, some political observers say the outcome of November’s election
won’t significantly change Palau’s foreign policy direction.</p>
<p>“A lot of Palauans are in the U.S. military and any politician in a
position to make a decision takes all of that into consideration, so I
don’t see how Palau could change our foreign policy direction
drastically,” said Leilani Reklai, publisher and editor of Palau’s main
newspaper Island Times.</p>
<p>However, Reklai and Kesolei agree that Whipps Jr. will continue to
deepen Palau’s engagement with the U.S. if he is reelected, while
Remengasau Jr. would likely take a more “neutral approach” to relations
with Washington.</p>

missile deployment to Philippines ‘incredibly important’ for combat
readiness, US general says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, Philippines — The U.S. Army’s recent deployment of a midrange
missile system to the northern Philippines was “incredibly important”
and allowed American and Filipino forces to jointly train for the
potential usage of such heavy weaponry in Asian archipelago conditions,
a U.S. general said Monday. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has moved to strengthen an arc of military
alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any
possible confrontation over Taiwan and other Asian flashpoints. The
Philippines has also worked on shoring up its territorial defenses after
its disputes with China started to escalate last year in the
increasingly volatile South China Sea. </p>
<p>China has vehemently opposed the increased deployment of American
combat forces to Asia. But it has been particularly alarmed by the U.S.
Army’s deployment in April of the Typhon missile system, a land-based
weapon that can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack
Missile, to the northern Philippines as part of joint combat exercises
in April with Philippine troops. </p>
<p>“What it does collectively, it provides us the opportunity to
understand how to employ that capability — the environmental challenges
here are very unique to any other place in the region,” U.S. Maj.
Gen. Marcus Evans, Commanding General of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry
Division, said when asked how the missile system has helped participants
in joint combat training in the Philippines. </p>
<p>“Last year, we also deployed long-range fires capabilities with
HIMARS and we were able to move those around with fixed-wing aircraft
around the archipelago environment,” Evans told The Associated Press in
an interview in Manila, referring to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket
Systems, the truck-mounted launchers, which fire GPS-guided missiles
capable of hitting distant targets. </p>
<p>“Those are just incredibly important operations because you get to
work in the environment, but most importantly, you’re working alongside
our partners here in the Philippines to understand how those will be
integrated into their operations,” Evans said without elaborating. </p>
<p>The Typhon missile system was supposed to be flown out of the
Philippines last month, but three Philippine security officials told the
AP recently that the longtime treaty allies had agreed to keep the
missile system in the northern Philippines indefinitely to boost
deterrence despite China’s expressions of alarm. </p>
<p>The Philippine officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they
were not authorized to discuss the sensitive U.S. missile deployment
publicly. </p>
<p>Evans flew to Manila to start talks with Philippine army counterparts
on holding annual military exercises by the allied forces in the
Southeast Asian country next year, particularly the Salaknib drills,
which aim to boost the combat-readiness of thousands of American and
Filipino troops in increasingly realistic settings. </p>
<p>“Conceptually, it is scheduled to be a larger, more complex
exercise,” Evans said, adding that there could be joint training
maneuvers from the jungles in the northern Philippines to former U.S.
military bases in the region. </p>
<p>“We’re also planning on bringing new equipment to train alongside our
Filipino army teammates that last year we did not have,” he said without
providing details. </p>
<p>“Our job is to get 1% better each day alongside our Filipino army
teammates in terms of readiness,” he said. “Those relationships that are
built, the readiness that is developed, should remove any doubt about
the importance of our alliances and the work we do here with the
Philippine army.” </p>
<p>Evans and other U.S. Army officials attended a ceremony Sunday
marking the anniversary of a historic moment in U.S.-Philippine
relations when U.S. Gen. Douglas Macarthur fulfilled his promise to
return to the Philippines in October 1944 by wading ashore into the
coast of central Leyte province to help lead the liberation of the
country from Japanese occupation forces. </p>
<p>On Monday, Evans and his men laid a wreath in an austere ceremony at
the American Cemetery in metropolitan Manila, the largest such U.S.
World War II cemetery and memorial in the world. </p>
<p>The Leyte Gulf ceremony reflected the long history that had bonded
American and Filipino forces in war and peace, he said. </p>
<p>“That trust was built over eight decades,” Evans said.</p>

id="garbage-in-garbage-out-ai-fails-to-debunk-disinformation-study-finds">‘Garbage
in, garbage out’: AI fails to debunk disinformation, study finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When it comes to combating disinformation ahead of the
U.S. presidential elections, artificial intelligence and chatbots are
failing, a media research group has found.</p>
<p>The latest audit by the research group NewsGuard found that
generative AI tools struggle to effectively respond to false
narratives.</p>
<p>In its latest audit of 10 leading chatbots, compiled in September,
NewsGuard found that AI will repeat misinformation 18% of the time and
offer a nonresponse 38.33% of the time — leading to a “fail rate” of
almost 40%, according to NewsGuard.</p>
<p>“These chatbots clearly struggle when it comes to handling prompt
inquiries related to news and information,” said McKenzie Sadeghi, the
audit’s author. “There’s a lot of sources out there, and the chatbots
might not be able to discern between which ones are reliable versus
which ones aren’t.”</p>
<p>NewsGuard has a database of false news narratives that circulate,
encompassing global wars and U.S. politics, Sadeghi told VOA.</p>
<p>Every month, researchers feed trending false narratives into leading
chatbots in three different forms: innocent user prompts, leading
questions and “bad actor” prompts. From there, the researchers measure
if AI repeats, fails to respond or debunks the claims.</p>
<p>AI repeats false narratives mostly in response to bad actor prompts,
which mirror the tactics used by foreign influence campaigns to spread
disinformation. Around 70% of the instances where AI repeated falsehoods
were in response to bad actor prompts, as opposed to leading prompts or
innocent user prompts.</p>
<p>Foreign influence campaigns are able to take advantage of such flaws,
according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Russia, Iran and China have used generative AI to “boost their
respective U.S. election influence efforts,” according to an
intelligence report released last month.</p>
<p>As an example of how easily AI chatbots can be misled, Sadeghi cited
a NewsGuard study in June that found AI would repeat Russian
disinformation if it “masqueraded” as coming from an American local news
source.</p>
<p>From myths about migrants to falsehoods about FEMA, the spread of
disinformation and misinformation has been a consistent theme throughout
the 2024 election cycle.</p>
<p>“Misinformation isn’t new, but generative AI is definitely amplifying
these patterns and behaviors,” Sejin Paik, an AI researcher at
Georgetown University, told VOA.</p>
<p>Because the technology behind AI is constantly changing and evolving,
it is often unable to detect erroneous information, Paik said. This
leads to not only issues with the factuality of AI’s output, but also
the consistency.</p>
<p>NewsGuard also found that two-thirds of “high quality” news sites
block generative AI models from using their media coverage. As a result,
AI often has to learn from lower-quality, misinformation-prone news
sources, according to the watchdog.</p>
<p>This can be dangerous, experts say. Much of the non-paywalled media
that AI trains on is either “propaganda” or “deliberate strategic
communication,” media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA.</p>
<p>“AI doesn’t know anything: It doesn’t sift through knowledge, and it
can’t evaluate claims,” Jordan, a media professor at Penn State, told
VOA. “It just repeats based on huge numbers.”</p>
<p>AI has a tendency to repeat “bogus” news because statistically, it
tends to be trained on skewed and biased information, he added. He
called this a “garbage in, garbage out model.”</p>
<p>NewsGuard aims to set the standard for measuring accuracy and
trustworthiness in the AI industry through monthly surveys, Sadeghi
said.</p>
<p>The sector is growing fast, even as issues around disinformation are
flagged. The generative AI industry has experienced monumental growth in
the past few years. OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently reports 200 million
weekly users, more than double from last year, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>The growth in popularity of these tools leads to another problem in
their output, according to Anjana Susarla, a professor in Responsible AI
at Michigan State University. Since there is such a high quantity of
information going in — from users and external sources — it is hard to
detect and stop the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>Many users are still willing to believe the outputs of these chatbots
are true, Susarla said.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, people can trust AI more than they trust human beings,”
she told VOA.</p>
<p>The solution to this may be bipartisan regulation, she added. She
hopes that the government will encourage social media platforms to
regulate malicious misinformation.</p>
<p>Jordan, on the other hand, believes the solution is with media
audiences.</p>
<p>“The antidote to misinformation is to trust in reporters and news
outlets instead of AI,” he told VOA. “People sometimes think that it’s
easier to trust a machine than it is to trust a person. But in this
case, it’s just a machine spewing out what untrustworthy people have
said.”</p>

Smoke Deaths Are Spiking as the Planet Warms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
If you are one of the more than 2 billion people on Earth who have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/climate/wildfire-smoke-air-pollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inhaled
wildfire smoke</u></a>, then you know firsthand that it is nasty stuff.
It makes your eyes sting and your throat sore and raw; breathe in smoke
for long enough, and you might get a headache or start to wheeze. Maybe
you’ll have an asthma attack and end up in the emergency room. Or maybe,
in the days or weeks afterward, you’ll suffer from a stroke or heart
attack that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill" target="_self"><u>you
wouldn’t have had otherwise</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Researchers are increasingly convinced that the tiny, inhalable
particulate matter in wildfire smoke, known as PM2.5, contributes to
<a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/long-term-exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-associated-with-higher-risk-of-death/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thousands
of excess deaths</u></a> annually in the United States alone. But is it
fair to link those deaths directly to climate change?
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02149-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
study</u></a> published Monday in <em><em>Nature Climate
Change</em></em> suggests that for a growing number of cases, the answer
should be yes. Chae Yeon Park, a climate risk modeling researcher at
Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, looked with her
colleagues at three fire-vegetation models to understand how hazardous
emissions changed from 1960 to 2019, compared to a hypothetical control
model that excluded historical climate change data. They found that
while fewer than 669 deaths in the 1960s could be attributed to climate
change globally, that number ballooned to 12,566 in the 2010s — roughly
a 20-fold increase. The proportion of <em><em>all</em></em> global PM2.5
deaths attributable to climate change jumped 10-fold over the same
period, from 1.2% in the 1960s to 12.8% in the 2010s.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a timely and meaningful study that informs the public and the
government about the dangers of wildfire smoke and how climate change is
contributing to that,” Yiqun Ma, who researches the intersection of
climate change, air pollution, and human health at the Yale School of
Medicine, and who was not involved in the <em><em>Nature</em></em>
study, told me.
</p>
<p>
The study found the highest climate change-attributable fire mortality
values in South America, Australia, and Europe, where increases in heat
and decreases in humidity were also the greatest. In the southern
hemisphere of South America, for example, the authors wrote that fire
mortalities attributable to climate change increased from a model
average of 35% to 71% between the 1960s and 2010s, “coinciding with
decreased relative humidity,” which dries out fire fuels. For the same
reason, an increase in relative humidity lowered fire mortality in other
regions, such as South Asia. North America exhibited a less dramatic
leap in climate-related smoke mortalities, with climate change’s
contribution around 3.6% in the 1960s, “with a notable rise in the
2010s” to 18.8%, Park told me in an email.
</p>
<p>
While that’s alarming all on its own, Ma told me there was a possibility
that Park’s findings might actually be <em><em>too</em></em>
conservative. “They assume PM2.5 from wildfire sources and from other
sources” — like from cars or power plants — “have the same toxicity,”
she explained. “But in fact, in recent studies, people have found PM2.5
from fire sources can be more toxic than those from an urban
background.” Another reason Ma suspected the study’s numbers might be an
underestimate was because the researchers focused on only six diseases
that have known links to PM2.5 exposure: chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke,
and lower respiratory infection. “According to
<a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/long-term-exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-associated-with-higher-risk-of-death/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>our
previous findings</u></a> [at the Yale School of Medicine], other
diseases can also be influenced by wildfire smoke, such as mental
disorders, depression, and anxiety, and they did not consider that
part,” she told me.
</p>
<p>
Minghao Qiu, an assistant professor at Stony Brook University and
<a href="https://mhqiu.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the country’s leading researchers</u></a> on wildfire smoke exposure
and climate change, generally agreed with Park’s findings, but cautioned
that there is “a lot of uncertainty in the underlying numbers” in part
because, intrinsically, wildfire smoke exposure is such a complicated
thing to try to put firm numbers to. “It’s so difficult to model how
climate influences wildfire because wildfire is such an idiosyncratic
process and it’s so random,” he told me, adding, “In general, models are
not great in terms of capturing wildfire.”
</p>
<p>
Despite their few reservations, both Qiu and Ma emphasized the
importance of studies like Park’s. “There are no really good solutions”
to reduce wildfire PM2.5 exposure. You can’t just “put a filter on a
stack” as you (sort of) can with power plant emissions, Qiu pointed out.
</p>
<p>
Even prescribed fires, often touted as an important wildfire mitigation
technique, still produce smoke. Park’s team acknowledged that a whole
suite of options would be needed to minimize future wildfire deaths,
ranging from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/this-is-wildfire" target="_self"><u>fire-resilient
forest and urban planning</u></a> to PM2.5 treatment advances in
hospitals. And, of course, there is addressing the root cause of the
increased mortality to begin with: our warming climate.
</p>
<p>
“To respond to these long-term changes,” Park told me, “it is crucial to
gradually modify our system.”

id="french-government-takes-new-blows-over-deal-to-sell-painkiller-maker-to-us-fund">French
government takes new blows over deal to sell painkiller maker to US
fund</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — French drugmaker Sanofi’s confirmation that it will sell a
controlling stake in its consumer health unit to a U.S. investment fund
sparked a new political backlash Monday, stoked by fears the deal marks
a loss of sovereignty over key medications.  </p>
<p>Paris “must block the sale” using powers to protect strategic
sectors, Manuel Bompard, a senior lawmaker in the hard-left France
Unbowed (LFI) party, told the TF1 broadcaster.  </p>
<p>Politicians and unions have torn into Sanofi’s proposed
16-billion-euro ($17.4 billion) deal with U.S. investment fund CD&amp;R
for a controlling stake in Opella.  </p>
<p>The subsidiary makes household-name drugs including Doliprane branded
paracetamol  whose yellow boxes dominate the French market.  </p>
<p>Under pressure, Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s minority government
said it had secured a two-percent stake in Opella for public investment
bank Bpifrance and “extremely strong” guarantees against job cuts and
offshoring.  </p>
<p>Opella employs over 11,000 workers and operates in 100 countries.
 </p>
<p>Sanofi said it is the third-largest business worldwide in the market
for over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and supplements.  </p>
<p>CD&amp;R — which has a battery of investments in France — would help
build Opella into a “French-headquartered, global consumer healthcare
champion,” the pharma giant said in a statement.  </p>
<p>‘Just words’</p>
<p>But with memories of drug shortages during and since the Covid-19
pandemic still raw for many, critics say the defenses are too weak.</p>
<p>A small stake “won’t give the French state a say in strategic
decisions” at Opella, said Bompard, whose LFI dominates a left alliance
that is the largest opposition group against Barnier and President
Emmanuel Macron.  </p>
<p>Thomas Portes, also of the LFI, posted on X that the government had
offered “no guarantees, just words.”  </p>
<p>Economy Minister Antoine Armand said a contract between CD&amp;R,
Sanofi and the government included maintaining production sites,
research and development and Opella’s official headquarters in France,
as well as investing at least 70 million euros over five years.  </p>
<p>It covers “keeping up a minimum production volume for Opella’s
sensitive products in France,” Armand added, including Doliprane,
digestive medication Lanzor and Aspegic branded aspirin.  </p>
<p>There would be financial penalties for closing French production
sites, laying off workers or failing to buy from French suppliers.  </p>
<p>That includes Seqens, a company re-establishing production in France
of Doliprane’s active ingredient paracetamol.  </p>
<p>“Workers are not at all reassured by the latest developments,” said
Johann Nicolas, a CGT union representative at Opella’s Doliprane plant
in Lisieux, northern France.  </p>
<p>He added that a picket had throttled production there from around 1.3
million boxes of the drug per day to around 265,000.  </p>
<p>The proposed protections in the deal have also failed to win over
even some in the government camp.  </p>
<p>Monday’s guarantees “do not at all indicate a commitment for the long
term, whether on investment, supply or jobs,” Charles Rodwell, a
lawmaker in Macron’s EPR party who has closely followed the case, told
AFP.  </p>
<p>He vowed “painstaking” parliamentary surveillance of government
action over the deal including measures to “block” the sale if ministers
fall short.</p>
<p>Brand loyalty</p>
<p>Macron said last week that “the government has the instruments needed
to protect France” from any unwanted “capital ownership.”  </p>
<p>Emotion over the Opella sales is closely linked to Doliprane.  </p>
<p>Boxes of the non-opioid analgesic against mild to moderate pain and
fever often line entire pharmacy walls.  </p>
<p>The drug comes in many doses — from 100 mg for babies to 1,000 mg for
adults — and in tablet, capsule, suppository and liquid forms.  </p>
<p>It is so ubiquitous that French people call any paracetamol product
Doliprane, even when made by a different manufacturer.  </p>
<p>Sanofi, among the world’s top 12 health care companies, says the
planned spinoff is part of a strategy to focus less on over-the-counter
medication and more on innovative medicines and vaccines, including for
polio, influenza and meningitis.</p>

id="should-minimum-wage-be-lower-for-workers-who-get-tipped-two-states-are-set-to-decide">Should
minimum wage be lower for workers who get tipped? Two states are set to
decide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mel Nichols, a 37-year-old bartender in Phoenix, Arizona, takes home
anywhere from $30 to $50 an hour with tips included. But the uncertainty
of how much she’s going to make on a daily basis is a constant source of
stress.</p>
<p>“For every good day, there’s three bad days,” said Nichols, who has
been in the service industry since she was a teenager. “You have no
security when it comes to knowing how much you’re going to make.”</p>
<p>That uncertainty exists largely because federal labor law allows
businesses to pay tipped workers, like food servers, bartenders and
bellhops, less than the minimum wage as long as customer tips make up
the difference. Voters in Arizona and Massachusetts will decide in
November whether it’s good policy to continue to let employers pass some
of their labor costs to consumers.</p>
<p>The ballot measures reflect an accelerating debate over the so-called
subminimum wage, which advocates say is essential to the sustainability
of the service industry and detractors say pushes the cost of labor off
employers’ shoulders and leads to the exploitation of workers.</p>
<p>The amount tipped workers make varies by state. Fourteen states pay
the federal minimum, or just above $2 an hour for tipped workers and $7
an hour for non-tipped workers.</p>
<p>Arizona employers can pay their tipped workers $3 less hourly than
other workers. Under current rates, that means tipped workers’ base pay
is $11.35 an hour.</p>
<p>Voters will decide whether to approve a measure backed by state
Republicans and the Arizona Restaurant Association to change the minimum
for tipped workers to 25% less than the regular minimum wage as long as
their pay with tips is $2 above that minimum.</p>
<p>The hourly minimum wage in Arizona is currently $14.35 and increases
yearly according to inflation.</p>
<p>Voters in Massachusetts are being asked to eliminate the tiered
minimum-wage system.</p>
<p>There, voters will decide on a measure to incrementally increase the
state’s tipped worker wage — currently $6.75 per hour — until it meets
the regular minimum wage by January 2029. The measure was put forward by
One Fair Wage, a not-for-profit that works to end the subminimum
wage.</p>
<p>If voters approve the measure, the Bay State would join seven states
that currently have a single minimum wage. Michigan will soon join that
group after an August state Supreme Court ruling initiated a phase-out
of the subminimum wage.</p>
<p>“When you’re not making the money that you should be making to pay
your bills, it becomes hard on you,” said James Ford, a longtime
Detroit-based hospitality worker. ”[The ruling] makes me think we’re
moving forward.”</p>
<p>Other states have wage measures on the ballot. In California, voters
will choose whether to raise the hourly minimum wage from $16 to $18 by
2026 in what would be the highest statewide minimum wage in the country.
Measures in Alaska and Missouri would gradually raise minimum wages to
$15 an hour while also requiring paid sick leave.</p>
<p>In the last two years, Washington, D.C., and Chicago also have
started to eliminate the subminimum wage.</p>
<p>Employers must ensure that workers get the full minimum if they don’t
make that much with tips. But they don’t always comply with federal
labor law. One in 10 restaurants and bars investigated nationally by the
U.S. Labor Department between 2010 and 2019 violated a provision of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, resulting in the establishments paying $113.9
million in back wages.</p>
<p>The issue disproportionately affects women, who make up about 47% of
the U.S. workforce but nearly 70% of those who work in tipped
professions, according to an AP analysis of U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>In Arizona, Republican state Sen. J.D. Mesnard, the sponsor of
Proposition 138, said the measure is a win for both businesses and
lower-wage workers.</p>
<p>“The employer is protected in the sense that they can preserve this
lower base, knowing that there are going to be tips on top of it,”
Mesnard said. “The tipped worker is guaranteed to make more than minimum
wage, which is more than they’re guaranteed today.”</p>
<p>Nichols doesn’t support it.</p>
<p>“It would reduce my hourly, and anything that reduces my hourly is
not something that I want to lean into,” she said. “I don’t believe that
business owners need any more cuts in labor costs.”</p>
<p>Proposition 138 was initially put forward as a response to a ballot
measure pushed by One Fair Wage that would create a single minimum wage
of $18, but the group abandoned the effort after threats of litigation
from the restaurant association over how it collected signatures.</p>
<p>Instead, One Fair Wage will focus on trying to pass a wage hike in
the Legislature. Democratic State Rep. Mariana Sandoval said she hopes
her party in November can flip the Legislature, where Republicans hold a
one-seat majority in both chambers.</p>
<p>After working for tips for more than 20 years, server Lindsay Ruck,
who works at a restaurant at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport,
said she’s faced her fair share of belligerent customers. But because
their tips make up such a significant part of her pay — approximately
$60 an hour — she’s hesitant to stand up to them.</p>
<p>To Ruck, higher base pay — not less — is called for.</p>
<p>“I think that there should be just a single minimum wage and then
people should get tipped on top of that,” Ruck said.</p>
<p>The National Restaurant Association and its state affiliates warn of
reduced hours, lower employment and menu price hikes if employers can’t
rely on tips to pay their workers. That’s why Dan Piacquadio, a co-owner
of Harold’s Cave Creek Corral restaurant outside Phoenix, is hoping
voters pass Proposition 138.</p>
<p>“This is just a way to protect our current system that’s been there
for 20 years and protect restaurant owners, keep restaurants affordable,
and most importantly, keep very good pay for all tipped workers,”
Piacquadio said.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2019, the number of restaurants and people employed
at those restaurants grew at a faster clip in the seven states that have
a single minimum wage compared to states that pay the federal minimum
tipped wage, according to labor economist Sylvia Allegretto.</p>
<p>“We are sitting here in a state that has a $16 minimum wage,”
Allegretto said from Oakland, California, where she works at the
left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. “No subminimum
wage, and we’ve got a thriving restaurant industry.”</p>

biodiversity summit</a> starts today in Cali, Colombia. Diplomats from
190 countries will try to come up with a plan to halt global
biodiversity loss, aiming to protect 30% of land and sea areas and
restore 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030. Discussions will revolve
around how to monitor nature degradation, hold countries accountable for
their protection pledges, and pay for biodiversity efforts. There will
also be a big push to get many more countries to publish national
biodiversity strategies. “This COP is a test of how serious countries
are about upholding their international commitments to stop the rapid
loss of biodiversity,”

A prominent group of oil and gas producers has developed a plan to roll
back environmental rules put in place by President Biden, <em>The

The paper got its hands on confidential documents from the American
Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), which represents some 30
producers. The documents include draft executive orders promoting fossil
fuel production for a newly-elected President Trump to sign if he takes
the White House in November, as well as a roadmap for dismantling many
policies aimed at getting oil and gas producers to disclose and curb
emissions. AXPC’s members, including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and
Hess, account for about half of the oil and gas produced in the U.S.,

from the energy think tank Ember looks at how the uptake of electric
vehicles and heat pumps in the U.K. is affecting oil and gas
consumption. It found that last year the country had 1.5 million EVs on
the road, and 430,000 residential heat pumps in homes, and the reduction
in fossil fuel use due to the growth of these technologies was
equivalent to 14 million barrels of oil, or about what the U.K. imports
over a two-week span. This reduction effect will be even stronger as
more and more EVs and heat pumps are powered by clean energy. The report
also found that even though power demand is expected to rise, efficiency
gains from electrification and decarbonization will make up for this,
leading to an overall decline in energy use and fossil fuel consumption.

to allow autonomous AI agent development starting next month</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Microsoft will allow customers to build autonomous artificial
intelligence agents starting in November, the software giant said on
Monday, in its latest move to tap the booming technology.</p>
<p>The company is positioning autonomous agents — programs which require
little human intervention unlike chatbots — as “apps for an AI-driven
world,” capable of handling client inquiries, identifying sales leads
and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Other big technology firms such as Salesforce have also touted the
potential of such agents, tools that some analysts say could provide
companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars they
are pouring into AI.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its customers can use Copilot Studio - an application
that requires little knowledge of computer code - to create autonomous
agents in public preview from November. It is using several AI models
developed in-house and by OpenAI for the agents.</p>
<p>The company is also introducing ten ready-for-use agents that can
help with routine tasks ranging from managing supply chain to expense
tracking and client communications.</p>
<p>In one demo, McKinsey &amp; Co, which had early access to the tools,
created an agent that can manage client inquires by checking interaction
history, identifying the consultant for the task and scheduling a
follow-up meeting.</p>
<p>“The idea is that Copilot [the company’s chatbot] is the user
interface for AI,” Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business
and industry Copilot at Microsoft, told Reuters.</p>
<p>“Every employee will have a Copilot, their personalized AI agent, and
then they will use that Copilot to interface and interact with the sea
of AI agents that will be out there.”</p>
<p>Tech giants are facing investor pressure to show returns on their
significant AI investments. Microsoft’s shares fell 2.8% in the
September quarter, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, but remain more than
10% higher for the year.</p>
<p>Some concerns have risen in recent months about the pace of Copilot
adoption, with research firm Gartner saying in August its survey of 152
IT organizations showed that the vast majority had not progressed their
Copilot initiatives past the pilot stage.</p>

<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit Monday
to Ukraine in a show of support for Ukraine’s military and to meet with
Ukrainian leaders.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said in a statement that Austin will also “deliver a
speech that will highlight how Ukraine has skillfully fought back
against Putin’s war of choice, U.S. commitment to ensuring Ukraine’s
armed forces have the battlefield capabilities they need, and why
Ukraine’s fight matters for U.S. security.”</p>
<p>Austin’s visit comes days after the United States announced $425
million in new aid for Ukraine, including munitions for air defense
systems and artillery munitions.</p>
<p>Russian drone attacks injured at least one person in Ukraine’s
capital, officials in Kyiv said Monday.</p>
<p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram falling debris from
drones shot down by Ukrainian air defenses damaged several residential
buildings.</p>
<p>Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on
Telegram that as many as a dozen Russian drones were involved in the
attack, but that all of them were destroyed.</p>
<p>Russian drones also targeted Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Governor
Vitalii Kim said Monday on Telegram that air defenses downed three
drones overnight.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Monday it destroyed 18 Ukrainian
drones launched in overnight attacks.</p>
<p>Eleven of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, while
another four were destroyed over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over

id="thelma-mothershed-wair-member-of-little-rock-nine-who-integrated-arkansas-school-has-died">Thelma
Mothershed Wair, member of Little Rock Nine who integrated Arkansas
school, has died</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Thelma Mothershed Wair, one of the nine Black students who integrated
a high school in Arkansas’ capital city of Little Rock in 1957 while a
mob of white segregationists yelled threats and insults, has died at age
83.</p>
<p>Mothershed Wair died Saturday at a hospital in Little Rock after
having complications from multiple sclerosis, her sister, Grace Davis,
confirmed Sunday to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The students who integrated Central High School were known as the
Little Rock Nine.</p>
<p>For three weeks in September 1957, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus used
the National Guard to block the Black students from enrolling in Central
High, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregated
classrooms were unconstitutional. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent
members of the Army’s 101st Airborne Division to escort the students
into school on Sept. 25, 1957.</p>
<p>Davis said she was enrolled at the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville when her sister and the other students — Minnijean Brown,
Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence
Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls — integrated Central High
School.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think anybody was really going to hurt her because, you
know, we’ve had racial incidents in Little Rock over the years,” Davis
said of her sister. “People would say things that were mean, but they
never really hurt anybody.”</p>
<p>Davis said in the years that followed she and her sister spoke about
the experience.</p>
<p>“I think one time somebody put some ink on her skirt or something
when she was coming through the hallway. And, of course, there was
always name-calling,” Davis said. “But she never really had any physical
confrontations with any of the students up there.”</p>
<p>Faubus closed all of the schools in Little Rock in 1958 to try to
avoid further integration. Mothershed went out of state to finish her
remaining high school classes. The academic credits transferred back to
Little Rock, and she ultimately earned her diploma from Central High
School.</p>
<p>“She was always a fighter,” Davis said of her sister. “She’s been
sick her entire life. She was born with a congenital heart defect and
was told at an early age that she would never get out of her teens. So
as she approached her 16th birthday, I remember Mother talking about how
afraid she was because she thought she was going to die. But she did
what she wanted to do. She enjoyed life.”</p>
<p>Mothershed earned a bachelor’s degree in home economics education
from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and a master’s degree in
guidance and counseling from Southern Illinois University
Edwardsville.</p>
<p>Mothershed married Fred Wair in 1965. The couple have one son, Scott;
two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2005,
and Mothershed Wair moved back to Little Rock, Davis said.</p>
<p>According to the National Park Service, Mothershed Wair worked in the
East St. Louis, Illinois, school system for 10 years as a home economics
teacher and for 18 years as a counselor for elementary career education
before retiring in 1994. She also worked at the Juvenile Detention
Center of the St. Clair County Jail in Illinois, and was an instructor
of survival skills for women at the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>Each member of the Little Rock Nine was awarded a Congressional Gold
Medal, and they donated them to the William J. Clinton Presidential
Library and Museum in Little Rock in 2011.</p>

Canadian navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait week after China war
games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — A U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed through the
sensitive Taiwan Strait together Sunday less than a week after China
conducted a new round of war games around the island, with Beijing
denouncing the mission as “disruptive.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied
countries, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims
Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to
it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet said Monday that the destroyer USS Higgins
and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver made a “routine” transit Sunday
“through waters where high-seas freedom of navigation and overflight
apply in accordance with international law.”</p>
<p>The transit demonstrated the United States’ and Canada’s commitment
to upholding freedom of navigation for all countries, it said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“The international community’s navigational rights and freedoms in
the Taiwan Strait should not be limited. The United States rejects any
assertion of sovereignty or jurisdiction that is inconsistent with
freedoms of navigations, overflight, and other lawful uses of the sea
and air,” it said.</p>
<p>China’s Eastern Theater Command said its forces monitored and warned
the ships.</p>
<p>“The actions of the United States and Canada caused trouble and are
disruptive to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” it
added.</p>
<p>China staged war-games last Monday it said were a warning to
“separatist acts” and which drew condemnation from the Taiwanese and
U.S. governments.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims saying only
the island’s people can decide their future.</p>

US Navy aviators declared dead after fighter jet crashed in Washington
state</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mount Rainier National Park, Washington — Two crew members who were
missing following the crash of a fighter jet in mountainous terrain in
Washington during a routine training flight have been declared dead, the
U.S. Navy said Sunday.</p>
<p>The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed
east of Mount Rainier on Tuesday afternoon, according to Whidbey Island
Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S
helicopter, immediately launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find
the crew and crash site.</p>
<p>Army Special Forces soldiers trained in mountaineering, high-angle
rescue and technical communications were brought in to reach the
wreckage, which was located Wednesday by an aerial crew resting at about
1,828 meters (6,000 feet) in a remote, steep and heavily wooded area
east of Mount Rainier, officials said.</p>
<p>Locating the missing crew members “as quickly and as safely as
possible” had been their priority, Capt. David Ganci, commander,
Electronic Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet, said Thursday.</p>
<p>The aviators’ names won’t be released until a day after their next of
kin have been notified, the Navy wrote in a press release Sunday, adding
that search and rescue efforts have shifted into a long-term salvage and
recovery operation as the cause of the crash is still being
investigated.</p>
<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we share the loss of two beloved
Zappers,” said Cmdr. Timothy Warburton, commanding officer of the
aviators’ Electronic Attack Squadron, in the press release.</p>
<p>“Our priority right now is taking care of the families of our fallen
aviators. … We are grateful for the ongoing teamwork to safely recover
the deceased.” Ganci said they could not identify the missing crew until
24 hours after their families had been notified of their status.</p>
<p>The crash remains under investigation.</p>
<p>The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and
includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler
squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine
Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.</p>
<p>The “Zappers” were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower.</p>
<p>The search took place near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano
that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round.</p>
<p>The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island
in 2008. In the past 15 years, the Growler has operated around the globe
supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in
front and an electronics operator behind them.</p>
<p>“The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced
technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy’s first
line of defense in hostile environments,” the Navy said on its website.
Each aircraft costs about $67 million.</p>
<p>Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and
sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths.</p>
<p>In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air
Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in
New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>
<p>Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service
members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in
crashed off the coast of Japan.</p>

of the last Navajo Code Talkers from World War II dies at 107</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — John Kinsel Sr., one of the last remaining
Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages during World War II based
on the tribe’s native language, has died. He was 107. </p>
<p>Navajo Nation officials in Window Rock announced Kinsel’s death on
Saturday. </p>
<p>Tribal President Buu Nygren has ordered all flags on the reservation
to be flown at half-staff until Oct. 27 at sunset to honor Kinsel. </p>
<p>“Mr. Kinsel was a Marine who bravely and selflessly fought for all of
us in the most terrifying circumstances with the greatest responsibility
as a Navajo Code Talker,” Nygren said in a statement Sunday. </p>
<p>With Kinsel’s death, only two original Navajo Code Talkers are still
alive: Former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and Thomas H. Begay. </p>
<p>Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the Marines to serve as Code
Talkers during the war, transmitting messages based on their
then-unwritten native language.</p>
<p>They confounded Japanese military cryptologists during World War II
and participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from
1942 to 1945, including at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo
Jima. </p>
<p>The Code Talkers sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese
troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to
the war’s ultimate outcome. </p>
<p>Kinsel was born in Cove, Arizona, and lived in the Navajo community
of Lukachukai. </p>
<p>He enlisted in the Marines in 1942 and became an elite Code Talker,
serving with the 9th Marine Regiment and the 3rd Marine Division during
the Battle of Iwo Jima. </p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan established Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982
and the Aug. 14 holiday honors all the tribes associated with the war
effort. </p>
<p>The day is an Arizona state holiday and Navajo Nation holiday on the
vast reservation that occupies portions of northeastern Arizona,
northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.</p>

writer Anne Applebaum calls for arms for Ukraine, accepts German peace
prize</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WARSAW, Poland — The prominent American journalist and historian Anne
Applebaum urged continued support for Ukraine as she accepted a
prestigious German prize Sunday, arguing that pacifism in the face of
aggression is often nothing more than appeasement.</p>
<p>Applebaum made her appeal to an audience in Frankfurt, where she was
awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. She was joined by her
husband, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who like his wife is a
strong voice on the international stage for supporting Ukraine as it
defends itself against Russia’s brutal invasion.</p>
<p>“If there is even a small chance that military defeat could help end
this horrific cult of violence in Russia, just as military defeat once
brought an end to the cult of violence in Germany, we should take it,”
Applebaum said.</p>
<p>Many Germans have embraced an ethos of pacifism because of their
nation’s aggression under Adolf Hitler during World War II. And many
have misgivings now about supplying weapons to Kyiv, fearing Russia and
worried that it could cause the war to spread beyond Ukraine’s borders
to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>“Some even call for peace by referring solemnly to the ’lessons of
German history,” Applebaum noted, according to a transcript of her
speech published by the prize organization.</p>
<p>“As I am here today accepting a peace prize, this seems the right
moment to point out that ‘I want peace’ is not always a moral argument,”
Applebaum said. “This is also the right moment to say that the lesson of
German history is not that Germans should be pacifists.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, we have known for nearly a century that a demand
for pacifism in the face of an aggressive, advancing dictatorship can
simply represent the appeasement and acceptance of that
dictatorship.”</p>
<p>She argued that the “real lesson” from German history should be that
Germans “have a special responsibility to stand up for freedom and to
take risks in doing so.”</p>
<p>The prize, which is endowed with $27,185, was awarded in St. Paul’s
Church in Frankfurt — which is considered the birthplace of German
parliamentary democracy — at the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair.</p>
<p>The prize has been awarded since 1950. It honors individuals who have
contributed to turning the idea of peace into reality through
literature, science or art. Last year’s prize was awarded to
British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie for his perseverance despite
enduring decades of threats and violence.</p>
<p>The German news agency dpa reported that Applebaum’s strong support
for continuing to arm Ukraine triggered some criticism, citing Karin
Schmidt-Friderichs, the head of the German Publishers and Booksellers
Association, which awards the prize.</p>
<p>Nonetheless she received strong applause for her speech, dpa reported
from Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Following pacifism to its logical conclusion, Applebaum argued, would
“mean that we should acquiesce to the military conquest of Ukraine, to
the cultural destruction of Ukraine, to the construction of
concentration camps in Ukraine, to the kidnapping of children in
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Applebaum writes for The Atlantic magazine. She has written books
that focus on totalitarianism in Eastern Europe, including “The Gulag,”
and “The Iron Curtain” and “Red Famine,” about dictator Joseph Stalin’s
war on Ukraine. She recently published “Autocracy, Inc. The Dictators
Who Want to Run the World.” In 2004, she was awarded the prestigious
Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>The prize jury said Applebaum’s analyses of communist and
post-communist systems in the Soviet Union and Russia reveal “the
mechanisms by which authoritarians grab hold of power and maintain their
control.”</p>
<p>The laudation for Applebaum was delivered by the Russian historian
Irina Scherbakova, a founding member of the human rights organization
Memorial, which is now banned in Russia and was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2022.</p>

officials envision turning Fifth Avenue into grand boulevard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Manhattan’s famed luxury store row Fifth Avenue is in line
for a major makeover.</p>
<p>New York City officials unveiled a plan last week to transform a
central portion of the thoroughfare between Bryant Park and Central Park
into a more pedestrian-centered boulevard.</p>
<p>They propose doubling the size of sidewalks, reducing traffic lanes
from five to three, as well as adding seating areas and hundreds of
trees and planters, among other improvements.</p>
<p>The vision is to emulate iconic strolling and shopping boulevards
such as the Champs-Élysées in Paris.</p>
<p>“As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of one of the most famous
streets in the world, New Yorkers can look forward to a brand-new Fifth
Avenue that will return the street to its former glory as a pedestrian
boulevard,” Madelyn Wils, interim president of the Fifth Avenue
Association, which runs the local business improvement district, said in
a statement. “Reversing the century-old trend of putting cars first,
this visionary design will transform our overcrowded avenue into a
spacious and green corridor for shoppers and workers, visitors and New
Yorkers, and everyone on Fifth.”</p>
<p>The plan would cost more than $350 million and be paid through a mix
of public and private financing, according to Mayor Eric Adams’
administration and the Future of Fifth Partnership.</p>
<p>Officials said the project represents the avenue’s first major
redesign and could pay for itself in less than five years through
increased property and sales tax revenue.</p>
<p>But some transit advocates have voiced concerns, saying the plan does
not give enough consideration to the needs of the public bus system or
the city’s many cyclists.</p>
<p>A public meeting will be held later this month on the plan, and
construction could begin in 2028.</p>
<p>Officials say Fifth Avenue is roughly 100 feet wide, with just two
23-foot sidewalks, even though pedestrians make up 70% of all traffic on
the corridor.</p>
<p>Some 5,500 pedestrians traverse its blocks on average each hour, a
number that swells to 23,000 people an hour during the holidays,
officials said.</p>
<p>“People across the globe identify Fifth Avenue as a premier
destination for strolling and shopping,” Meera Joshi, the city’s deputy
mayor for operations, said in a statement. “But its larger-than-life
reputation means that its sidewalks have reached their capacity, hosting
more people per hour in peak seasons than Madison Square Garden.”</p>
<p>The Fifth Avenue plan was among other ambitious plans for roadways
city officials revealed [last] week.</p>
<p>They also proposed capping stretches of the Cross Bronx Expressway, a
major highway that cuts through the borough of the Bronx.</p>
<p>City officials said the proposals would build parks and greenspaces
atop the covered highway, helping restore urban neighborhoods hollowed
out by the expansion of the national highway system and the development
of suburbs.</p>
<p>“This is a historic opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and
reconnect communities once again,” Joshi said.</p>

Oscar makes landfall in eastern Cuba after striking Bahamas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami, florida — Hurricane Oscar has made landfall in eastern Cuba,
an island beleaguered by a massive power outage, after striking the
southeastern Bahamas earlier in the day Sunday, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>The hurricane center in Miami said the storm’s center arrived in the
Cuban province of Guantanamo, near the city of Baracoa, on Sunday
evening. Its maximum sustained winds were near 130 km/h (80 mph).</p>
<p>The system is expected to move across eastern Cuba Sunday night and
Monday. Forecasters said 15.2 to 30.5 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of
rain are expected across eastern Cuba through early Wednesday, with some
isolated locations getting up to 45.72 centimeters (18 inches). A storm
surge of up to 0.91 meters (3 feet) in some areas of Cuba’s north shore
in the area was possible, the center said.</p>
<p>Oscar was expected to weaken over eastern Cuba before making a turn
to the northeast and approaching the central Bahamas on Tuesday, the
center said.</p>
<p>The storm’s center was located about 10 kilometers (5 miles)
east-southeast of Baracoa, or about 80 kilometers (50 miles)
east-northeast of Guantanamo. It was heading west-southwest at 11 km/h
(7 mph).</p>
<p>Oscar made landfall on Great Inagua island in the Bahamas earlier
Sunday. It was expected to produce a dangerous storm surge that could
translate into significant coastal flooding there and in other areas of
the southeastern Bahamas. Five to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) of
rainfall were expected, with isolated areas seeing up to 15.2
centimeters (6 inches).</p>
<p>The hurricane’s arrival comes as Cuba tries to recover from its worst
blackout in at least two years, which left millions without power for
two days last week. Some electrical service was restored Saturday.</p>
<p>Philippe Papin of the National Hurricane Center said it was somewhat
unexpected that Oscar became a hurricane Saturday.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the system kind of snuck up a little bit on us,” Papin
said.</p>
<p>Hours earlier Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico’s southern
Caribbean coast. It degenerated into a tropical depression as it moved
over land.</p>

<h2 id="whooping-cough-is-at-a-decade-high-level-in-us">Whooping cough
is at a decade-high level in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Whooping cough is at its highest level in a decade for
this time of year, U.S. health officials reported Thursday.</p>
<p>There have been 18,506 cases of whooping cough reported so far, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That’s the most at this
point in the year since 2014, when cases topped 21,800.</p>
<p>The increase is not unexpected — whooping cough peaks every three to
five years, health experts said. And the numbers indicate a return to
levels before the coronavirus pandemic, when whooping cough and other
contagious illnesses plummeted.</p>
<p>Still, the tally has some state health officials concerned, including
those in Wisconsin, where there have been about 1,000 cases so far this
year, compared to a total of 51 last year.</p>
<p>Nationwide, CDC has reported that kindergarten vaccination rates
dipped last year and vaccine exemptions are at an all-time high.
Thursday, it released state figures, showing that about 86% of
kindergartners in Wisconsin got the whooping cough vaccine, compared to
more than 92% nationally.</p>
<p>Whooping cough, also called pertussis, usually starts out like a
cold, with a runny nose and other common symptoms, before turning into a
prolonged cough. It is treated with antibiotics. Whooping cough used to
be very common until a vaccine was introduced in the 1950s, which is now
part of routine childhood vaccinations. It is in a shot along with
tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The combo shot is recommended for
adults every 10 years.</p>
<p>“They used to call it the 100-day cough because it literally lasts
for 100 days,” said Joyce Knestrick, a family nurse practitioner in
Wheeling, West Virginia.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is usually seen mostly in infants and young children,
who can develop serious complications. That’s why the vaccine is
recommended during pregnancy, to pass along protection to the newborn,
and for those who spend a lot of time with infants.</p>
<p>But public health workers say outbreaks this year are hitting older
kids and teens. In Pennsylvania, most outbreaks have been in middle
school, high school and college settings, an official said. Nearly all
the cases in Douglas County, Nebraska, are schoolkids and teens, said
Justin Frederick, deputy director of the health department.</p>
<p>That includes his own teenage daughter.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible disease. She still wakes up — after being treated
with her antibiotics — in a panic because she’s coughing so much she
can’t breathe,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s important to get tested and treated with antibiotics early, said
Dr. Kris Bryant, who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at
Norton Children’s in Louisville, Kentucky. People exposed to the
bacteria can also take antibiotics to stop the spread.</p>
<p>“Pertussis is worth preventing,” Bryant said. “The good news is that
we have safe and effective vaccines.”</p>

<h2 id="many-schools-are-still-closed-weeks-after-hurricane-helene">Many
schools are still closed weeks after Hurricane Helene</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of students in the Southeast are dealing with
school disruptions after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc so severe — on
homes, campuses and municipal power and water systems — that some
districts have no idea when they will reopen.</p>
<p>While virtual learning helped during the COVID-19 school closures,
that has not been an option for this crisis because internet and
cellphone service has remained spotty since the storm struck in late
September.</p>
<p>In hard-hit western North Carolina, some districts warn students will
miss up to a month of school, and others say they can’t yet determine a
timeline for returning to classrooms.</p>
<p>“I feel like a month is a lot, but it’s not something that can’t be
overcome,” said Marissa Coleman, who has sent her four children to stay
with grandparents in Texas because their home in North Carolina’s
Buncombe County has no running water. “But if we get further into
Thanksgiving and Christmas, it’s like, how are they actually going to
make this up?”</p>
<p>In mountainous Buncombe County, Helene swept away homes, cut power
and destroyed crucial parts of the water system for Asheville, a city of
about 94,000 people. The storm decimated remote towns and killed at
least 246 people throughout the Appalachians, where massive cleanup
efforts have been complicated by washed-out bridges and roads. It was
the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in
2005.</p>
<p>The Buncombe County School system, which serves over 22,000 students,
told families Tuesday on the district’s Facebook page no decision has
been made “with regards to start date or length of day” because of a
need to repair buildings, restore phone and security systems and redraw
bus routes.</p>
<p>Even when schools reopen, educators worry the disruption could have
profound effects on students’ learning and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Children who experience natural disasters are more prone to acute
illness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, research shows. The
physical and mental health impacts put them at greater risk of learning
loss: Absences can undermine achievement, as can the effects of trauma
on brain function.</p>
<p>The challenges come amid growing concerns about the impacts of
climate change on students. Wildfires have swept through communities,
displacing families. Many school systems with inadequate heating or air
conditioning have closed during extreme weather or forced students and
educators to endure sweltering or frigid temperatures. According to the
World Bank, 400 million children lost school days because of
“climate-related closures” in 2022.</p>
<p>Days after Helene made landfall, Hurricane Milton roared ashore last
week farther south along the same Florida coast as a Category 3 storm.
While about half the state’s districts were closed, all of them were
planning to reopen by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Schools affected by Helene are trying to provide stability. The
Buncombe district has suggested parents trade books with neighbors and
friends for their kids. “Have them write, maybe about something they’re
looking forward to when school starts again,” the district told parents
on social media. “Turn everyday experiences into math problems.”</p>
<p>Cécile Wight, a mother of two in Asheville, said she has been
grateful for concern shown by schools including surveys checking on
families’ well-being and an elementary school bus driver who took his
own car to visit each child on his route.</p>
<p>“That has been huge, just having the emotional support from the
school system and from the people we know at the school,” she said.</p>
<p>But uncertainty remains. Wight said her family is able to stay at
their home because they have well water, but many other families have
yet to return since evacuating. Most of Buncombe’s 45 schools still
lacked running water as of Tuesday, meaning they’re unable to meet basic
safety and hygiene standards.</p>
<p>Schools have begun exploring whether it would be possible to open
without running water, relying on portable bathroom trailers. In a
letter to families, Asheville Superintendent Maggie Furman said the
district is considering drilling wells at each school so they don’t have
to rely on city water.</p>
<p>Coleman said her kids are eager for some kind of normalcy.</p>
<p>“I understand the schools are going to have to take some time to find
a way to open safely, and I support that 100%. But I definitely am not
in the camp of ‘We need to wait until we get water back, until
everything’s normal again to open.’ I just think that’s going to be too
long,” Coleman said.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Education is still trying to determine
how many schools remain closed since Hurricane Helene and how many took
too much damage to reopen.</p>
<p>Echoing the COVID-19 pandemic, several schools in Tennessee have
postponed traditions like homecoming games, parades and dances. Many
colleges are also granting extensions on application deadlines,
officials say, to reduce high school seniors’ stress.</p>
<p>In storm-drenched areas elsewhere, some early education providers may
never reopen.</p>
<p>Private child care and preschool centers are particularly vulnerable
in the aftermath of a natural disaster, said Militza Mezquita, senior
adviser for education in emergencies at Save the Children. Many already
operate on thin margins, meaning a temporary closure can easily turn
permanent. As for-profit companies, they are also ineligible for many
types of disaster aid. A natural disaster can wipe out 10% to 20% of
providers, Mezquita said.</p>
<p>“Child care recovery is very critical to the whole recovery
ecosystem,” Mezquita said, noting the people essential to recovery —
road workers, cleanup crews, doctors and nurses — often have young
children that need to be looked after. “If they are not able to
adequately get their children in care, they can’t go to work.”</p>
<p>Despite the instability, educators like Heather Smith, who was named
North Carolina’s Teacher of the Year in the spring, encourage families
to see the lessons storms can provide. Smith brought along her two
children, ages 8 and 4, to serve meals at her church.</p>
<p>“Our kids are learning so much every day, whether it’s about
adversity, whether it’s about helping a community,” said Smith, who rode
out the storm at her home in Waynesville.</p>
<p>Similarly, Wight has been taking her children to volunteer for relief
efforts at a school. She said it has helped them feel active and
involved in the community.</p>
<p>“If COVID taught us something, it’s that we can make things work. The
kids are resilient,” Wight said. “They will eventually catch up on the
academic side of things.”</p>

<p>NEW YORK — Cher, Mary J. Blige and Ozzy Osbourne were among this
year’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, an elite group formally
introduced into the music pantheon Saturday at a star-studded concert
gala.</p>
<p>Kool &amp; the Gang, Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, A Tribe Called

probes unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack
plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is investigating an unauthorized
release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack
Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S.
official said the documents appear to be legitimate.</p>
<p>The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence
Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel was still
moving military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response
to Iran’s blistering ballistic missile attack on October 1. They were
sharable within the “Five Eyes,” which are the U.S., Great Britain,
Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted to the
Telegram messaging app and first reported by CNN and Axios. The
officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
<p>The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained —
including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S.
intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack — and
whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the
officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to
determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the
official said.</p>
<p>The U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of
Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza, and has
likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military
operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war.
However, Israel’s leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let
Iran’s missile attack go unanswered.</p>
<p>Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by
the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the
documents but did not have further comment.</p>
<p>The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to
the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has
killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women
and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military
says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters.</p>
<p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for
comment over the leak of the two documents.</p>
<p>The documents first appeared online Friday via a channel on Telegram,
claiming they had been leaked by someone in the U.S. intelligence
community, then later the U.S. Defense Department. The information
appeared entirely gathered through the use of satellite image
analysis.</p>
<p>One of the two documents resembled the style of other material from
the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency leaked by Jack
Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman who pleaded guilty in March to
leaking highly classified military documents about Russia’s war on
Ukraine and other national security secrets.</p>
<p>The Telegram channel involved in the leak identifies itself as being
based in Tehran, Iran’s capital. It previously published memes featuring
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and material in support of
Tehran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance,” which includes Middle East
militant groups armed by the Islamic Republic.</p>

dead after ferry dock gangway collapses on Georgia’s Sapelo Island</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAVANNAH, Georgia — At least seven people were killed Saturday after
part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgia’s Sapelo Island, authorities
said.</p>
<p>Multiple people were taken to hospitals, and crews from the U.S.
Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to
spokesperson Tyler Jones of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources,
which operates the dock.</p>
<p>Jones said a gangway at the dock collapsed and sent people plunging
into the water. It happened as crowds gathered on the island for a
celebration of its tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave
descendants.</p>
<p>“There have been seven fatalities confirmed,” Jones said. “There have
been multiple people transported to area hospitals, and we are
continuing to search the water for individuals.”</p>
<p>Jones said he did not know what caused the gangway to collapse, but
officials believe there were at least 20 people on it at the time. The
gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another
dock onshore.</p>
<p>Among the dead was a chaplain for the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources, Jones said.</p>
<p>Sapelo Island is about 97 kilometers south of Savannah and is
reachable from the mainland by boat.</p>
<p>Cultural Day is an annual fall event spotlighting the island’s tiny
community of Hogg Hummock, which is home to a few dozen Black residents.
The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded by former
slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding.</p>
<p>Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the
South — known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia — are scattered along the
coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from
the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage,
from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing
and weaving baskets.</p>

mail carriers reach tentative contract for raises, trucks that stay
cool</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Some 200,000 mail carriers have reached a tentative contract deal
with the U.S. Postal Service that includes backdated pay raises and a
promise to provide workers with air-conditioned trucks. </p>
<p>The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified by union members,
runs through November 2026. Letter deliverers have been working without
a contract since May 2023. </p>
<p>Both the union and the Postal Service welcomed the agreement, which
was announced Friday. </p>
<p>“Both sides didn’t get everything they wanted. But by bargaining in
good faith, we ended with an agreement that meets our goals and rewards
our members,” Brian Renfroe, the president of the National Association
of Letter Carriers, told The Associated Press. “To make that happen, the
Postal Service had to recognize the contributions of members to the
Postal Service and the American people.” </p>
<p>Among other improvements, the deal increases the top pay and reduces
the amount of time it takes new workers to reach that level, Renfroe
said. He credited Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and his deputy for
bargaining in good faith throughout the arduous process. </p>
<p>The Postal Service said the agreement supported its 10-year
‘Delivering for America’ mission to modernize operations and adapt to
changing customer needs. </p>
<p>“This is a fair and responsible agreement that serves the best
interest of our employees, our customers and the future of the Postal
Service,” said Doug Tulino, the deputy postmaster general and chief
human resources officer. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, all city carriers will get three annual pay
increases of 1.3% each by 2025, some of which will be paid retroactively
from November 2023. Workers will also receive retroactive and future
cost-of-living</p>
<p>There is also a commitment from the Postal Service to “make every
effort” to provide mail trucks with air-conditioning. </p>
<p>The Postal Service in summer began rolling out its new electric
delivery vehicles, which come equipped with air-conditioning. While the
trucks won’t win any beauty contests, they did get rave reviews from
letter carriers accustomed to older vehicles that lack modern safety
features and are prone to breaking down — and even catching fire. </p>
<p>Within a few years, the new delivery fleet will have expanded to
60,000, most of them electric models, serving as the Postal Service’s
primary delivery truck from Maine to Hawaii. </p>
<p>Under the tentative contract agreement, the Postal Service must
discuss with the union any plans to buy new mail trucks that don’t have
air-conditioning. </p>
<p>This is the second contract negotiated since DeJoy was appointed
postmaster general in 2020. It is expected to take several weeks for
union members to ratify the contract. Rural mail deliverers aren’t
covered by the contract because they are represented by a different
union.</p>

id="last-us-in-person-vote-will-be-cast-in-alaskas-aleutian-islands">Last
US in-person vote will be cast in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — On a desolate slab of island tundra in western
Alaska, a resident of Adak will again become the last American to cast
an in-person ballot for president, continuing a 12-year tradition for
the nation’s westernmost community.</p>
<p>The honor of having the last voter in the nation fell to Adak when
they did away with absentee-only voting for the 2012 election and added
in-person voting.</p>
<p>“People have a little bit of fun on that day because, I mean,
realistically everybody knows the election’s decided way before we’re
closed,” said city manager Layton Lockett. “But, you know, it’s still
fun.”</p>
<p>When polls close in Adak, it will be 1 a.m. on the East Coast.</p>
<p>Adak Island, midway in the Aleutian Island chain and bordered by the
Bering Sea to the north and the North Pacific Ocean to the south, is
closer to Russia than mainland Alaska. The island best known as a former
World War II military base and later naval station is 1,931 kilometers
(1,200 miles) southwest of Anchorage and farther west than Hawaii, where
polls close an hour earlier.</p>
<p>Mary Nelson said Republican Mitt Romney was likely conceding the 2012
race to President Barack Obama on election night when she became Adak’s
first last voter in a presidential election, although she didn’t know
Obama had been reelected until the next morning when she turned on her
computer to read election results.</p>
<p>Nelson, who now lives in Washington state, recalled to The Associated
Press by telephone that she was a poll worker in Adak at the time and
had forgotten to vote until just before the 8 p.m. poll closing
time.</p>
<p>“When I opened the [voting booth’s] curtain to come back out, the
city manager took my picture and announced that I was the last person in
Adak to vote,” she said.</p>
<p>That was also the end of the celebration since they still had work to
do.</p>
<p>“We had votes to count, and they were waiting for us in Nome to call
with our vote count,” she said.</p>
<p>There are U.S. territories farther west than Alaska, but there’s no
process in the Electoral College to allow residents in Guam, the
northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Minor Outlying
Islands to vote for president, according to the National Archives.</p>
<p>“I’ve been tickled pink and told people about it,” said Nelson, now
73. “I have the story I printed out about it and show some people who I
think would think it’s a big deal, like my family,” she said.</p>
<p>Adak Island has historical significance for its role in World War II.
The U.S. built facilities on the island after Japanese forces took
islands farther west in the Aleutian chain.</p>
<p>Troops landed in August 1942, to begin building an Army base, and
enemy planes dropped nine bombs on the island two months later, but in
undeveloped areas, and riddled the landscape with machine gun fire. The
Navy began building facilities in January 1943.</p>
<p>In May 1943, about 27,000 combat troops gathered on Adak as a staging
point to retake nearby Attu Island from the Japanese.</p>
<p>Among famous Americans stationed at Adak were writers Dashiell
Hammett and Gore Vidal. The island also played host to President
Franklin Roosevelt, boxing champion Joe Lewis and several Hollywood
stars, according to the Adak Historical Society.</p>
<p>In a lighter note, the Army attempted to start a forest on Adak
Island between 1943 and 1945. A sign placed by residents in the 1960s
outside the area of 33 trees noted: “You are now Entering and Leaving
the Adak National Forest.”</p>
<p>After the war, the island was transferred to the Air Force and then
the Navy in 1950. Nearly 32,000 hectares (80,000 acres) of the
73,000-hectare (180,000-acre) island were set aside for Navy use, and
the rest of the island remained part of what eventually became the
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The base closed in 1997. The Navy retains about 2,300 hectares (5,600
acres) with the remainder either owned by the Aleut Corporation, the
Alaska Native regional corporation for the area; the city of Adak; or
the refuge.</p>
<p>Lockett said the city is facing tough times with a dwindling
population and lack of an economic driver. The town’s fish processing
plant has closed numerous times over the years.</p>
<p>When the base was active, there were about 6,000 residents on Adak
Island. The 2020 Census counted 171 residents. Lockett says that’s
probably now down to below 50 full-time residents.</p>
<p>In Alaska, a school must have 10 students to remain open. Mike
Hanley, the Aleutian Region School District superintendent, said in an
email that the school closed in 2023 after it started the year with six
students. That shrank to one by November, and then that student
left.</p>
<p>Hanley said by the time he notified the state education department,
“there were literally no children on the island, not even younger pre-K
students.”</p>
<p>When it comes to politics, Lockett said it’s pretty easy in a small
town to know where your neighbors fall politically, but there seems to
be one goal that unites everyone.</p>
<p>Whoever is in office, are they going to try to “encourage the
military to come back to Adak in some way, shape or form?” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re kind of in that great midst of, what’s next for Adak, because
we’re struggling,” he said.</p>
<p>For now, with the presidential election coming up, the city can focus
on its unique place in America.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure who the last voter will be this year,” said Adak City
Clerk Jana Lekanoff. “Maybe it’ll be a bit of a competition?”</p>
<p><br></p>

id="judges-punishing-jan.-6-rioters-fear-more-political-violence-as-election-nears">Judges
punishing Jan. 6 rioters fear more political violence as election
nears</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Over the past four years, judges at Washington’s federal
courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S.
Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation’s democracy. On the
cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear
another burst of political violence could be coming.</p>
<p>Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge
Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month’s
election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and
his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that
fueled the mob’s January 6, 2021, riot.</p>
<p>“That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,” Walton
said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential
nominee by name. “He’s riling up the troops again, so if he doesn’t get
what he wants, it’s not inconceivable that we will experience that same
situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.”</p>
<p>‘It scares me’</p>
<p>Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other
judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like
the one that injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As
Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a
message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can’t be
tolerated.</p>
<p>“It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either
side is not happy with the results of the election,” Judge Jia Cobb, a
nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last
month for four Capitol rioters.</p>
<p>Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically
motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who
helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later
told FBI agents that a “call to battle was announced” and that he had
“answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming
out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that
Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,” Contreras, a
President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to
more than five years in prison.</p>
<p>Trump’s distortion of the January 6 attack has been a cornerstone of
his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any
responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows,
assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they
met to certify Biden’s 2020 victory.</p>
<p>‘Patriots’ and ‘hostages’</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls “patriots” and
“hostages,” if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the
results of the upcoming election only if it’s “free and fair,” casting
doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020.</p>
<p>Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce
those efforts to downplay the violence on January 6 and cast the rioters
as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such
rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy.</p>
<p>“We’re in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can
survive it,” Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse
who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the
Capitol.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a young daughter, I’ve got a young grandson, and I would
like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it
has been to me,” he said. “But I don’t know if we survive with the
mentality that took place that day.”</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related
to the January 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of
presidential power for the first time in the nation’s history. Over
1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them
received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.</p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a
prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from
engaging in more politically motivated violence.</p>
<p>“With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices
in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the
potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,” prosecutors have
repeatedly warned in court filings.</p>
<p>‘I’d do it all over again’</p>
<p>Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse
for their actions on January 6 could break the law again. Some rioters
even seem to be proud of their crimes.</p>
<p>The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, “I’ll go
again given the opportunity.”</p>
<p>A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud
Boys extremist group members told a judge, “You can give me 100 years,
and I’d do it all over again.” A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told
a television interviewer that she would “do it again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the “J6
praying grandma” avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate
judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol
grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to
Washington on January 6.</p>
<p>“And she has all but promised to do it all over again,” said
prosecutor Terence Parker.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial
conviction, Lavrenz went on a “media blitz” to defend the mob, spread
misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her
celebrity in a community that believes January 6 “was a good day for
this country,” Parker said.</p>
<p>Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home
confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to “lower the
volume” before the next election.</p>
<p>“These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country
apart, they’re not going to help you,” Faruqui told her.</p>

makes new offer to union in hopes of ending strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boeing and the union representing striking machinists have negotiated
a new contract proposal that would provide bigger pay raises and bonuses
in a bid to end a costly walkout that has crippled production of
airplanes for more than a month.</p>
<p>The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
said early Saturday that it plans to hold a ratification vote
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The union said the deal would increase pay by 35% over four years, up
from 30% that was offered last month. It also boosts upfront bonuses to
$7,000 per worker instead of $6,000.</p>
<p>The new offer would not restore a traditional pension plan — a key
demand of the 33,000 striking workers — but it would increase the amount
of contributions to 401(k) retirement plans that Boeing would match, the
union said.</p>
<p>“We look forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal,”
Boeing said in a statement.</p>
<p>About 33,000 members of IAM District 751 began a strike on September
14. The strike has halted production of Boeing 737s, including the 737
Max, and 767s and 777s. Boeing is continuing to build 787 Dreamliners at
a nonunion plant in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The strike has led new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg to announce about
17,000 layoffs and take early steps toward raising up to $25 billion
from new stock or debt to bolster the company’s finances.</p>

id="southeast-asia-bears-brunt-of-us-trade-curbs-on-uyghur-forced-labor">Southeast
Asia bears brunt of US trade curbs on Uyghur forced labor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — Southeast Asia is bearing the mounting brunt of U.S. trade
curbs aimed at stemming the forced labor of ethnic minority Uyghurs in
China, with billions of dollars in blocked exports, the latest U.S.
trade figures show.</p>
<p>Economists and human rights experts ascribe the heavy hit the region
is taking to global supply chains shifting to reroute exports from China
through Southeast Asia and to China’s persistent dominance in key
commodities.</p>
<p>With both powerful forces at play, Southeast Asia is “caught in the
middle,” Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak
Institute in Singapore, told VOA.</p>
<p>The United States has detained $3.56 billion worth of imports in all
since its Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or UFLPA, took effect in
mid-2022, according to recent figures from U.S. Customs and Border
Protection. Some 86% of those, more than $3 billion worth, arrived from
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Only $395 million arrived directly from
China.</p>
<p>The act forbids imports of any products made in whole or in part in
China’s Xinjiang autonomous region, the Uyghurs’ historic homeland,
presuming they have been made with forced labor. While many of the
shipments are eventually allowed to enter the United States, the burden
is on the importer to secure their release by proving the products are
produced without forced labor, a process that can take months.</p>
<p>The United States and other governments have accused China of
genocide over its treatment of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs for subjecting
them to not only forced labor but mass surveillance and detention,
religious persecution and forced sterilization — all denied by
Beijing.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is a major source of some commodities crucial to the global
supply chain, including 12% of the world’s aluminum, more than a third
of the polysilicon for solar panels and 90% of the cotton produced by
China, according to the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur
Region, a global network of rights groups.</p>
<p>Many of those supply chains now flow through Southeast Asia for
reasons beyond just the UFLPA, said Nick Marro, principal Asia economist
and global trade lead analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>“For years, multinational companies — both Chinese and non-Chinese
owned — have been pouring investment into Southeast Asia to construct
supply chains aimed at dodging U.S. tariffs,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>While far from the only reason for the influx, he said, “shifting
some production chains to Vietnam or Thailand, for example, can
obfuscate whether a good might originally be produced in China.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t necessarily a fool-proof strategy,” Marro said. “U.S.
trade authorities are very sensitive to illegal transshipments and other
efforts aimed at circumventing U.S. duties. But for some supply chains,
cracking down on these activities can be challenging — especially for
products like cotton, which is notoriously difficult to trace.”</p>
<p>Evolving supply chains now require looking beyond exports arriving
directly from China to catch what’s made there, said Menon, a former
lead economist for trade with the Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>“Increasingly there’s production and value addition in multiple
countries,” he said. “Simply looking at goods that emanate from Xinjiang
to the U.S. will not capture the intended objective.”</p>
<p>Of the slightly more than $3 billion worth of exports the United
States has detained from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam because of the
UFLPA, the vast majority, $2.96 billion, have been electronics,
including solar panels.</p>
<p>Louisa Greve, global advocacy director for the Washington-based
Uyghur Human Rights Project, ascribes that to the surge of investment
from Chinese solar panel makers into Southeast Asia starting more than a
decade ago.</p>
<p>“We don’t know of any Uyghurs working in Southeast Asia in solar, but
we do know where the polysilicon has to come from. That’s the issue,”
she told VOA. “It’s about the components.”</p>
<p>Greve added that the Southeast Asian countries and companies involved
in importing and incorporating that polysilicon into the solar panels
they help make and export also risk being complicit in the
state-sponsored forced labor that goes into producing it in China.</p>
<p>“Thirty-five percent of the world’s polysilicon, or solar-grade
polysilicon, is coming from China. It’s up to every manufacturer, like
the plants that are actually making solar panels in Southeast Asia … to
say, ‘We have to be responsible for the raw materials that we’re
using,’” she said.</p>
<p>Menon asserted the UFLPA could benefit low-wage countries less
tainted by forced labor than China by driving more business their way,
but he said that Southeast Asia will still struggle to wean itself off
Chinese supplies.</p>
<p>“China is still the hub or the center of ASEAN [Association of
Southeast Asian Nations] supply chains. That hasn’t changed. There’s
been some reconfiguration taking place, but by and large, China’s not
going away,” he said.</p>
<p>Menon said that “blunt” trade tools like the act can also hurt the
countries in the middle of those supply chains by driving existing
production and investment away, leaving local workers with less work or
fewer jobs.</p>
<p>“This [act] is quite a big move, quite a massive measure, and so I’d
be surprised if it doesn’t have some impact in moving production
around,” he said. “If you ban imports in this way, inevitably there will
be some shifts that move production in a way that tries to circumvent
those bans.”</p>
<p>Marro said the same pressures that drove companies to “de-risk” by
moving production from China to Southeast Asia years ago could yet prove
a “double-edged sword.” While the shift has boosted Southeast Asia’s
economies, the costs may mount as the United States and others start
taking a harder look at countries helping China evade their trade
curbs.</p>
<p>Even with only 11 months of the 2024 fiscal year reported, U.S.
customs figures show the UFLPA blocked more imports from Southeast Asia
over the past year than the year before.</p>
<p>Marro said enforcement efforts were at a “very real risk” of picking
up but added that geopolitics could also intervene.</p>
<p>“As much as U.S. officials want to crack down on Chinese tariff
circumvention, there’s an equal effort to avoid isolating Southeast Asia
when it comes to the U.S.’s increasingly hawkish strategy towards
China,” he said. “This balancing act will characterize the future of
U.S. policy to the region.”</p>

digs out of mountains of sand swept in by back-to-back hurricanes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRADENTON BEACH, Florida — When a hurricane sets its sights on
Florida, storm-weary residents may think of catastrophic wind, hammering
rain and dangerous storm surge. Mounds of sand swallowing their homes?
Not so much.</p>
<p>That’s the reality for some after Hurricanes Helene and Milton
clobbered Florida’s Gulf Coast with back-to-back hits in less than two
weeks. Storm surge as high as 3 meters swept mountains of sand into
communities — in some areas, 1.5 meters high or higher.</p>
<p>The fine, white sand helps make Florida’s beaches among the best in
the world. But the powerful storms have turned the precious commodity
into a costly nuisance, with sand creating literal barriers to recovery
as homeowners and municipalities dig their way out.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen sand like this,” said Scott Bennett, a contractor
who has worked in storm recovery since 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. “Wind,
rain, water, but never sand.”</p>
<p>The morning after Hurricane Milton crashed ashore, the roads of
Bradenton Beach, about an hour’s drive south of Tampa, were lined with
sandbanks less than a meter high, surrounding some bungalows. The views
of the Old Florida beach town were not unlike those after a blustery
Midwestern blizzard.</p>
<p>“The best way to describe it, it’s like getting 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to
1.8 meters) of snow up north,” said Jeremi Roberts, a member of the
State Emergency Response Team surveying the damage that day.</p>
<p>Another hour south, Ron and Jean Dyer said the storms blew about 0.9
meters of sand up against their condo building on Venice Island.</p>
<p>“The beach just moved over everything,” Ron Dyer said.</p>
<p>It had taken dozens of volunteers armed with shovels and wheelbarrows
two days to dig all the sand out of the condo’s pool after Hurricane
Helene, only to see Milton fill it back in, he said.</p>
<p>“They just kept digging and wheeling and digging and wheeling. … They
were there for two days doing that,” he said. “We got to do it all over
again.”</p>
<p>Storm recovery contractor Larry West estimates that his team will do
about $300,000 worth of work just to clean up all the sand and debris
left behind at one of the condo buildings he’s restoring in Manasota
Key, about 56 kilometers south of Sarasota. He expects many property
owners, especially those who don’t have flood insurance, will have to
pay out of pocket for this kind of cleanup.</p>
<p>“The poor homeowner who’s going to have to spend $150,000 cleaning
up, that’s going to hurt them hard,” West said.</p>
<p>West said he is not sure where to take the sand, after he heard that
a local park that Charlotte County officials designated as a drop-off
site was filling up with the stuff. According to the county, two sites
remain open for dropping off sand.</p>
<p>“Right now I’m building mountains in their parking area,” West said
of the condo complex he’s restoring. “We’re just kind of waiting to find
out if they’re gonna have us transport it to a different location.”</p>
<p>Officials in hard-hit Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, are
still crunching the numbers on just how big of a bite Helene and Milton
took out of the coastline there, but county Public Works director Kelli
Hammer Levy puts the current estimate at 765,000 cubic meters of sand
lost.</p>
<p>“A lot of volume has been lost, and that’s our main concern here
right now,” she told the county’s Tourism Development Council. “It’s
hard to kind of stay positive with some of this stuff. I know the
pictures are not what we want to see.”</p>
<p>For perspective, a 2018 beach renourishment project to shore up the
county’s coastline with 994,000 cubic meters of sand cost more than $50
million, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>Levy is hopeful that much of the displaced sand can be repurposed.
Pinellas officials are encouraging residents to cart their sand right
back out onto the beach — as long as it’s clean.</p>
<p>“Again, we just need to remove debris. I’ve seen some piles out there
with kitchen cabinets in it,” Levy said. “We’re going to have a problem
if we have a lot of that stuff out there.”</p>
<p>The county has also opened a drop-off location where residents can
leave sand for workers to screen and clean, or dispose of if it’s
contaminated, under guidance from the state’s Department of
Environmental Protection.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Florida residents are continuing to dig out of the
storm-driven sand, many of them by hand.</p>
<p>“Every shovelful is heavy,” said West, the construction contractor.
“This is horrendous, as far as the cleanup.”</p>

<h2 id="rare-copy-of-us-constitution-sells-for-9m-at-auction">Rare copy
of US Constitution sells for $9M at auction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Asheville, north carolina — A rare copy of the U.S. Constitution
printed 237 years ago and sent to the states to be ratified has been
sold for $9 million at an auction in North Carolina. </p>
<p>Brunk Auctions sold the document, the only copy of its type thought
to be privately owned, at the private auction Thursday. The name of the
buyer was not immediately released. </p>
<p>Bidding took just over seven minutes, with bids coming in at $500,000
intervals, mostly over the phone. There was a pause at $8.5 million,
then another after someone on the phone bid $9 million. </p>
<p>“Just another second or two. Savor it a little bit, selling here at
$9 million,” said auctioneer and auction house owner Andrew Brunk. </p>
<p>Brunk was thankful. The auction was originally set for September 28
but was delayed after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage
throughout Asheville and western North Carolina. </p>
<p>“It’s a privilege to have it here. It’s been quite a ride,” Brunk
said. </p>
<p>The copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished
drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and
sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government
under the Articles of Confederation, requesting it be sent to the states
to be ratified by the people. </p>
<p>It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that
Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the
other seven are publicly owned. </p>
<p>Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states,
essentially certifying them. </p>
<p>What happened to the document up for auction Thursday between
Thomson’s signature and 2022 is not known. </p>
<p>Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern
North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the
governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and oversaw the state
convention during his last year in office that ratified the
Constitution. </p>
<p>The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet
with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old
chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was
preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time
like a book. </p>
<p>Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet, printed front and
back, is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He
acknowledged there would have to be compromise and that certain rights
the states enjoyed would have to be given up for the nation’s long-term
health. </p>
<p>The Constitution copy wasn’t the only seven-figure purchase Thursday.
A watermarked 1776 first draft of the Articles of Confederation went for
$1 million. </p>
<p>Also sold was a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina at
Hillsborough, where representatives spent two weeks debating whether
ratifying the Constitution would put too much power with the federal
government instead of the states. The document sold for $85,000.</p>
<p>Auction officials were not sure what the Constitution document would
go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy
of the Constitution that was sent to the states sold, it was for $400 in
1891. </p>
<p>In 2021, Sotheby’s of New York sold one of only 14 remaining copies
of the Constitution printed for the Continental Congress and delegates
to the Constitutional Convention for $43.2 million, a record for a book
or document.</p>

id="dense-breasts-can-make-it-harder-to-spot-cancer-on-a-mammogram">Dense
breasts can make it harder to spot cancer on a mammogram</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>When a woman has a mammogram, the most important finding is whether
there’s any sign of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The second most important finding is whether her breasts are
dense.</p>
<p>Since early September, a new U.S. rule requires mammography centers
to inform women about their breast density — information that isn’t
entirely new for some women because many states already had similar
requirements.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know about why breast density is important.</p>
<p>Are dense breasts bad?</p>
<p>No, dense breasts are not bad. In fact, they’re quite normal. About
40% of women ages 40 and older have dense breasts.</p>
<p>Women of all sizes can have dense breasts. It has nothing to do with
breast firmness. And it only matters in the world of breast cancer
screening, said Dr. Ethan Cohen of MD Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston.</p>
<p>With the new rule, “there are going to be a lot of questions to a lot
of doctors and there’s going to be a lot of Googling, which is OK. But
we want to make sure that people don’t panic,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>How is breast density determined?</p>
<p>Doctors who review mammograms have a system for classifying breast
density.</p>
<p>There are four categories. The least dense category means the breasts
are almost all fatty tissue. The most dense category means the breasts
are mostly glandular and fibrous tissue.</p>
<p>Breasts are considered dense in two of the four categories:
“heterogeneously dense” or “extremely dense.” The other two categories
are considered not dense.</p>
<p>Dr. Brian Dontchos of the Seattle-based Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center
said the classification can vary depending on the doctor reading the
mammogram “because it’s somewhat subjective.”</p>
<p>Why am I being told I have dense breasts?</p>
<p>Two reasons: For one, dense breasts make it more difficult to see
cancer on an X-ray image, which is what a mammogram is.</p>
<p>“The dense tissue looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks
white on a mammogram,” said Dr. Wendie Berg of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser to
DenseBreast-info.org. “It’s like trying to see a snowball in a
blizzard.”</p>
<p>Second, women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly higher risk
of developing breast cancer because cancers are more likely to arise in
glandular and fibrous tissue.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, women with dense breasts are no more likely to die from
breast cancer compared to other women.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>If you find out you have dense breasts, talk to your doctor about
your family history of breast cancer and whether you should have
additional screening with ultrasound or MRI, said Dr. Georgia Spear of
Endeavor Health/NorthShore University Health System in the Chicago
area.</p>
<p>Researchers are studying better ways to detect cancer in women with
dense breasts. So far, there’s not enough evidence for a broad
recommendation for additional screening. The U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force called for more research in this area when it updated its
breast cancer screening recommendations earlier this year.</p>
<p>Do I still need a mammogram?</p>
<p>Yes, women with dense breasts should get regular mammograms, which is
still the gold standard for finding cancer early. Age 40 is when
mammograms should start for women, transgender men and nonbinary people
at average risk.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to replace the mammogram,” Spear said. “We want to add
to it by adding a specific other test.”</p>
<p>Will insurance cover additional screening?</p>
<p>For now, that depends on your insurance, although a bill has been
introduced in Congress to require insurers to cover additional screening
for women with dense breasts.</p>
<p>Additional screening can be expensive — from $250 to $1,000 out of
pocket, so that’s a barrier for many women.</p>
<p>“Every woman should have equal opportunity to have their cancer found
early when it’s easily treated,” Berg said. “That’s the bottom
line.”</p>

id="drone-maker-dji-sues-pentagon-over-chinese-military-listing">Drone
maker DJI sues Pentagon over Chinese military listing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — China-based DJI sued the U.S. Defense Department on
Friday for adding the drone maker to a list of companies allegedly
working with Beijing’s military, saying the designation is wrong and has
caused the company significant financial harm.</p>
<p>DJI, the world’s largest drone manufacturer that sells more than half
of all U.S. commercial drones, asked a U.S. District Judge in Washington
to order its removal from the Pentagon list designating it as a “Chinese
military company,” saying it “is neither owned nor controlled by the
Chinese military.”</p>
<p>Being placed on the list represents a warning to U.S. entities and
companies about the national security risks of conducting business with
them.</p>
<p>DJI’s lawsuit says because of the Defense Department’s “unlawful and
misguided decision” it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a
national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple
federal government agencies.”</p>
<p>The company added “U.S. and international customers have terminated
existing contracts with DJI and refuse to enter into new ones.”</p>
<p>The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>DJI said on Friday it filed the lawsuit after the Defense Department
did not engage with the company over the designation for more than 16
months, saying it “had no alternative other than to seek relief in
federal court.”</p>
<p>Amid strained ties between the world’s two biggest economies, the
updated list is one of numerous actions Washington has taken in recent
years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies that it says may
strengthen Beijing’s military.</p>
<p>Many major Chinese firms are on the list, including aviation company
AVIC, memory chip maker YMTC, China Mobile 0941.HK, and energy company
CNOOC.</p>
<p>In May, lidar manufacturer Hesai Group ZN80y.F filed a suit
challenging the Pentagon’s Chinese military designation for the company.
On Wednesday, the Pentagon removed Hesai from the list but said it will
immediately relist the China-based firm on national security
grounds.</p>
<p>DJI is facing growing pressure in the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier this week DJI told Reuters that Customs and Border Protection
is stopping imports of some DJI drones from entering the United States,
citing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.</p>
<p>DJI said no forced labor is involved at any stage of its
manufacturing.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns that DJI drones pose
data transmission, surveillance and national security risks, something
the company rejects.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. House voted to bar new drones from DJI from
operating in the U.S. The bill awaits U.S. Senate action. The Commerce
Department said last month it is seeking comments on whether to impose
restrictions on Chinese drones that would effectively ban them in the
U.S. – similar to proposed Chinese vehicle restrictions.</p>

id="us-lawmakers-seek-investigation-of-consulting-firm-over-work-in-china">US
lawmakers seek investigation of consulting firm over work in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A group of Republican lawmakers is demanding a federal
investigation into the U.S. consulting firm McKinsey over its work with
the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, even as the company
reportedly is revamping its China business to reduce risks. </p>
<p>A letter — signed by Representative John Moolenaar of Michigan,
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa — asks the
Justice Department to investigate whether McKinsey’s $480 million
contracts with the Defense Department comply with federal law when the
consulting firm also advised China’s national and provincial governments
and state-controlled businesses. The three accuse McKinsey of
misrepresenting its relationship with the Chinese government. </p>
<p>“McKinsey’s activities pose a serious risk to U.S. national security
and may have failed to meet McKinsey’s obligations under federal law,”
according to the letter dated Thursday. </p>
<p>McKinsey declined to comment on the letter but has in the past
defended its practices in China. It has said it follows the “most
rigorous and comprehensive client service policy in our industry.” </p>
<p>The consultancy also has said it does not work for the ruling Chinese
Communist Party or the central government but mainly with multinationals
and private Chinese businesses.   </p>
<p>The lawmakers’ scrutiny over McKinsey’s dealings with Beijing comes
as the U.S. and China are becoming increasingly competitive, prompting
American politicians to reexamine business ties to ensure Beijing and
its military would not get stronger with U.S. help. Beijing also has
grown wary of American companies.   </p>
<p>The Biden administration has imposed export controls to block China’s
access to advanced computer chips and limited U.S. investments in China
in areas such as microelectronics, quantum information technologies and
artificial intelligence. Last month, a Republican congressional report
raised red flags that partnerships between American and Chinese
universities could aid Beijing in developing critical technology for
military advances.   </p>
<p>U.S. companies, which have built experience in China over the past
several decades, are readjusting to the new geopolitical reality. This
week, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKinsey has cut back on
government-linked clients in China and reduced the workforce there by
nearly 500 people, or about a third. </p>
<p>The letter by Republican lawmakers accused McKinsey of helping China
“rapidly develop its military and economy” through its consulting
services. It said McKinsey failed to disclose its work with the Chinese
government while acquiring U.S. defense contracts, which amounted to
more than $480 million since 2008 and granted McKinsey “access to
classified or otherwise sensitive national security data.” </p>
<p>Bob Sternfels, McKinsey’s global managing partner, told the Senate
Homeland Security Committee’s subcommittee on investigations in February
that “we’ve never worked for the Chinese Communist Party or the central
government in China, to the best of my knowledge.” </p>
<p>The letter asserted that McKinsey may have misrepresented its
relationship with the Chinese government, citing public information and
documents.</p>
