<h2 id="the-problem-with-running-the-government-like-a-business">The
problem with running the government like a business</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
The idea that the government should be run more like a business isn’t
new. But with two businessmen, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, now taking a
proverbial chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy all in the name
“efficiency,” this theory is being put to the test. While it’s an
appealing idea, Philip Joyce, professor of public policy at the
University of Maryland School of Public Policy, said governments can’t
afford to take risks the way businesses can. On the show today, Joyce
explains the origins of the idea that the government should be run like
a business, how we define “success” differently for the two entities,
and how the way Trump and Musk do business is showing up in the White
House.

Then, we’ll break down the high stakes of today’s special elections in
Wisconsin and Florida. Plus, reflections on serendipitous moments in
walkable communities and what we gain by admitting we were wrong.

<h2 id="the-tariff-countdown">The tariff countdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
President Donald Trump has promised that a fresh wave of tariffs on
April 2 will usher in an era of growth in American manufacturing. But
does history bear that out? We’ll explain how steel tariffs under
President George W. Bush did more harm than good. And, in response to
Trump’s trade agenda, the “buy Canadian” movement is gaining steam.
American exporters are already feeling it. Plus, we’ll smile about
flowers, parties and the unspoken rules of texting.
